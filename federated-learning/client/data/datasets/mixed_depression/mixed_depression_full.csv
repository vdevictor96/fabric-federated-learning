1,"Okay.. a little about me. I'm married, with 3 lovely kids and an adorable husband. I have just taken a leave of absence from my job at The Home Depot. HD is a pretty good company, but all of the jobs are very demanding and most of my coworkers feel VERY overworked and consumed by their jobs. Before I worked at the store in my town, I worked at the Store Support Center (aka headquarters) in Atlanta, Georgia. I was involved in arranging travel for associates with the company, and also for assisting with employee/family relocations due to promotions/tranfers, etc. I really enjoyed my job in ATL, and miss my coworkers. Working at a store is a completely different world. I'm glad that HD hires people from all walks of life, different ages, colors, etc. But there is such a HUGE variety of experience in our store - it is very strange. We have 18 year old cashiers that came fresh out of the Kwiky Mart that wear their hip hugging bluejeans with the g-string underwear showing at the top and their boyfriends waiting on them out in the parking lot. We've got 55 year old experienced professionals that could build a house from the ground up with a crew of 3. We've got weekend warriors, firemen, schoolteachers, students, homemakers, who just want a part time job for a few extra bucks, and high school students working on the lot, pushing carts, and dreaming of making their way in to management one day. I guess VARIETY is the spice of life. And let me tell you - my store has a lot of SPICE. ",4185590.200408090.female.34.txt
0,"new to the forum and just like to share my depression with you all. I was verbally abused at school from the age of 9 right the way up until i left school, at the age of 10 i self - harmed because i felt worthless not wanted and thick. at the age of 13 my dad left, at the age of 15 i took cannabis to get me through school, people at school used to pick on me everyday ""for nothing"" i'd come home with tears dripping from my face go to my bedroom and cut myself with bits of glass. then at 16 the last year in school i used to get drunk before i went into school this helped me for a while it was the only thing i could rely on. anyway i'm now 19 years old and have a list of problems such as: Social phobia / Mild Agoraphobia, Anxiety problems, Depression, Paranoia, Delusions and Insomnia ""what a list eh!!"" I don't want to play this sick board game we call life, i don't want anything from life it has nothing to offer me. i've lost count of all the times i have wanted to kill myself. I don't trust anyone i have no friends and i just want to be in total solitude. Why can't people accept the fact i don't want to socialize? Why is that so wrong? I want to die but i can't at the moment because that would hurt my Mom, i'm stuck on what to do i just want to be put out of my misery i cant see i future for me. sorry for babbling on, i hope people reply talk soon ",fruitloop_e_2_a_c4_xx.txt
1,"It is amazing how the time of lunch comes so slowly. At work the time seems so relative, that I feel like I understand Einstein's theory of relativity, and I could even make my own contribution if I hadn't been so hungy. Sugar levels are dropping. Concentration diminishing.  As I correctly predicted the weekend was indeed cold and rainy and on the weather side really nasty. I have seen all types of rain on that day, and I do not care to see them that soon again. But otherwise the weekend was great. I was training my fiancee in driving on our fresh new car and on Sunday we went to see Kill Bill vol. 2 to another country and it was good.

One was from Turning the Page, an organization that does professional development for teachers and connects communities to schools.  They were calling for a second interview.  The other was from Hispanic CREO, a group that advocates for school choice reforms.  They offered me a (well) paid internship until something else comes up.

0,"I am  61 and for almost two years have been dealing with anxiety. It is strange the way of hitting and I would like to know from some of you experts if it is typical GAD. For almost two years I have been awakened almost every day at about 5:30 out of sound sleep with this feeling of anxiety. At first it hit my spine, now my stomach. If I take a xanax it will dissipate and not bother me much until later in the day. Again, no matter what I am doing I can feel it start to build, take a xanax and go on with life. By late afternoon it is gone and doesn't return until the next day. During this period my thyroid has been going haywire, probably from four surgeries in four years, the last being two months ago...a total knee repacement.. About sox weels before this surgery, after changing my thyroid meds a bit, the anxiety had left me. I was fine through the operation and then about three weeks after, it was back! Before the operation I was beginning to get some real bouts of rolling depression but they are gone for now ... just anxiety. The thing that I question is that it is the same no matter what is or has happened in my life for the day. I can have a great, relaxed day or a hectic, chaotic day and the next day will be exactly the same. My environment doesn't seem to affect it. Is all of this typical of GAD or should I redress my thyroid or other hormonal screw ups? Thanks for reading. It's really getting me down! ",jzzlvr613_e_2_c_c3q_us.txt

1,Husbands Family So long story short my husband use to live with his older brother and his wife and kids. My husband was always there for the kids he grew really attached to them. But since we got together and then got married he saw the kids less and less. So yesterday his brother’s wife texted him and asked him not to forget about his niece and nephew that they really miss him and that they notice that he no longer spends time with them. She says they are sad. So it kind of made me angry because ever since we got together my husbands mom his brother and the mother of the kids have always tried to push the kids on him. One time we had them over and we’re going to drop them off and well they got mad because we couldn’t keep them.  They always want him to be there for them like if he’s the father and he’s not his just the uncle. And I don’t like when he brings them over because it’s like they don’t even acknowledge I am here. The kids don’t like me and it’s noticeable I guess they’re mad because I took their uncle away. I’m I wrong for getting mad at this I mean we are going to have our on kids some day and I don’t need them getting jealous or not liking my kids only because he will no longer spend time with them. ,2021512l.txt
0,"Hello. I am just getting over a suicide attempt, my 2nd. It was extremely serious. I was planning it for week, and when I was fired form my job I did it the next day. I have a BS in chemistry and worked testing pharmacological products, so i knew what to take. I don't know what made me call my ex-BF. I did not speak to him for 4 months, but I wanted him to be the one to find me. Needless to say I lived. The doctors where surprised that I did. I took 3 things, (not going to give people ideas) that i knew they could not do anything for because of them being together. They could not pump my stomach cause of the one thing. They could not give any antidotes cause of interactions. I took well over the lethal limit. My life was spiraling out of control since Jan of 98. Since then, I have had 3 heart and 2 cancer operations. I was discharged from the Navy, was an officer, because of the medical stuff. My 1st suicide attempt was in the navy, they chalked it up to being stupid and not dealing with the 1st heart and cancer surgeries. My parents had a bitter divorce and I was caught in the middle when I got home. My mother assumed my ID and ran up a bunch of bills. I came out of the closet. I slept around to feel wanted. Which was not a wise choice, I gained my 3rd major medical situation. Not going to say what, but I am sure you can figure it out. I have a soul mate that I hurt, my ex-BF, and who knows if we will ever be friends or more. 2005 was a blur. I do not remember things, or saw things that where not there. Like documentation, which led to me being fired. I was afraid to leave the house, and was even afraid of 5 year olds selling candy for the school. The good thing about the suicide attempt is there was a proper diagnosis. I compartmentalized, and pushed emotions away. Every situation or moment had its own little box, and I put it away. I wanted to be like Spok or Data. I would put on different mask for different situations. There was shopping me, gas pumping me, heck, i had a separate mask for every action I performed. I have abandonment issues, from how i was treated growing up. Medicines did nothing and gave bad side effects. My depression is not chemical, but mental. I need to re-learn how to think and handle emotions and issues properly. Unemployment is running out, people are looking for money for bills. But it is better to be alive. WOW, this was longer than I intended. Just saying who I am, and I am a mess.....but slowly putting my life together. ",wolfram_e_1_b_1_us.txt
0,"I'm sitting here at what is my 26th or 27th job (I can barely keep count. I'm 27 years old by the way). I already hate it and I've been here one month today. I don't think it's normal to have this many jobs over a lifetime, let alone when you're just in your late 20's. I've applied for disability before but was denied. I don't dispute the fact that I can get a job, I just can't keep a job. I get bored, I get anxiety attacks, I get to the point where I don't want to go outside at all. I'll never be able to work (successfully) with all those things going on. When I went to see an attorney to appeal my disability decision, he said I should find a job with minimal responsibility. What kind of job is that? Don't you have to be responsible enough to at least come to work (and on time)? Don't you have to be responsible to follow the rules of the job? I can't seem to do either one. Each job I get, I think ""maybe this can be the job I can stay at"" and it never happens. The longest I've ever stayed at a job is 1 year. I just feel like such a loser. Everyone I know always says they'll do whatever kind of job for their kids, or I should be lucky to have a job. I can see their point, but when I feel so miserable I can't see past that. I drag myself to jobs only to end up quitting or getting myself fired. What's wrong with me? Any advice? Anyone?

YEEEAAAHHHH!    We love Disney World and have been at least twice a year since we were married back in 1991.  We most recently took the Disney cruise and absolutely loved every minute of it.  We have two kids, a boy who is 9 and a girl who is 7, and they both love Disney World as well.  So you can imagine our elation at getting to move to Orland!  Then reality struck us!!  My job doesn't have an office in Florida!  Oh no!  There is no way we could move if I didn't have a job to move down there to (we currently live in Indianapolis IN).  Well I work as an IT Manager/Project Manager so I thought I'd just hit MONSTER and DICE and bingo, the job offers would roll in!  WRONG!  After applying to over 30 job postings I haven't had a single reply of interest.  Ok so the first thing I did was get introspective.  Is it me?  Am I not employable in the year 2004?  Then I thought it was my resume, so I had a professional help me out with that.  He polished it to a fine sheen and I resubmitted it to DICE and MONSTER.  Guess what!!  STILL no hits!  I spoke to a recruiter in Florida who has assured me that I will NOT get any hits because I do not live in Florida!  WHAT!  I'm not even asking for relocation fees!  My wifes job has that covered.

0,"I need to get my life on track Im 23 year old black man who just graduated from one of the best universities in the US. I've been depressed as fuck for a large portion of the last 4-6 years. I have no money, no girlfriend(or prospects), and no social life to speak of. I had a solid social life in college but had no luck with girls. Made a lot of friends but none that I'd consider great ones. I'm  afraid of public expression, if I come out of this shell I'll just be that little underdeveloped, short loser who thinks he's the shit when he's accomplished nothing in life. I'm afraid of what other people think of me, do they think I'm smart? Do they think I'm nerdy? Do they think I can't dance? Do they think I'm too short? Do they think I'm attractive? Do they think I'm gay? Do they think my voice is deep enough? Do they think I'm laid back? Do they think I'm fake? Do they think I'm a pussy? Do they think I get girls? Do they think my dick is small? Do they think I'm dressed well? Do they think I'm shy? Do they think I'm lame for a black guy? Do they think I act too white? Do they notice the awkwardness when I talk? Do they think I speak well? Do they think I ask too many questions? This causes me to lie to the people around me, including my family about little things that it's unnecessary to lie about. To put on this front of fake confidence when inside I feel like I'm not worth shit. I blow off my friends and then justify it to myself that I'm somehow too good for them. I don't pick up phone calls from family members and try to keep to myself. I just do nothing all day and wait for shit to come to me. I'm not the guy that gets girls, when it comes to trying to actually start a relationship with a girl my awkwardness and lameness just begins to show itself and she immediately senses it and can tell I'm not shit. I've had sex with 2 girls in my life and couldn't actually bust a nut for whatever reason. I'm an asshole to the people around me that do really nice things for me but somehow my brain keeps justifying my behavior and I keep doing it. I can't bring myself to do anything that is remotely productive or will help me better my life. I'm self aware to the point where I know I'm being a complete piece of shit but I can't find the motivation to turn it around. It's like my brain telling me I'll be content just living in my parents house until I'm fucking 60 years old. Somehow when I look in the mirror I see myself as an attractive man, I just look super young for 23, people say I look as young as 16 so I'm also self conscious about that which also makes me put on this facade when I'm around people. Recently for long stretches of months I just go completely ghost and don't leave the house or do anything of use. On the bright side I've had many positive experiences in life where I've felt my potential as a person start to become realized. I have a degree in communication studies from a top 15 university in the US. I have a family that loves and supports me (but probably wants me to move out just as much as I want to move out). This is all pretty incoherent and stream of consciousness but my brain is just really jumbled right now and I had to vent. I need to turn my fuckin life around. ",raiderfan20.txt
1,"So these two girls published an article in the school newspaper about the cliques in my school. It's a horrible article. Like, get shot in the head and die. In it they listed what cliques exist at my school--The Asians (it's funny they list that as the first one, because thats the 'clique' they belong to) the Brown kids, The Ghetto Group, The Cheerleaders/Jocks/Preps, the Punks, the Goths and the Druggies. Okay, what the hell? There are 3 kids at my school that could be labeled punk. Two of them are actually Punks, and one of them is a good friend of mine. The other one is a girl who used to be punk, but now she's all...not. This entire article is about how we shouldn't be labeling kids because HEY!  That's what causes cliques!  And then they go and categorize every student at the school? Assholes.  And then, they thought it would be nice to teach me about these cliques.  Students feel acceptance and approval when they are with their ""own people"". How does one come to be labeled as a part of one of these cliques? The way one speaks, dresses common interests and tracking levels.   Tracking levels? Okay! I have no idea what that means.    Students who can be categorized in more than one clique are considered ""confused"". For Example, we were listening to two studens in our class talk about a boy who likes to dress more urban but he listens to rock music at the same time. People were making fun of the boy behind his back saying he was ""confused"".  Cry me a fucking river.  The article goes on about stupid shit.

People use that as an excuse?  They ended it by saying that the only way to change this is to make a difference...within. Fucking Hippies.  On that note, all i have to say is...

Since my dad died I've been honest to her about my limits towards me seeing his corps the day before burial and I've been crystal clear that this Saturday I didn't feel ready yet to go to the cemetery and I assured her that I'll surely go one day. An hour ago she told me that me telling her all of that is avoiding all those responsibilities. I'm shocked, I feel hurt, I feel anger and... Hatred... One of my coworkers told me ""don't do anything you have no strength for, don't push yourself, everyone grieves differently"". She's the only person that understands me... I will talk to her tomorrow because she will understand. She's such a kind person... But not... I feel so weak and I feel like sooner or later I will kill myself because that's too much, I have no one to realistically help me besides good words. I feel like now there's nothing that will hold me. At least i want to be understood by someone. I won't get it from mom, I feel like I won't get it from boyfriend. Im too tired, I really am. Please someone believe me. I have no where to go, nowhere! Please. ",DontKnowWhatImDoing-.txt
0,"Being told by my brother making friends isn’t that hard for someone my age bothers me every time I think about it It’s pretty damn hard when I have no hobbies to relate to anyone except stay in my room on my computer because I’d rather just be away from everyone so I don’t make it hard on them. And being told to go to clubs by my parents. I just feel more of a disappointment when I tell them there’s nothing I’m interested in and that I also am too afraid to still be alone when I join one. I’ve done everything I could in my life to try to fit in or make new friends, and there’s a reason why I have no motivation to try any of these anymore. And then they say it wouldn’t hurt trying. That couldn’t be any further from the truth. If I try to fit in again and still don’t have anyone to talk to, I’m gonna hate my life even more. It’s like I’m trapped. I can’t do anything to please me. One day I want friends, then the next I don’t want anybody at my school to bother me because I know they don’t really want me to be there friend. Why does depression always put you in a trap that you can’t get out of? There’s no solution except accept your problem and just be an introvert and ignore everyone. ",ThisIsntMyMain456.txt
0,"Hello everyone. My name is Amy. I discovered this page just by searching on the internet for depression forums. One good thing about me, I believe, is that I'm very mature for my age. I am seventeen, and really hope everyone here is open-minded to age being just a number. So please, do not reply telling me I will have it better later on, or my problems are because of my age. I know there is a possibility that things will get better, and believe me, I really do not think this has to do with teenage hormones. I have read about many middle aged women and men with the same problems. I understand that I am a very negative person, most likely due to depression. I am very irritable, only maybe once a week I am happy for most of the day. I also know that I have never really been happy. I have never been optimistic, and have always been sensitive, emotional, and not very confident. At the moment I do not have any friends. I haven't really had any friends for a few years now. Once every few months or so I'll go out, and then just want to leave within a couple of hours. It's very stressful to me. And when I do want to leave, I just tell myself I have a problem, because everyone else I know seems to get along with people just fine. I am also like this with jobs. I go in and out of jobs. One time I even faked a family emergency just to leave work...and I was crying about it. If one thing goes wrong for me, if I smile at someone and they don't smile back, if I feel insecure in any way, my first reaction is to flee. I also, for the most part of my life have always been in a relationship. My boyfriend as of right now and I have been together for over a year. Both of us cheated on each other in the beginning of our relationship, which might be the cause of our jealousy problems now(mostly mine). But, before this relationship, I also had the same problem. I never felt good enough, I believe I will never feel pretty enough. I have big issues with porn, and basically every little thing you can think of. Recently I've been reading about depression and anxiety. I feel the more I understand how and that it is a part of me, the worse I feel about myself. And the more insecure I feel. I feel like I am not fun to be around since I am irritable and sad most of the time. I feel like my boyfriend will find someone who has more of the good qualities. I feel that I will never satisfy or make my parents proud, since I keep leaving jobs. They tell me I'm just lazy. I have quit every single thing in my life that I've tried since I was young. But I really think it's because of my mental state. Going out in public is terrifying, because I don't want to feel bad, ugly, unfun, or not funny. I fear social situations, because I am horrible at making conversation. I've been considering therapy and depression/anxiety pills, but my mom tells me people who take them basically just don't feel anything at all. And I am also afraid to see a doctor and share my feelings. I feel like I have no one to talk to. My dad and I have never had a good relationship, we maybe say two words to each other a day. We have had kind of a bad past, and maybe that's the reason for our lack of communication. My boyfriend doesn't really know how to talk about important or emotional things, unless they have to do with him. I feel like every time I cry I push him farther away from me, and feel I have to hide everything because me being depressed is a turn off to him.  I don't know. I guess we all have to vent somewhere, and to know that there is a place where people feel the same is a great thing to me.  I wish there was an easy way to feel good about myself, and just be happy for once. But I suppose these things take time and a lot of effort. I'm sure I left some things out, but this is all I want to throw at you all for now. Thank you for listening. ",RainXD_e_2_a_c3_us.txt
1,"What makes someone weird? I've often been told by people (that like and don't like me alike) that I'm weird. I've become a guarded person because of it but I also embrace that others think of me as...unique. I am generally a confident person. I think I'm nice, genuine, smart and funny and have been told by others that I'm very attractive. What's always bothered me though is not quite knowing why people think I'm weird. I think this information could be useful for first impressions like dates or interviews so I know how to temper this a little. At least initially. The only thing I can think of is that I love horror movies. In general, my interests seem pretty average otherwise (shopping, reading, traveling, etc). So, what makes someone weird?

He ruined my inside. He cheats on me while i was pregnant. But he does not think he did bad things to me. When i said something, he always says that I'm stupid or crazy. He thinks he's right. Since last year, we moved to his country and living with his mother and sister. Because he works there. His family are nice to me. But my husband doesn't come back every day.. I have a baby but he doesn't support me. I haven't realized he's such a bad man.. He has hidden so many things from me.. So i thought he's a good husband. But he brought financial issues. And i have helped it. But he forgot that.. I want to leave him but i don't have money and i have a baby.. And I'm in different country.. No one is by my side. I cut myself almost every day. I have stopped it since i was 20. But situations make me do that. I would never wear short sleeve again. Too much scars. But i don't regret to cut myself. Because that's the only way to make me live.

1,"Should I attempt to repair our friendship one last time? So a few months ago a close friend and I had a sort of fight because I made a shitty passive aggressive comment. I apologised shortly afterwards and felt terrible about it, even apologised more a day later. Anyhow they said they needed some space, we happened to work together and sit right next to each other. So I left them be for awhile, they basically refused to even look or speak to me. After a month or so this started to take its toll on me, emotionally and mentally I wasn't equipped to deal with it. So eventually after 66 days of this, something I could not get away from I snapped and out of desperation as I was losing my mind I told I'm walking away as without communication the friendship is doomed. So that's where it ended, they then carried on ignoring me for the rest of our time at work, they eventually left to go to a new place. Even at the farewell I was ignored till the last 10 minutes then got some communication. After that a couple weeks later on my birthday they randomly wished me a happy birthday on a work group. Completely unexpected, sadly this confused the shit out of me and I drunkenly sent some message about being tired of all the hurt. Then I was blocked. I have since not contacted them in any way for over a month. Do I make another attempt and how would I word it or should I just leave it and see if anything happens, we were really close and I feel awful about hurting them.

1,"Hosted my sister’s baby shower, only to be a second thought the next day Hi Reddit! I’m wondering if I’m being too emotional about this and could use your opinion. I flew from Utah to Boston and arrived Thursday morning on a red eye. From 6am Thursday to 3am Saturday, my mom and I prepped for my sisters baby shower. I see her once or twice a year, but the three of us talk almost everyday on a group chat, and we’re close. My mom and I stopped prepping briefly Friday night to meet her, her husband, and her best friend (who flew in that night) for dinner- so that was the first time I was seeing her this trip, same as her friend. The best friend stayed at her house while I was staying with my mom. So Saturday we had the shower for 25 people. Huge hit. Sister was very very appreciative and loved it. I had brought my suitcase in the event I slept over there, so I could have more time with her Sunday morning. This is generally normal. Once the shower wrapped, her friend brought my suitcase down...sort of a “here you go, bye.” The main Sunday plan was to watch the AFC game back at her house, at 3pm. I woke up after some major sleep catch up at 10:30 and asked the mom/sister group text, “what should we do today kids??” To which my sister replied that her and her girlfriend are getting breakfast and meeting up with the girlfriend’s husband’s cousin (who also lives in Boston) and that they’d be back at the house at 2:30 before the game. My flight back to Utah is 6am Monday, so today (Sunday) was really the only time to see her. I didn’t respond to that message. Around 1pm I told my mom that I didn’t want to watch the game with them, and I’d rather go downtown and watch it in a bar since I was feeling extremely hurt after putting all that work in for her shower, and then feel like an after thought the next day. So, Mom and I went to a bar and watched it. Sister and her husband blew up at me for being so “selfish” and are not talking to me. Husband went so far as to say I’m not welcome to see the baby when he comes. Crazy. I guess I should have put a smile on my face and just showed up for the game at 3? I would have if I ever stopped crying. Thoughts?? ",UltraFly74.txt
0,"Hello again everyone, my real name is Mike. I found this site a couple weeks ago but have been pretty busy with the holidays and a new job. So I thought I would post a bit more about myself. This isn't easy since I am not that good at talking about myself but here goes. I am 35 years old and have been depressed as long as I can remember. When I was 12 or 13 years old I remember sitting in my closet in my room with the doors shut writing a suicide note. After talking to a friend of mine about 7 years ago who started going to a therapist and taking Prozac, I decided to go get help. I didn't even know to call it depression until I started talking to him. I was diagnosed with Dysthymic Disorder and have been on and off a couple different kinds of medicines, one of which was Effexor and the other one I can't remember the name but it started with and S. I have a bad habit of remembering every bad thing that has ever happened to me and continually go over and over it in my head. I will bring up something with my brother or sister and they say ""I can't believe you remember that"" and yet sometimes I am lucky I remember my own name. I just started a new job recently and will not have insurance until the end of January. I am seriously considering going back to a therapist and possibly getting on medicines again. I am tired of carrying around this baggage and want to do something about it. There are so many things I want to do with my life and seem held back by my depression. I found this site one night after feeling really depressed over something that I can't even remember now in the hope talking to people who knew how I felt and what I was going through.

0,"Why depression is, and isn't like a skinned knee: Some thoughts I had that I wanted to share I was just pondering depression, and I decided to jot down what I was thinking. It's sort of a good way to put words to what it feels like to suffer from depression. ____________________________________ Why it IS like a skinned knee: Depression usually comes in episodes for me, and a lot of people I've talked to. Sometimes I'll be doing okay, and then have a really bad day, or even a bad week. These episodes are sort of like skinning your knee. When you were little, skinning your knee feels like the absolute worst thing in the world. You think, ""OW, THIS HURTS SO MUCH! WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?!"" You feel so helpless. When you're an adult and skin your knee, you know what to do. You know that you're supposed to clean it, and put a bandage on it. And that's exactly what you do; you don't make a fuss. But, even though you clean it and bandage it, it's of course still going to hurt. It's a cut. You just ignore the pain, though, because you've already taken care of it, and there's not much else you can do beyond that. You just have to live with the fact that it's going to hurt for a while. Depression is the exact same way. When it happens, you know what you should do to handle it. The best way, backed by science and research, is what we've all heard countless times: Exercise, eat healthy, do something nice for yourself, clean your living space, listen to happy music, watch TV shows that make you happy, etc. So you know to do this stuff. But of course, it's not going to magically feel 100% better right off the bat. There's still that emotional pain there, just like the way a skinned knee stings. But you've already done everything you can to take care of it, so you have to live with it and wait patiently for the pain to go away. ______________________________________________ Why depression ISN'T like a skinned knee: Most people know that depression has a way of demotivating sufferers. Things you once enjoyed no longer interest you. Nothing seems like it has a point. But this also affects your drive to treat your depression. When you skin your knee, you just take care of it right away, you don't give any second thought to it. It's just what you do. With depression, you know that you should be exercising, eating healthy, listening to happy music, cleaning, etc. But you don't. What's the point? The difference is, that depression makes you NOT want to get better, or more accurately, not care about getting better. Sometimes, you're just apathetic and nihilistic, ""What's the point? I don't care. Getting better is too much effort."" Sometimes, you just want to wallow in your own despair. For me, when I feel this way, it's because I feel worthless and self-loathing. I think, ""I deserve to feel this way. I deserve this emotional pain that I'm going through. I don't deserve to feel better, or to be happy."" That's the vicious cycle that depression uses to keep you down. If you are reading this and have depression, I hope this helps you understand your own illness a little more clearly. If you're reading this and you don't have depression, I hope this gives you a good account of what it's like, so you can empathize with people who have depression. Stay safe, everyone.

0,"Am I Depressed? While I've been distraught and suicidal on and off since age fifteen, I've never been formally diagnosed with anything because I don't trust the mental-health establishment. I've only visited a shrink twice: once when forced by parents, a second time when pressured by a partner. Because of this, I'm reluctant to claim I'm depressed except in the loose, colloquial sense. Instead, I feel my rage and despair flow quite appropriately from my failure to fulfill my desires, achieve my dreams, and so on. I hate being alive and would adore a sudden death, sure, but that doesn't necessarily mean I'm depressed, right? I don't experience many of the symptoms of formal depression: I sleep pretty well most of the time, I eat okay, and I'm socially active. (I feel abjectly isolated, but empirically I spend a fair amount of time with friendly acquaintances at events and so on.) I resist the medical model of my mental state because it assumes the problem's with me rather than with the world. I figure I'd be okay if I had the basic level of social success normal folks have: a number of close friends and a healthy romantic/sexual relationship with one or more partners. I'm becoming increasingly confident my genetics and values combine to make forming meaningful connections with other humans effectively impossible. Because I yearn for such connections intensely, it's only rational that this dynamic would make my life unlivable. I'm not depressed. My brain ain't malfunctioning; it's as valid a pattern as any.

No one notices that I'm sad, and everyone thinks I must be really happy about how everything is going, and it just makes me feel worse that I can't be happy even when I have everything: every victory is hollow and ever action feels pointless. I don't even know who to talk to about this because I don't want to bother anyone, people have enough to worry about without me involving them in my problems, especially small ones like my feelings.

1,"Just found out my family’s opinion of me. I walked by the kitchen and they were all talking about what a loser I am. My mom was leading the “discussion”. Everyone was involved except my dad.  I told my dad what was going on and he  went off on them. I’m just in my room thinking about how hurt I am. Especially considering I’ve been doing all my moms chores for her. Pretty much doing everything she should do.  The only person who came to my defense was my dad. I told him I’m going to move out and he told me he wants me to stay. I think what really hurts is it feels like my whole family is against me. After hearing what they said, I kind of hate them. I think I need to get away from this situation. But I have literally have no one else. ",Selahe1998.txt

0,"I always wanted to go to the therapy but my very huge and overprotective gossip-loving family made this impossible for me to do Not only that but even a little hypothetical talk about it would instantly gain unnecessary panic like attention and after several phone calls to friends, family members with something like *""Hey Clara, he wants to go to the therapist. Is this normal? Which one should we call? Do you know anyone? Ask John please!""* And next day there will be several people touching my hand and saying ""Hey are you fine?"" Making it feel like something is wrong with me when I just want to talk to a professional in person without feeling like a babe. How do I know? Because my sister was depressed once and I've seen how everyone reacted to it. You see, my family's  never changing mentality is ""we need to fight together! We are there for you (goddamn Fairy Tail guild or something)"". I don't blame them and I bet there are people who'd exchange everything only to be with someone as supportive. But I have always hated attention so much since I remember my self as a kid. Ironically enough I've had the biggest birthday parties in the town to boost this 'weird' hate. Doing it secretly will be risky because I actually work in my family's business as well so my tight schedule and the fact that my town is pretty small makes this almost impossible. And if someone finds out I secretly go to talk to a doctor it will have even worse reaction than just straight out telling them. Maybe I'm overreacting and have too much pride in me or no balls to admit to my family but sometimes I wish I could get invisible for just a week to sort my inner problems out. Sorry If this feels like I'm trying to make it harder for you guys to make some suggestions. It's way more complicated than that I just wanted to let it out. I've read some posts here and some of them were so so dark that my problems actually fade away a bit and I felt better because I said to my self *""yo... you are being a bitch right now, look at these people suffering here, you aren't even close!""* (don't know if I'm being terrible for healing my little wounds by reading how other people suffer).

0,"Anhedonia.. anyone else experience it? I just want to vent and have some insight. I never ""fall"" in love anymore. I'm lucky if I can even feel love. My current boyfriend is so supportive, but as the past few years of my life, just can't fall in love. I don't feel the own love or care for my family or friends. I don't care if something happened to my friends, and I don't care if I never see my loving, caring parents again for a long time, or ever. I don't care to help friends or family with anything. I have no passions in life. I have no hobbies. I'm not passionate about my family, friends, work, school, boyfriend, hobbies, my Jeep, animals, etc.. NOTHING excites me, brings me happiness or joy or peace. OCD, anhedonia and depression control everything. The only moments of Bliss I get are sometimes with my boyfriend, I get giddy about thinking about our future, or seeing a selfie he sent me while at work and make me swell. Those are occasional, but the only thing I ever feel that's positive to a somewhat major degree. I think my new birth control (first time on it) has made my depression worse. I don't believe in antidepressants for myself. I've been stressed out so much I've lost a bunch of weight too. Now that I've vented, I just don't want to feel alone. I want this to go away. I want to be excited to see my boyfriend at the end of the day, and excited for the day I may marry him. I want to have a hobby I am passionate about.

I'm sorry things ended badly. I'm sorry that for months after they spiraled out of control. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I let you down, your family down. I'm sorry I buckled. I'm sorry I didn't have the experience or the know-how to react to certain situations. I'm sorry that I made mountains out of molehills. I'm sorry at times I treated you badly, that at times I held you back. Three years later, we live totally different lives than back then. I got that job. I traveled the world. I went to Italy - twice. I've been to Times Square at midnight, and so have you. I did it all, but by myself. It's not what I wanted. It's not what I envisioned. You can't just replace somebody special with another person, and that you were. Special. It's been three years. Despite some triumphs and successes, it still feels like I lost a war. An immense failure that didn't personify my persona, it personified myself. On the surface, I'm told I seem ambitious, fully ready to attack each day. On the inside, I feel defeated. In the end, you found somebody new, which is fine. I chose, whether consciously or unconsciously to stay on a different path. I've tried new women. Many beautiful on the outside, but they aren't you. Oh no, no, no. They all don't have what you had. Not even close. Maybe one day I will end this crusade against myself, against the past. I can't change it, I can't alter the story, I can't lie to myself. I wish I could tell you I'm sorry. But it wouldn't change anything. For you it's a battle that was fought long ago.

I haven't phoned them in 2 weeks, I just don't have the courage to talk to them. I guess they feel that I blame them for my condition. Same with my remaining 2 sisters. Dang what a situation I have put myself in! I still have a group of friends that like me a lot, but I haven't told them about suffering from depression. I hide it inside and either act in anxious way or I do solitary activities such as write poems, play the piano or swim. I guess the main embuggerance is that I finding the third year of my course a real struggle at the best of times, but having understanding tutors and talking to doctors that have depression help. I don't know why things have turned out the way things are, why I struggle with anything remotely challenging, but I guess that will never be explained. Sometimes i feel frustrated with the way things have turned and I can do very little to change the current of of my present situation. I feel kind of sick with stuff at the moment. Not that I am assuming a victim complex, but just that in all the poems I write about, I always seek a sanctuary from the business aspect of life, you know the dog eat dog, go compete with others to get a job and survive for the next 55 years of my projected lifespan. Yeah pretty heady thoughts I'm having! I guess I'm just scared of the future. I don't know how to survive, I kind of want to blank the future out. I guess all in all, I want to live a simple life and be decent to others. I would like the people I meet in the future to say hey that Haymond guy was a splendid fellow who really loved people and would go out of his way to help them, because he could. But than an inner anxiety knows that I have hurt people from withdrawing into myself and by depression's virtue being too self indulgent. That hurts the most, knowing I hurt people from my depression. I never intended to harm anyone or be this way. If I could smile and be happy I would, but I can only show the scars of my mental pain as a testament to self torment. Don't get me wrong, I smile sometimes and even rejoice in the company of those friends in normal health, but I guess I feel rejected. Self rejection and by that of the stigma of the people of the same age I encounter on campus and at home. I want this to stop I guess. I want a placebo pill that will transport me to the Elysium fields, because sometimes reality is a bugger to experience. I guess the main message is that I want respite from this life, some form of relief and rest, where I will achieve or obtain this elusive elixir of peace. But I'm here, still standing, still finding a lot of life a challenge, still merging into a crowd of people who are too proud to admit that sometimes things may be too much. Who am I and what am I doing here ... I haven't a faintest clue. Yeah, I'm scared of defeat, of a battered ego that even a shred of self esteem that I had will be allowed to fly in the fresh wind. Its sounds like I'm asking for love ... I guess I am. Also that I would love some help, and in no small measure I have requested that help from doctors and therapists and talked to you my dear friends. But I find it extremely hard to help myself, to make amends with the very mind that hurts me so. I don't know what to think is what I wrote at the top of the blog, now seems apt to include it in the conclusion. I guess spilling my emotions has made me feel somewhat dizzy!

I freaking loved her, but after reviewing some medical expenses we would have to pay, we had to give her back to her shelter after only a month or so of having her. I was heartbroken. I came back to school on Monday this week and told my friends. Now in my friend group of three, there is one guy who loves to make fun of us. One of my friends is fat so he makes fun of his weight. I'm gay and he makes fun of me for being a faggot. My other friend does weed and he makes fun of him for being a drug junkie. But I think he crossed the line this time. He made fun of me by saying ""you killed your dog"" and all he's been doing this week has been calling me a ""dog killer"" and telling everyone that I am one. The annoying part is my best friend in the group is tagging along with this joke and they both think it's okay to make fun of me for this. I'm kind of embarrassed to say this, but I'm a very emotional person and I suffer from depression so it's hard for me to deal with this kind of stuff. Today when they started making fun of me again for being a ""dog killer"" I left and hid in the bathroom cause I just wanted to cry and I did. I hate it when people are mean to each other and it really hurts when someone does it to me. That, and the fact I was really sad about Carly leaving me makes me just not want to talk to them anymore.

I miss my dog, I've been really depressed as of recently, and my friends are making fun of me. What should I do about my friends, honestly?

They are going to be the ones who determine whether I can get disability pay or not! Whatever happened to just taking the word of the doctor?? I wonder who the insurance company can tell? I forgot to ask them if this is going to be kept confidential.  They also asked how this is affecting my job, I felt if I gave the ""wrong"" answer, they will decide not to pay me. I wonder what they are going to ask my shrinks, and how much info the shrinks can give them. Also, I understand that the shrinks / therapists can break the confidentiality rule if you threaten to hurt yourself or another --- that I can understand, but if you are ever on trial for something they can subpoena the doctors and they have to tell ALL!  That is ridiculous!  What happens if I am just a witness to some crime, but did not do the crime.  What happens if the lawyers want to discredit me so they put my shrink on the stand to ask what a nut I am? Just ranting, but opinions, feedback would be appreciated. ",blueocean7_e_2_b_c3r_xx.txt

0,"I feel like a useless member of my family I may not help as much as the perfect husband would around the house. But, I’d like to think I do a decent share of what traditionally a husband should be doing. My wife is not the most organized person in the world so me and her butt heads a lot when it come to finding things around the house. Car keys, laundry, tools, you name it, they will get lost around the house. I have tried taking my own copies of keys with me in my backpack to work or where ever I go. This way I don’t have to be asking her all the time where to find X item. This was working til she lost her copy of the truck keys and had to call me to bring my copy to her one day. Since then, I only bring the key of the car that I bring with me. Well,.... didn’t take too long til that one got lost too.... I needed to use the truck and was not able to find any key anywhere. I asked her where it was and she responded with “you have hands and eyes, you find it”. I blew my top off. I yelled at her that the fact that I have to hide things for them to not get lost in the house is ridiculous! She brought up the fact that I could do more around the house like organize the laundry or help her keep the home tidy. I told her I would if she wasn’t so damn unorganized. Every time i do end up helping her organize and clean she ends up messing everything up the next day anyway! She is type A personality and I would like to think I am type A-. I yield to her way of living most of the time til it gets to be too much. Maybe the reason I don’t do more around the house is because it will yield the same results anyway, an unorganized mess.... I at least do the basics. I pickup after dinner. I take out the trash, (this job now goes to my son). Handyman work, I fix plumbing, appliances, broken doors, tv’s, computers, iPhones. I would like to think that I play my role as a dad as perfect as I can. I help with homework, I play with my kids all the time. I feed them when mom works early or wants to sleep in/go to bed early. She’s mad at me and I feel like I am trying my best but my best is not good enough. Also, says I have become obese because of my laziness...... that one really hurt.....

1,"I just finished reading G.K. Chesterton's ""The man who was Thursday"" on sunday.  I think it is possibly among the more thought stirring books I have ever read, especially the following lines ""When I saw him from the back, I was convinced he was a devil.  But when I saw his face, I knew he was a God.""  It was one of the more powerful lines of the novel, and I won't tell you much more because I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't read it yet.  I think the most amazing books I have ever read (outside of the Bible) have been mainly fiction ones, that touched my heart rather than the philosophical ones that expanded my mind.

So we all (a group of people...I guess as opposed to dogs, cats, aliens, or rubber duckies) decided we wanted to take a walk along the canal. However, the weather decided it was going to rain at the same time. Now, rain would usually stop a sane person from taking a walk outside, but no...no one ever said we were sane. So we walked...in the rain and lightning and thunder...with umbrellas held high...all in the name of fun (and, oh yeah...exercise).  My official battle cry was, ""It's just water.""

1,"So there's this life I'm living, and only some know about parts of it, and I can't really write yet about any of it. Every time I find somewhere I think I'm comfortable writing, someone steps in and takes that feeling away, swiftly and murderously. I like to write, it's obvious, I've been doing it for years, but I like to write what I want, about whatever I want, and it's hard to do so while striving for anynomity. I hate having to hide behind a mask of unrecognizable features, just to tell the story of my life. The true story of my life, no frills, no strings attached, the real deal. But there some who who'd most definitely not approve, and though I can't blame her for getting upset at the things I do and think about, I can't help it, it's just how I am. It's the life I live, and I'm still not being very specific. Do you know, that if she were to read this, she'd hound me until the year's end asking what I'm talking about, what things in my life I do but can't write about, what would upset her, blah blah, and we all know how that goes, surely. So instead, I find another spot, and take my time trying to find comfort in that spot, with intent to eventually just write everything. I tire of taking out a pen and notebook, jotting everything down, while knowing I'm the only one who gets to read it. I'm a bit conceited, self-centered maybe, when I say I want others to hear my story, too. That's what these sites are all about, though, writing as a sort of entertainment towards others. That's just what we all like to do.  So with that all said, give me a few more entries where no one specifically is asking me anything, and I'll start writing about the real thing. Until then, please bare with my rambling. ",4126510.200408090.male.26.txt

1,"Gossiping in the family Hello. I am not sure whether this fits in this sub but I am going to ask it anyway. My family is a known gossiper. All of them tend to gossip about me. I am the odd ball, the one who doesn't agree with them. The one they all tend to chat about. Many times we have arguments, they all gain up on me. I will have my mom, dad, and older sisters all attacking my character- telling me I am no good and that I am poison . I have caught them in a few instances; but they brush it off. Often, they pretend I am being paranoid or they play dumb and be like, ""I did nothing, we said nothing."" Sometimes they complain about someone else to use it to get to me. It's really bothersome. It makes me feel so betrayed, confused, and really angered. I also not my family learns things about me before I even told them- mainly negative. There are lists of inconsistent gaps. I try to confront them but they immediately dismiss me. They try to cover up their tracks and always tell me I am paranoid. I know lots of the advice will be to confront them, but I do not believe that will work. I have tried that- all kinds of approaches but they insist they did nothing even when I catch them saying things about me. My mother does it the most. Often she, gossips after work with my sisters or sometimes with my dad. Sometimes my sisters gossip about me together. I have become the play thing in the family- my problems and life is just a giant joke they can share their contempt for. It's hurts. It's hard not to give a shot because it's your own family.

1,"It was summer - the leather seats on my Granny's navy blue Cadillac were hot and sticky.  Going to the bank with Granny was a normal kind of errand for me and my little brother.  The First American Bank tellers were very kid-friendly; they always sent suckers for us kids when they sent back the money for Granny.  On this particular day, Granny had a telephone set in the floorboard of her car.  She was the queen of mail-order catalogs, and she had gotten this red telephone, with a red cord and handset, from one of the many catalogs that filled the end tables at her house.  The phone had big black touch tone buttons, and I was amusing myself by making lots of clicking noises as I ""dialed"" familiar numbers.  In 1987, my 8 year-old self was impressed by the thought of a phone in the car.  No one that I knew, like my parents, family or friends, owned a car phone.  As we rode down Nolensville Road, dialing those numbers made my imagination wander and soon the receiver found its way to my ear.  I became lost in a whirlwind of conversations.  Instantly, I became a wealthy young woman (since I had a ""car phone""), who was talking to famous people like country singer Reba McEntire or actor Patrick Swayze.  Patrick called me right as we pulled up to the teller at the bank.  Granny would have to get my sucker for me today - I was far too busy talking with Patrick about doing a movie next month to stop and wave at the smiling lady behind the glass.  I felt so important.  I rode around talking on my car phone for at least two weeks, until my brother pointed out that you could see the cord, and that made me look dumb.  He was just jealous that Reba didn't want him to come over and go swimming in her new heated swimming pool. ",4206523.200408120.female.25.txt

It is smaller to our Rite Aides or Drug stores in the States. The only difference is they don't carry drugs. On the Apotheke pharmacys carry any such over the counter remedy's. My daughter had dropped her binki or pacifier while we were walking and so i had to get a replacement for her and the best to go for that was Budni. Kowing that they carried such items. After getting my stroller in the store and wading threw all the people i had found what i was looking for. I then heading for the line to check out. Since the store is crowed most of the time,even on Mondays, I had to push my way to get in line or other people would just get in front of you again with the no personal boudries issue. If you leave room for another person someone will think that it is meant for them and just cut in front of you no second thought. Well as i approached the counter of this young cashier, she of course never sported a smile to customers but instead basically looked up briefly and gave the look of NEXT! My turn! I said Hi! and she said Guten Tag, meaning Hello back. My total was 1,98 euros. I gave her 2. She then in turn was asking if i had any change but because I dont speak the language i didnt understand what she was saying to me. What kinda of change would she need for 1,98? Two was good enough. All she had to do was give me back two cents. But because i didnt understand what she was saying i did understand her body language which ended up in a huff and a puff from her.

1,"Hello and blessed be to all! Well, this is the beginning of my new journal. I had one on AOL, but for personal reasons moved my writings of my escapades to BloggerLand. I've also had numerous physical journals and I've only recently started online journals. As you can see, I love to write. It is one of my greatest passions and sometimes I must write to feel better.  I'm also just as passionate about history, theater, and Paganism. So I guess you could call me a Pagan writer-actor-historian.   Lil' bit bout myself: My name's Brian and I'm 17, living in Hartford, CT. I go to Bulkeley High School and the Academy of the Arts, and I'm overall happy with that. I'm a senior now, and life doesn't seem any different. I guess it's because of my up bringing that I feel like that. You see, I live with my mother, stepfather, and three brothers and our family's pretty boring. For all you kids out there with no siblings, I HATE you. You are too lucky. Siblings-especially brothers-can be a pain in the arse. Trust me, I have three of them!!   A couple of things have made my existence a bit more bearable. Firstly, my faith. I am a proud and out-of-the-broom-closet Pagan who loves the Great Mother. I've been Pagan for five years, and my specialty is healing and the Tarot. I have more Pagan books than I don't know who, and for the most part they were worth the money. I'm also blessed with the gift of the arts. I have dabbled in just about all the arts: painting, photography, songwriting, puppetry, but my two favorites are theater and writing. Though I don't want to be a professional actor, I still at least want to be an  amateur  actor; amateurism deserves more dedication than a hobby, but not as much as a profession.  I just love the theater, but being a professional actor is too harsh a life for me. I want to be a history professor. It isn't as exciting as being an actor, but I love it nonetheless. It is also a very flexible career, and it'll allow me to write--my other passion.     I hope to one day be a published author, but right now I'm just writing. I usually never finish a story or elaborate an idea, but at least I'm writing it down. Eh? I write all kinds of shtuff, but short stories are my speciality. As I continue to write in my journal, I'll slip in a piece or two to entertain any and all.    Well, that's enough writing for now. Enjoy my escapades!! ",4333070.200408240.male.17.txt

1,"Thoughts on multi-family and multi-generational households and family disagreements Basically, I married into a Filipino family, and my MIL owns a fairly large chunk of farmland. She routinely expresses a desire for ""all of us"" (myself, my wife, our two kids, my sister-in-law and her husband, my brother-in-law, his wife, and his kid) to build a large house with a large living area. Each of us (read: each family) would get our own rooms, everyone would live together, and we'd all be one big happy family. Except, not. I have a number of reasons for saying ""absolutely not"". Maybe it's my POV as someone that was raised in America, but I value independence and privacy. I want my own life, and my wife feels the same. Having family involved in everything you do, always having your kids being compared to other kids in the family, and always being treated like a child just sounds like hell. Not having the freedom to have sex or even choose what to have for dinner sounds like hell. No thanks. It's be really easy if her MIL wasn't a good person, but she is probably the most kindhearted person I've ever met. She's always there to help us out, financially or if we need anything else. We're there for her the best we can, too, of course. So it feels really bad to turn it down, especially since I understand enough about her culture to know that this would feel like a slap in the face. And there's the financial aspect, since the land is already family-owned. Acting disinterested doesn't work. Anyone else have family that has tried this? ",x_Omni.txt

1,"My bestfriend ruined my life. So, I am a 21 year old girl. I go to college, it's my third year and it all started two, almost three years. This girl, my ""best friend"" told me that her old friends from primary school came to see her and she invited me. I rejected it. I am very shy and anxious around people and she knew it. They were both boys, one of them being her old love interest and one of them... well. My future love interest, the man I thought my future. I've never been in a relationship, like I've said my depression and anxiety made me believe that I am not worth it and nobody is going to love me. So she asked that he wants to meet with me and how he can do that etc. I wanted to give my number to him, I told her that I would love to talk with him because she told me a lot about him. A basketball player -my favorite sports-, goes to San Francisco State University, loves motorcycles -like me- and wears all black -like me- and has blue eyes, dark hair etc. She told me that he doesn't use any social media, even his phone because he hated them as a kid too. I was like okay it's a oersonal preference. Like, at this point I wasn't serious. Because I didn't think he would like me. So I said let's try to talk with him because someone like him wouldn't like me anyway. On my 19th birthday I got an e-mail. It was from him. He was telling me happy birthday, how he wanted to write me and meet me. I was stupid, I flew with his message and we started talking. It was so beautiful. He was so sweet and kind. He was everything I wanted. Times go by, we decide to try ""us"" in a relationship. Mind you, until then I haven't seen him once, even though I asked to see his face. Not because I only care about physical stuff, because it was too good to be true. My mind, my mind wasn't accepting the fact that someone like him would like me. We started dating, talking each other 24/7 but without any Skype or calling. I haven't heard his voice once. One year passed, I totally fell in love, he told me he was in love and because of his family problems he couldn't open himself. Few things ruined me after our magical but almost ""it's nothing but a dream"" year. First he lied to me about visiting me 3 times. He told me that he gor the ticket and he was on the way to the airport. He never came. Second time I cried my heart out because of an accident. We were talking with my ""bestie"" the girl who met us, and she send me a conversation quotes. Her argument with one of her friends. When he sent an e-mail... The exact conversation she sent me was on the bottom of his mail. We used to send tons of hearts with each mail, I guess she forgot copying the hearts again. And sent me the conversation. Third time he decided to talk on Kik. You know after almost 1.5 years I wanted to speak normally, not with e-mails. I was so happy, I forgot everything he did to me, especially the mental abuse and fights about my male friends,  I said yes  open yourself to me, let me be with you etc. I was happy. A message came to me from an account with his initials. However without me having a chance to look at the message a notification about my bestie appeared on my phone, let's name her ""Aurora"" about opening a Kik account with his initials. I asked her what the fuck was going on and she told me it was a joke. He never send a message from Kik. Over time, my mental position got worse and worse. I'd hurt myself regularly, I'd cry at nights and I'd walk around without any emotions. Our friendship whit my ""bestie"" did end before me and he ended. When she got a new phone, her e-mail app gave an error. Until she fixed it he didn't mail me even once. Fourteen days. When her phone got fixed, he started writing me immediately. I knew it was her. I knew it was her from the beginning but I was too hopeful to believe that someone would love me. Now I'm here, with tons ıf new friends, friends I've made after her i, because her rude actions and poisonous words left us alone in the class. However I cannot deal with it. I still hope that he was real. I cannot stand the idea about a HUMAN BEING can do such a thing to a person she called as friend. I cannot deal with it. I would love to have some advice. It's been 2 weeks since my second semester has started but I cannot go to school because she will be there. And I am afraid I may hurt myself or worse, I may hurt her at some point.

I found out to have it filled it would be 130$.  My god what do they think I am made of, Money? Well anyway, I won't be getting that anytime soon.  Then when I came home Pat made a really good stir fry for supper.  But then Karmen was really cranky tonight and my cat got hit by a car.  The cat's ok though so that was good. I have had such a day of ups and downs. But I am still able to say I had an ok day.  I still don't know how to post pictures on here.  But when I can I will put a picture of my beautiful baby doll.  She is positively gorgeous.  I have a job interview next week and I am really nervous. I don't know how well it will go with no voice, and I get nervous in interviews.  When I get nervous I ramble.  So I have started preparing I have over 200 questions I am going to plan the answers too, I am going to plan the questions I am going to ask them at the end and I am researching the company.  That is all I can do besides remembering to breathe.  I just feel I have to make an extra big impression perferably on the good side, since I don't have much of a voice.  So any advice you can give me for my interview would be great:) I hate interviews.  I can write wicked resumes and a good coverletter, but I suck at the talking to people. They intimidate me, and I can not seem to picture people in their underware no matter how hard I try. I never know what to wear to interviews either.  I always feel like I am under dressed for them.  I don't own a ""business suite"", what I have are dressy clothes but to me they don't scream interview clothes.  Anyway I think I have rambled enough for today. ",3451235.200405270.female.24.txt

0,"I have just now realized now, after 24+ years of experiencing it, that what I've suffered from is depression. Soon after that, I spoke to my dad about it, and learned he'd been on AD's for over 10 years now, and he said he probably could have used them from the time he was about 15 years old on. He also said my paternal grandmother's side of the family was all just like us (my dad and I are almost carbon copies of each other, except he's always seemed much more ""perfect"" to me than I am.  ) He also said my oldest half brother is also on AD's. I also talked to my oldest daughter (who's 21 year-old), and she said she's been on AD's a few times too. I can say also that I learned many years after his death that my maternal grandfather experienced severe depression before I was born. He had shock therapy multiple times it seems...but I don't know if his problems were entirely from the extreme horrors he experienced in WWII, or a combination of that plus other problems. When I knew him he was always a sweet loving, rather quiet, man (and my favorite person in the world other than my dad.) My dad said he never associated my problems with depression (of course, neither did I), but now it all clicks. I wish I'd known all this when I was younger, that depression hadn't had the stigma it had back in the 1970s & 80s, and that I could have gotten treatment back then. Of course, if I had, I wouldn't have the same life I have now, so I guess I can't complain about that (and honestly wouldn't change a thing...I wouldn't risk losing my kids or what I've accomplished, no matter how crooked and difficult the path as been). But I will definitely watch my young kids now for signs of depression (especially my 4 year-old daughter, since she seems to have a similar personality to my dad and I). If I see it, they will get the treatment they need immediately! So in that sense I think this is a blessing...knowledge is power. ",killian_e_2_b_1_us.txt

0,"As expected, I lay awake for most of the night worrying about that bloody box! No such worries today though... �8,500... ""Deal""! That program really is terrific... must have been a real mastermind that thought it up... no doubt it was devised by one of those geniuses who is a member of Mencap. Anyway, you may be wondering how my trip to the shrink went this morning. Well, as ever, a bit of a disappointment (well I am here to moan you know!). Those of you who think that you lie down on a couch at the trick cyclists should dispel any illusions about reclining on a sumptuous Chesterfield sofa (unless you're going private). Not on the NHS I'm afraid. Mrs. Mo and I get to sit on wee NHS chairs around a coffee table. Well I say ""coffee"" table, as it is a small, low table covered with a brown Fablon veneer, but it has never held coffee on it as far as I am aware. The psychiatrist is a nice bloke though. We shall call him Dr Elton... not because he is profoundly superficial, childish and sulky, nor does he have an eternally patient partner called Mr. Furnish. No we shall call him Dr Elton because he bears a striking resemblance to Ben Elton... (even the gestures are spot on!) I always expect him to make a grand entrance in a sparkling diamante suit, holding a microphone and spouting swear words and political satire. However, he is usually markedly restrained. I still hang on the edge of my seat during the session, expecting some Freudo/Eltonian analysis ""Do you ever dream about showing Mrs. Thatch your fun sized Mars bar? you do, don't you, you snotty little shit"" but Dr Elton usually just asks me how my mood has been. Strangely enough, my GP is also a look alike, his double is Michael Portillo. Whatever complaint I presented to my old GP, whether it was an ingrown toenail or appendicitis, he would invariably respond ""Stop smoking and get back to the gym"". Dr Portillo however, responds to any complaint with ""Stop immigration and get back to Victorian values"". I also recently saw a psychologist who looked like Paul Robertson. But you probably won't know Paul unless you were in 3rd year in my school back in 1975. He sat behind me in physics... alopecia... furry pencil case... specs... no? never mind. (If you're reading this Paul.. hi!... sorry about calling you Kojak). Well that's enough about my celebrity medical staff. You're no doubt desperate to know how I got on at B&Q. Well, I hung around outside until the store was nice and quiet and then slunked (can i say slunked, as in slunk in?) in. I nearly went to the Customer Service desk but it was manned, as ever, by a very sad looking woman who looked as though she had just ran over a puppy and due to her guilt was avoiding eye contact with everyone. Not wishing to exacerbate her canicidal shame, I carried on to the kitchens department (she also looked like she would kill anyone who went within 3 feet of her and she was dangerously close to the power tools). The nice helpful lady in the Kitchens department was nowhere to be seen, so I reluctantly approached a uniformed youth who was gazing up at the ceiling in what appeared to be a catatonic state. I tested his waxy flexibility by arranging his limbs in a variety of postures and sure enough he remained motionless in whatever position I placed him. I explained my dilemma with the missing oven light and led him to a similar oven which was on display. I removed the light fittings and explained it would save a lot of hassle if I could just take these rather than order replacement parts. He raised an eyebrow at this point which I interpreted as ""That's an excellent idea sir, please take these and go home"". I pocketed the parts and left, after carefully positioning the salesman back where I had found him. ",mo_e_1_b_1_au.txt

1,"Money and power are your friend, not human beings! I am cynical about friendship from my recent experience. I am from a well-off family but I’d tried to live by my own and lived in a very tiny studio. To my well-off friends, I might look humble. They partied, traveled, and dined together without me, and kept those in secret (some of those events were blurted by mutual friends). Especially one of them frequently ignored me. When I really needed someone in order to be discharged from a hospital, that person didn’t help me even though she could - she didn’t even hide it. My parents didn’t like me living in a small place rent, so they bought me a very nice condo. Those well-off friends learned this news and they were excited about it. The woman who’d been ignoring me and hadn’t helped me out, volunteered to help my moving. I refused. When I had a house warming with them, they saw my place and was anxious to be invited to any of my future parties at this new place (yes, it’s a really nice place.) And then, they started to invite me to their exclusive parties and dining gatherings. They even asked me why I put some distance from them. It was ridiculous.

1,"Last Sunday I completed my first long run, 5 miles. Not bad. I followed the suggested training regimen this week, even the Friday cross-training session. My packet of training info suggested that “pool running” was, “…hands down the best cross-training activity for runners…”. I decided since I bought a swimsuit last fall, I would put it to good use at Yale's Olympic-sized pool.   The only person in the area who didn't think I was a complete idiot was the undergraduate student lifeguard, whom I informed of my intent to “pool run”. He was a member of the Yale swim team, and, “very familiar with pool running.” He proceeded to describe types of pool running exercises, and while trying to explain one in particular, asked me if I was familiar with water polo. I replied, “No, but I know how to play Marco Polo.” Unfortunately, my childhood days of Marco Polo training proved insufficient…   Referring to pool running, the article states that, “… it looks a little odd.” Well, they were right. All 15 or so people at the pool, including the children trying to play around in the lane next to me, thought I was a complete whack-job. To give you a better idea of what pool running looks like, think of a common dream you might have had or heard of - you know, the one where someone is chasing you and you're running but not going anywhere? It's like that, but add to your mental picture: 8 lanes of professional swimmers, 1 lane of 3 kids trying not to stare, a swim cap, goggles, and Melissa Bourgeois trying to “run” to the other end of the pool without drowning. That's pool running.   Although I looked like a total ass in the pool, I felt great afterwards, much unlike I feel today. It seems I have either mild food poisoning or a stomach virus – either way, I can't even think of food without wanting to vomit. Suffice it to say I will not make my 6 mile long run today, which I am very disappointed about. It's only going to make my 7 miler next week that much harder. I'm trying to get as much rest as possible today so I can try to make up the long run tomorrow. We'll see.

It always takes Monty at least 20 mintues to find the perfect patch of grass to excrete his waste matter upon. This is because he knows the very second that last tappering chunk hits the ground he will be whiplashed across the lawn back up into the apartment (well, ok, a slight pause as my bagged hand scoops up his hot, steaming pile). Anyway, last night, he was really taking his time. It had been 35 minutes and we had yet to find the night's sanctuary of defecation. Just as I was about to give up all hope and line the livingroom with newspaper and Bush campaign posters, he popped a squat.

I avoid eating before bed as well. Wondering if anyone else has this experience. I was maybe thinking of moving it to type evening but then I’m worried if there’s some 12 hour delay to it I’m just gunna wake up with the nausea which could be just as bad but at least it won’t effect my sleep.

0,"It was Gavin and Janie's wedding last weekend and Rory came over on Wednesday evening in preparation. We spent Thursday afternoon trailing around Leeds trying to buy trousers because he claimed his current ones were too shiny for Best Man purposes. � 70 later and he forgot to wear them on the day. I also had purposes in Leeds as I had agreed to speak to a woman from Radio 4 about my experiences with depression. We got in touch with each other through a poster in SHIP asking for people willing to talk about themselves and their problems. The lady was sensible, sympathetic, informed and, most importantly, Taking A Sensible Approach. It was a far better experience than my time talking to Kerrang! Radio. Anyway, my contribution will be part of a show about depression called Is It Normal?, one of a series of four half hour shows to be aired around August looking at a variety of health issues and the normalcy or lack-thereof of each of them. The evening's journey to Southport was described as turgid. The cumulative train journey time was two and half hours, but there was a half hour break in Manchester where we raided Sainsbury's for biscuits as well. There was a reasonable amount of wildlife to be seen from the windows - I spotted two foxes, three rabbits and incalculable numbers of horses, cows and sheep. We didn't get to our hotel until after 10pm, by which time we were too tired to care about the shabbiness of our surroundings. The bathroom had mould, there was sheets not a duvet (and a woolen blanket, which, of course, I'm allergic to), one thin pillow each, dirty windows and the hotel bar closed at 11pm. I drowned my sorrows in bourbon. The biscuits that is, not the drink. Friday started grey and windy but by lunchtime the weather had cleared up and it was a beautiful, sunny day. The trip to the golf course where the wedding was taking place (don't ask) took us through pretty roads with old houses and woods. We were some of the last to arrive which was quite good as there wasn't too much time to worry about the logistics or any problems which might be about to arise. The service was quite quick, civil ceremonies usually are. The room was decked with flowers and all the men were wearing purple flowers. Janie was wearing a purple suit and Gavin was in a coordinating shirt and tie. The photographs were taken outside near the putting green but we didn't get too many strange looks: I believe weddings are quite common there. Everyone lazed around for a while before we were called in to eat. I had been told that the club had said they were more than happy to ensure I had vegan food, so I was some what taken back when they presented me something very similar to lasagna, slathered in what was clearly bechamel sauce. Then they tried to tell me it had vegetarian cheese in it. We managed to reach a compromise of being cooked vegetables in sweet and sour sauce, which turned out to be far more appetizing than I was anticipating. For dessert they tried to feed me fruit salad. My idea of fruit salad is obviously far removed from theirs however, as my glass featured some black grapes (edible), a few slices of apple (inedible), some pineapple (ditto), some melon balls (acceptable but I had melon for a starter, and that had been unripe), some orange slices (don't get me started on oranges) and a few pieces of unidentifiable fruit. Where was the raspberries and strawberries? The banana, plum, Granny Smiths, green grapes? Wasn't impressed. Later, I was practically forced by Rory to eat some chocolate coated cake (""They cost �5 each! You need to eat it!"") so on top of my own guilt, the lady who seemed to be coordinating all the food had the gall to try and tell me off for eating something which obviously wasn't vegan. What business was it of hers? We left early on Saturday morning, or what I perceive as early, at least. I wanted to stop off in Manchester to leave some posters advertising the Ladyfest All Dayer, but Rory refused, saying that he was too tired and his bags were too heavy. So we came straight home and I spent the afternoon sleeping. Afterwards we had pizza and discussed my weight problems. The solution was decided on to be no more pizza. And no more many things. I got weighed and it's far worse than I thought. We discussed the possibility of Slim Fast and diet pills, and my mum's offer of paying for liposuction. We agreed I should keep a food diary, stick to my exercise plan, cut back drastically on my calorie intake and if that doesn't make a successful impact, then to try the pills and Slim Fast, though I'd rather not have to eat that, it being full of milk. My mum said if I lose the weight I want to first then she'll pay for the remaining lumpy bits to be removed as a birthday present. Now I just need some self control again. On Monday we went to the end of year show at college. There was some wonderful things, though it seems that there have been less good exhibits every year since I started going. Are the students getting worse? Am I starting to be more critical of art? Or a combination? Rory went home afterwards and I was left alone again. Left to my food diary and my shit book (I'll Go To Bed At Noon - how it got short listed for the Booker I have no idea) and my self loathing. Bleugh. Two weeks to more hugs. Finally, it seems Jo Brand is wanting song suggestions for a compilation called Music to Drain Radiators To. Naturally... ",sarah_e_2_b_1_uk.txt

My 21st birthday was this weekend and I got pretty drunk and started to think about it and I just cried and cried in the Uber with my friends. I’m really thankful for them.

It’s awesome but has issues of its own because I tend to make poor choices, act conceited/rude without realizing it, and sometimes get angry. I was on Zoloft for a short time (age 11-12) and it made me a little less depressed but caused me to do horrible things impulsively, act spoiled and stuck up, and have frequent fits of rage. I attempted suicide within the first month of taking meds. I developed anorexia, made poor sexual and financial decisions, and was fired from my Saturday job as a babysitter because I was yelling at the kids, teaching them how to swear and bragging about it to other teachers, and trying to flirt with the children’s fathers. At school I told everyone I had superpowers and raged at them when they said that my superpowers were not real. I had arguments with my parents and pulled out a knife to threaten them at one point. I had a boyfriend but was still flirting with other boys constantly including my teachers.

0,"I’m trying to get communication back with my best friend. I have an idea, it won’t be easy and it may never work, but it’s worth a shot? Long story short: I’ve been depressed and I have a friend. I could make a 5 paragraph story about my friend and my depression. But I want to get to the point. I don’t want to make this post too long otherwise no one will read it. My friend made the decision to stop communication with me until I go to a residential psychiatric program or somewhere similar. The thing is I’ve been in one already, it was a pretty flexible place, cell phones were allowed, doors were never locked, etc. Long story short I became “too high risk” and am not allowed back. And I don’t want to go back. I don’t believe in happiness by mental health, I believe in natural happiness. I believe that all humans deserve to feel happy without being told “your life sucks so you need pills and mental health treatment to be happy.” So anyways, I can’t fulfill his wish. But getting communication back with him is all I want. There are no exceptions. So here’s my idea. Just for fun I livestream games on YouTube. I do it for fun, not for fame, I don’t play those popular games, I play the ones that no one plays. It’s unlikely for a video to get more than 100 views. But I’ve considered starting a new channel. I will livestream games, post videos about my custom Guitar Hero songs (I do that for fun too) and just pretty much show that I’m having fun. But the big goal of the channel will be to “get my friend back”. That’ll be the whole idea. That will be written on every video. That’s what the channel art will say. Think of it as a gofundme, only I’m not asking for money, I’m asking for support from the public to hear my story, hear what I’m doing, and to be there with me when my friend does deliver. Here’s the catch. For obvious reasons, his name will never be revealed. No one will have any idea who my friend is. But little by little, I will try to reveal the channel to him. It’ll start with the channel being named “Ian”, then sooner or later add my last name. As time goes on I’ll try and find ways to give him clues about the channel without actually telling him anything. The big dream is that he eventually discovers the channel, and with whatever support there is, he will see how much I’ve mentally improved over however long it takes. This all may sound totally silly, totally bogus, yeah, maybe this will never work in a million years. Just a wild thought that I’m going to attempt anyways. I might edit this post with a link to the channel depending on the response here. ",Titanic609.txt

0,"I wish I could have done things differently I graduated high school in June of 2015. Currently I am attending community college and have been doing fairly well so far although I don't know how long I can keep it up. Back in high school I didn't try as hard as I could have resulting in lower grades thus barring my chances of getting into a four year university. Freshmen year of high school I saw my lowest gpa ever I had gotten a 1.8 gpa in the 2nd semester of that year. Hell I was dumb enough in my freshman year to think that I could get away with cheating in my ceramics class but I ended up getting caught. If the university applications saw that I got a D in an art class they would have thought I was a full on retard for trying to apply to a university. It was because of my second semester of freshmen year that I thought my chances of a four year were impossible. I also never bothered to do the ACT/SAT because I thought that with my low gpa it wouldn't have mattered anyway. The following years in hs I've managed to improve a bit but not all that much. After high school ended I spent a year and a half not really knowing what I was doing taking a class at my community college here and there but not really committing, while also changing my major at least twice. If I play my cards right I'll be able to graduate by he end of May in 2019 and hopefully transfer to a university. But recently I can't help but think of how my life would have been if I had just went straight to a university after high school. I don't have any friends right now and I feel that if I had gone to university out of high school I would have had friends at this point. Right after high school I didn't really have any second thoughts and what I was doing. I was fine with going to community college and transferring later on but right now I can't help but feel that I've made a huge mistake. If only I had done better in freshmen year I probably would have gotten accepted into university and had a completely different life. I'm only 21 and I already feel like a huge goddamn retard for how I acted in my high school life. If i had taken things more seriously my life right now would have been a lot better. I feel like I have massively screwed myself. Most of the time now I think about what I could have done differently in high school and what my life would be like now.

1,"Too cowardice or just selfish? So English is not my first language so there might be some grammar mistakes but this has been bugging me for a while now. There was this girl I met some time during my last year of middle school and I guessed she took an interest in me, I was pretty confused as I wasn't the type to stand out much and I wouldn't talk at all unless someone comes up and starts a conversation with me. And she was the one to do that - uh, during a school graduation ceremony, of course. After that, we went to different high schools but still kept in touch. So overtime, after the graduation, we kind of became close, as friends. Well I didn't have many friends to start with so I spent a lot of time talking to her about all kind of stuff and I was devoted, if she was sad I would spend my day trying to cheer her up or yes, I wouldn't push her to say what was on her mind if she didn't want to share but yeah, I could do anything to make her happy because as I said before, I didn't have many friends, I was bullied and she was the first one to be so kind to me - all my ""friends"" kind of just sided with the bullies when they knew I was the target. At one point, I thought I was in love with her. But that was the part I would feel guilty whether it came up, I thought because she was the popular type, and she had a boyfriend, dating her was something I could never do. But then she broke up with her boyfriend (it was some kind of argument over some disagreements iirc), I was happy about it but it just wasn't the right time, she was sad and she would spent the whole summer the following year after we met just talking with me about stuff and as we could do some drawings, we kind of made a world of our own and we would stay up until 2 in the morning everyday just to think of a concept for that universe (it's like making a comic or something, I'm a big nerd for world concepts) so it was like I was bonded with her. Anyways I think I'm being too informative about this so I'll just skip to the main point. After that, about 6 months or so I tried to be an understanding friend and I didn't take a single opportunity to try to flirt with her as I knew I would be a dick if I had done that - well because I thought I shouldn't pressure her into a relationship whereas she just got out of one. So anyways, after a year, she got over it, I thought it was the right time for me but I didn't have the confidence to confess because I was overprotective of her as she didn't/doesn't have a good family and I was more like a big brother to her, because she was the one who wasn't good with dealing problems and I've lived my whole life dealing with all kinds of problems so I had a good view of dealing with them (I won't go into details as it would be another really long story) - So the idea of us dating was kind of ridiculous - I still don't know if she ever felt the same way. So I tried to change for the better, I went out to socialize more (it was exhausting but hey, there are things you would do for love), I worked out to lose weight so she doesn't feel embarrassed if we were to get together (she doesn't say it but I know she doesn't even want to date a fat guy) - I wanted to be a good partner for her, I know I wouldn't be the best but I could try. I tried to be someone reliable because I know full well she kind of looked down on me, how she tried to prove that she's better than me at everything (she is, at some fields). But the distressing part was that she started changing, she is still popular (yup, up until now), but she had more outbursts, she was constantly crying and whether I came up to ask her what was wrong she would throw a fit at me so I thought I was invading her privacy too much so I didn't say anything anymore, I was just there, trying to be supportive. So for the second time, I let go of another opportunity for a girlfriend. (you can actually skip the first two parts but I just felt like going into details, sorry) The third time, I thought it was time to make a move and she met a girl and fell in love with her instantly, I was supportive of her regardless. The latter one was also attracted to her so I thought just what kind of person would be so selfish to stop their bestfriend from getting in another relationship. I mean, honestly, I never had any luck with girls so I could just wait for later, her being happy was my priority. Yeah, so ever since I tried to change, I was better at talking. So I helped them get together, how to reply just to get the other one to be her girlfriend. And after that, our friendship was getting better. I thought I was the happiest person at the time, but another part of me was devastated. That part was well hidden for quite some time but it grew, it hated her girlfriend, it hated the fact that I was being too devoted and never got anything in return (I didn't quite expect anything in return from the start but I guess my feelings piled up). And before I knew it, I was being a control freak, I hated the other one not out of jealousy, but rather because she brought her down - her girlfriend was suicidal, she kept saying how she wanted to die - well I could careless about that because I knew lovers don't like bestfriends. That is, until she started saying how she wanted to die, she was constantly whining, crying and whether I asked her she just said nothing was wrong and kept on doing so. And whether I tried to talk some sense into her she just replied with a single ""Ok."" and it was bugging me. And she spent most of her time talking to her girlfriend and kinda just went anywhere with her, I never knew what was going on in her life anymore at this point. Now I'm not that small to start hating her for that, I let it slide anyways, though it bugged the hell out of me. So as you all know how important your last year of highschool is, she kind of just felt so down she lost a great deal of weight but it's kinda weird how I started to careless about details, about her too, of course, guessing because I was let down so many times. But anyways, my feelings for her started to fade, but regardless, I still tried to cheer her up, pushing her to study but she gave me the cold shoulders and even got mad at me for ""interfering"" with her life. And ever since we talked less. Then lately I don't know what is wrong with me but I just started feeling hatred for her. I didn't even blame myself for that. I just...Hated her. But for some reasons, I can't quite tell her and I don't even know why, why our distance grew and why I loved her and now I hate her. Is it strange? ",rabbitholeisgone.txt

And it can have the side effect of weight loss (not a bad thing for me ) I was on it for ten years at a time and got to the stage where when I came off it and had a period again I had completely forgotten what they were really like! And things have wings now. The PMS didn't cause my depression but it certainly didn't help it. Hope this is helpful ",grufflepuss_e_2_b_1_uk.txt
1,"After 2 days in a row of getting my son on the school bus late, I realize something. The alarm clock in the bedroom is 30 minutes off from regular time! 30 minutes late.And who would do something so phenonimally stupid? My husband would. See...he works nights. So he gets up in the afternoon. But does he tell me he's done this to MY clock? NO. When I call him to ask him if he did this(which I already know he did)does he apologize? NO. He never apologizes. My angry response negates an apology. See...things are always about him. Screw what the rest of us need. He set that clock to HIS work time. Never mind that he never needs it to wake up.

0,I have a bad personality that appears good. My personality is a result of childhood abuse and depression. I was treated like a subordinate not worthy of shit growing up and now as an adult I'm a people pleaser to the extent of ruining my own life to help others even if they dont need it because I worry about my reputation and want people to constantly think I'm a really good person. I know that it isn't good behaviour but I don't know how to be outside of that. It feels nice to get praised for it but I really want to start accomplishing things for myself and let people handle their own business. I want to be someone. I don't even feel like a person half the time. There are too many ways to be and I don't know which one is a good fit for me. It's definitely not this. I'm not really sure what to do and I'm sure no one could really answer this for me but I really wanted to get it off my chest. Idk if anyone else is like this but it sucks. I was doing some research and found martyr syndrome and it really kicked me off my pedalstool and I feel like a piece of shit that sets too high standards and takes too much responsibility on and makes people feel bad. I thought I was just a super nice person but I'm actually an asshole victimizing myself constantly and blaming it on others. TL;DR: I have a bad personality and I want to find a new one that is better. ,hoochiellama.txt
0,"Finding it difficult after college Hi. Im 23 and lately I've lost interest in everything. It kinda started last semester, I finished my masters and missed out on a 1.1 from a bad assignment, can't find any jobs relating to my degree and am currently stuck in a miserable retail job. Since the new year started everything has been getting tougher. I've been applying for PhDs, science jobs and anything that i could use my degree for, and everything Ive applied for I've been rejected from. My supervisor I was applying for scholarships with has kinda just abandoned me because I was declined from a competitive scholarship he wanted his project funded for. I feel like everything relates back that I narrowly missed out on my top grade so I'm basically an idiot. Since then I'm in a retail job where I get shouted at by customers every day. My roommate and best friend landed me saying she was leaving our apartment and ringing the landlord-literally out of nowhere-, so I've to leave the city and move back home. I've been prescribed antidepressants before but I found that they made me feel worse and I couldn't stay on them. I feel like I'm just stuck in a rut and I'll never get out. All my friends are either in phds or jobs that they like and I'm the only one in a miserable job. I've applied for another masters, the one I initially wanted before I got accepted into the one I degreed in, but I feel like it's just a waste of time. I have a family that loves me and a boyfriend and a few good friends I know care but I just find myself thinking that theyd be happier if I wasn't around. Everything I've tried to do has just been a failure and I've just lost interest in life. Some days I really don't want to leave my bed and just lie there because I'm just going to fail again. Sorry for the rant. TL:DR: finding myself in a rut I just can't get out of and have lost interest in life ",biffybeefa.txt
0,"Doing things that I like reminds me why I don't enjoy doing them anymore. Playing your favorite game? You shouldn't. Remember the time you shut yourself in just to play it endlessly? When nothing else mattered but your game? Finished reading a cool book? Are you going to pick up another one and get sucked in again? Don't forget your friends. Why would you hang out with your friends when they are tired of your negative attitude? Faking a positive attitude is worse. If you're going to be yourself just stay home. Oh you got selected for a great job opportunity? Wait until they realize you're garbage at your job. You have time to relax now? Think again. There's always someone needing something or things that need to be done. Trying to treat yourself? Wait until you see the consequences from buying too many things or eating too much or wasting time. You're actually being responsible and starting work early? Wait until you feel like nothing is worth it anymore. Why does it matter to do things you like if you're just going to feel bad anyways?

0,"I suffer from major depression too and I have taken almost all of the SSRI's but the only one that really helped me was Lexapro. I took it for around 2 month's, then decided that I didn't want to become addicted to another medication so I just stopped taking it and it didn't bother me at all. I have been taking 100 mil of Elavil at bedtime which is also an antidepressant but I take it to help me sleep. It used to help control my depression but it doesn't anymore and really doesn't help me sleep either. Have you ever tried Lexapro? I think it's the best SSRI one can be on and I had no side effects while taking it so you might want to ask your doctor about it. If there is an alternative treatment for major depression I would like to know what it is. I really have no reason to be depressed as I have a very loving, supportive husband 4 wonderful children, 10 grandchildren and 6 great-grand children. Both my husband and I are retired and this is a time when I should really be enjoying my life but there is a void which I can't explain. I don't want for anything. I have a beautiful home, a new Durango but the material things aren't what makes one happy. I've been told that one chooses to be happy or unhappy but I certainly don't choose to be unhappy and I don't know anyone who would. I am a devout Christian and I know that my depression isn't coming from God but I'm letting the Devil tell me that I'm depressed. Maybe God is just trying to bring me closer to Him and I need to lay my burden of depression at His feet and tell him that I can't get through this alone, then just forget about it but for me it isn't that easy. Three of my 4 children are taking antidepressants so I guess depression might be hereditary (spelling?). I will pray for you to feel better and will you please pray for me too? Thank you.

0,"Glad I can help! Firelizardee has helped me a lot over on the effexor room (that's where most of my posts are). I've never really posted my story, but for what it's worth, here it is: I live in northern New York State where I grew up on the family farm. My brother and I run a feed/hardware/farm supply store. I've got a terrific wife and two daughters ages 1 and 3. My depression hit in January during a bout with the flu; my youngest daughter was hospitalized with febrile seizures and that might be what put me over the edge. My nervous breakdown seemed to come out of the blue, but I'd had an extremely stressful six months between job, illness, and adoption.  I'm also a hard driving firstborn perfectionist, and several family members have had alcoholism or suspected depression. So I guess depression should not have been so big a surprise, but it was. I'm a happy person with a great life! But I feel like I've been right to the edge of the precipice and looked down at Hell. Now I'm doing everything I can to ensure I don't relapse.....but I actually think I'm a better person having been through this. I'm much more appreciative of a 'good day' and I'm much more attuned to the suffering of others. It's amazing how many people I know have similar problems. And I hate that it has to be this way, but suffering does bring me closer to God. I hardly dare say that depression and anxiety was 'worth it'....the memory of the anguish is still too vivid, and besides, it could come back tomorrow. But right now, today, I feel more contented with my crazy, precious, stupid, dear, wasted, amazing life than I have been in years. I'm very lucky to have stumbled onto the right medication the first time, and to have a supportive family that didn't tell me to 'snap out of it'. And I'm very lucky to have the people here in this forum, who know what it's like. I hope, tvk, that in a few weeks you too will be a recovering depression survivor. Till then, we're here when you need us! ",dan_e_1_b_1_us.txt

0,"I think letters are a wonderful way to communicate. That way you don't say anything without thinking about it first. I wasn't clear if your mother actually read the letter or not. If she hasn't, I might suggest approaching the letter with just the first issue of the way she treats you (without the father issue) in one letter. That might open dialogue and allow you guys to focus on fixing that first. I understand your fear of authority figures. When I was that age (I'm 31 now) I couldn't talk to anyone of authority. My mom, who was shy herself had to do that kind of stuff for me. Could another one of your relatives go with you to take your drivers test? Nana or Sonny who you mentioned in the letter? If it helps to hear, I did get over my fear of authority figures and sometimes I go overboard and challenge them (to make up for lost time?). I never had psychotherapy, but I wish I had. So don't discount it, nip it in the bud if you are able to. One other question I have is...is your mother ALWAYS this way or does she show moments of tenderness, sympathy or interest in your life? I think that if you've seen the mom in her in the past, it sounds like she has some internal problems that she takes out on you, but have nothing to do with you. Don't worry about how you should be at this age...everyone has their own time clock inside. If we were all the same, this would be a very very boring world.

Thing is though, over the last 5 months, there's been a steep decline in conversation between myself, said friend and another friend.  Friend #2 and I have been making ALL the effort to make plans with friend #1 and we're getting almost nothing back.  We'll text her and we'll not hear anything for days, but she's on Facebook or snapchat posting pictures of her and her new boyfriend, and when she does text back, it's a totally one sided conversation. Like I'll ask her maybe ""how have you been"" and I;ll get a page of text about how she has been with BF and what they've been doing and at the end it'll be ""okay, I got to go, bye!"" If I don't specifically ask her about her baby (who I adore, she's like my niece) I don't hear about her, at all. It's all about BF. Recently, Friend #1 and I didn't see each other for just over 3 months! (did I mention she lives 20 minutes away from me?) No matter how many times I asked her over, offered to go to her house, offered to take her to coffee etc, either the invite went unacknowledged, or she wanted to spend the time with her BF. At that point, I was a bit annoyed but, I understood that people have lives and sometimes things just don't match up. However, the reason I'm looking for advice is because, after not seeing her for 3 months and talking to her only a handful of times, she hits me up and asks if I can watch her baby so she can go out with another friend. (who wasn't even going, she took her BF) I said yes, as I know how it is to want to go out and not to have a babysitter, so my husband and I watched baby over night for her. The ONLY thing I said to her was that I had plans the next day after 1 so I needed her to be back before then. (spoiler: she wasn't!) So I couldn't do my plans and asked friend #1 to stay and hangout since I hadn't seen her for so long. In the 1 hour(!) that she stayed, she called my sister (who I had plans with - we were meant to take my youngest out for his birthday, because friend hadn't come back yet, my sister took him out by herself) a freak!  She said 3 times ""imagine not waiting for you!"" I said to her, we'll it's because you weren't back and she blamed traffic for being 2 hours late... On top of the main incident, there's been an incident where she brought a stranger to my house (after I told her I didn't like strangers in my house or around my children) and expected me to be okay with it!  She dropped the bomb of bringing this stranger to my house 15 minutes before they arrived and told them I didn't want them there so they felt awkward! (I did try really hard to make them feel welcome, and thankfully the kids had plans so they weren't put in the situation) The advice I'm seeking is  - A. How do I talk to friend #1 about this without coming off as bitchy or upsetting her.  and B. Should I keep being friends with her?   I don't like to give up on a friendship, but I feel like she only wanted me around when she wanted something from me. Any advice is welcome, even if it's me being weird or whatever. Thanks guys.

1,"Feeling sad for my daughter/realizing grandparents won't live forever My husband and I had a child later in life. She's 18 months old and her grandparents on both sides are in their mid-late 60's. My parents are very healthy and I don't think of them as ""old"", so I mentioned that my daughter could live close to them if she chose to go to University in the city where they live. My mom chimed up and said that they may both be dead by then (for context, they're Chinese and it's completely normal for them to be this blunt with their children). I've had other family members pass away before, but it just hit me that no matter how you prepare yourself for that day, you'll never be ready to say goodbye. It's never enough time. I immediately felt very sad for my young daughter and just hope that we have lots of time left to bond and make memories. We live 5 hours away by car, so it's hard to see them as regularly as we'd like, but we try to visit and have them visit as often as we can. I just hope she gets to spend as much time as possible with them. ",sleepymommy925.txt

1,"My family is breaking apart (need help) So im a teenager aged only 14 , i live in Greece, my family was having issues, (my parents) started ~ 2015 and the real reason causing it was that my mother is working at my school as a cook , and a guy who finished his university ( i dont know what's called) of cooking  , he came to the school to work as head-chef , my father paranoia began at that time , he posted on facebook a post from my mother's profile tagging the cook and typing like this guy is my new boyfriend and stuff like that , my mother would never do that to my father, my father always had side-chicks beside her and he was being disloyal even at their marriage, also that head-chef was about 22 years old and my mother is 40-43 ... well lets go the main thing ! At 2017's March my mother's only brother (sibling in general) past away from heart disease and next month my father found this as distraction may i say to begin saying that my mother is a wh@re and is going to the school so the head-chef f@cks her.... its so sad guys that this guy left the work at school 3 months before that , he went to almost everyone he knew to characterize and judge my mother as a wh@re. Literally to everybody... well my mother shutted her mouth and stood back not resisting (i dont know how to describe it well) and actually let him come back to our house at approx. August , hm it went well shall i say for sometime but all of a sudden he left the house and went back to his paranoia .. he found a gypsy woman which he has relationship with now ( she is fat and ugly) , i managed to crack his facebook account and we ( me and my mom) got into his conversations with that ""lady"" and we found really smuttile stuff , there was things about v@brators and m@sturbating and really sad stuff in there .. my mother now has depression and she is so stressed (she considered suiciding actually) ... now that gypsy is controlling him and shes taking his money and she's trying to seduce him away from us , she's ridiculing him in public (cafes and other places).

Admittedly these are, yes, all online friends. I don't really have ""Realside"" friends any more. It's complicated. What I mean is- if I don't start a conversation, there will be no conversation. If there's a lull in the conversation, I've got to fill it or the conversation ends there. If I make plans with my friends (Usually to play a game, watch a movie, something like that) there's a 90% chance they'll forget, or just lose interest, or ignore it.

0,"Well I'm getting ready to go back to school so I'm trying to get sober for a while and see i can clear my head. So far I've been sober for about days and i must say I'm not feeling any better. Some of the problem is probably zyrtec which I'm taking for my allergies but really i just feel really irritable and confused. i can't really think too well and it's making me want to drink. Drinking slows down my mind somewhat so i can focus on things in my head. Normally its not till the next day after a good night of drinking that i feel good for most of the next day. i am more talkative and can come up with things much easier. There are people who use Prozac and other anti-depressant drugs not because they want it but because it makes them feel even better than they normally do. This is somewhat my issue with alcohol however i don't fell good normally i feel like s**t normally. i guess i should let u in on what is really bothering me. First ill just list the problems i have i find most worrying. Night blindness ""fuzzy vision"" bad sinus pressure moderate fatigue all the time short term memory problems random aches and pains major depression, anxiety, and ocd bad allergies acid reflux. To be honest most scary one is night blindness. Trying to explain is pretty difficult but ill try. It's like being able to see all the cons and rods and your eye flash on and off constantly kind of like a bad channel on a TV screen. I've had it for years now with no one who can really give me straight answer about it. i went to my doctor recently and got up the nerve to tell him but thought he gave me some good info he probably thought i was mad. Anyway one of the first things your body will do when it's over exerted is give u fuzzy vision. Now normally night blindness is caused be a vitamin A deficiency. Maybe there is something wrong with my stomach that is making me feel the way i am and i did have kidney stone when i was 2 which is very rare. i know this is a lot of information but this is what i deal with on a ""daily"" basis. My daily routine is almost exactly the same except on weekends when i do go out and drink with my friends. my will is low and energy just as low so i find myself kind of in and out of this trance that is supposed to be life. Each day i go to work, come home, eat, and up to my room for pretty much the rest of the night. don't get me wrong i do other things during the week sometimes but i feel most comfortable by myself in my room as opposed to human contact which sucks. So if i have to drink to keep from going over the deep end then i will do so until i get some real answers. If anyone has any answers I'm all ears. ",r3dhorse_e_1_a_1_xx.txt

0,"I've never liked myself. Honestly, I think that my entire life I've been depressed, but now that I'm older (19 y/o), I've realized what it actually is. All my life I remember hating myself and wishing I could be somebody else. I thought it was normal. I always envied just about everyone else and thought the worst about myself and every action I took. The only time I *ever* felt happy about myself was after a psilocybin mushroom trip. But that's besides the point. I've always hated myself but I was too naive to know what it was and I thought it was normal. Why can't I be normal? Edit: You know what, fuck this I'm gonna edit this.

1,"Dealing with a spiteful sister-in-law? I'm 28, and we are all living under the same roof. I live with my mom and dad, and help take care of my grandparents.. I have fibromyalgia, chronic pain, migraines 4-5 times a week and have trouble getting out of bed some days. Brother (loses jobs frequently, can never keep his wife happy) she's become a very spiteful and distant person in the last 2 years. They decided to move in March of 2016 after not getting their way of getting help from my mom (who helps everyone and is the kindest and most selfless person you will ever meet). They have 3 kids, and now a fourth one on the way in May. Brother ""Dave"" and his wife gonna call her ""Vick"". Always go back and forth at one another, as he loses jobs and they both work (she's held a stable job and he hasn't), calls him lazy, P.O.S., a horrible father, our family made her the way she is now, tells her kids to ""suck it or, or stop crying"" when they get upset or hurt. She used to be the sweetest, kindest person ever. I REALLY liked this woman, and we got along great. I could never say a bad thing about her 10 years ago. Until, I came out in 2008 as gay. She was supportive or so I thought. Then wrote a long nasty letter to me after telling my mom she didn't want me holding my boyfriends hand around her kids, that she didn't want that exposed to them, etc. I called her a hypocrite and walked off, because she did all these things with her husband and more. Nothing more, nothing less.  Cause she was and I was sick of all her bull about me and her hating on the way I was. I don't say things unless something truly bothers me and I was at the last straw. Said she didn't support me being gay, me being with my boyfriend was wrong, she doesn't want her kids around it, etc. Anyway, little bits of this kept coming up over the last 9 years and slowly grew distant from her. Last one me being worried about her being mad at me for something, as she came in and didn't talk  to me or respond to what I had said. I said is she mad at me? To my brother. He goes I don't think so. She then yells ""I'm not mad, STOP BEING SO DRAMATIC!"" I'm like wow.. completely out of character for her. I've never done anything to her to get spoken to like this.  1 year ago -- she called my brother a piece of sh*t for the 40th time. I got tired of it, her belittling him, throwing his things, telling him that our family are horrible people for the fights we get in once every 2 months. He looked defeated, he looked the saddest I've ever seen him. I asked what was wrong, he told me. I agreed with what he had said about her letting the children use the tablets too, that it was ridiculous that she's called him something so horrible over it. I was really angry at her, disappointed with her. We had gotten into a big fight after me coming out before as well and she denied everything that happened that day. I whipped out my phone for this one -- so all the facts were here. Everything was caught on camera for the minute we got into it. After I go into my room, she comes and slams the door next to my room closed and says, ""You've got to me f'ing kidding me. Is he really siding with you. HELL NO!"" to my brother. I come out and say what's the problem? (My mistake, but no... no one in my family has ever said anything to this woman to keep the peace. They're afraid of her taking the grandchildren away and my mom loves them dearly and is afraid of having a bad relationship with her.) I say ""I'm tired of you calling my brother a piece of crap."" I yelled, ""Stop treating him like that, what the hell is wrong with you? Who says that to the person they love and are married to? Why do you belittle him so much when he's finally got a nice job. I can't believe anyone in this house doesn't say anything to you over the way you treat him, specially around your kids. You say we're saying bad words in front of them and you guys and making you this way, analyze yourself."" She tells then to ""go back to your room, get a frigging job."" Then turns to my brother and says ""do something with your brother, go back to your room!""""I say no, you don't like what I have to say (and I speak for everyone in this house cause it's true). You can go."" This sparks her sister to message me -- telling me ""Never in my life have I been so disgusted with someone. Who do you think you are filming her!? The mother of your nephew and nieces raising your voice at her telling her to get out. I'm so disgusted, get the F' outta here!"" Brother wouldn't defend her after that happened. She went to my mom (who's like best friends with her) -- she didn't defend her. She then split with him for 8 months (this last August) that day. Now they're back together. Saying they're going to move and haven't. Ever since then, she's just been passive aggressive. Stands in the doorway and doesn't move when I need to get through. Is constantly rude when anyone says anything to her kids (when they're making a mess, yelling and telling adults to stop talking to them) unattended downstairs as she's on the couch upstairs. Telling my brother that I'm doing things when I haven't even spoken to this woman in months. I am so uncomfortable around her. I have said hi to her and things and have stopped, because it's a short ""hi"" and walks by. The last 6 months she's walked by me and hasn't said a word, no hi, no bye when she goes out the door. Walks by me or anyone in this house aside from my mom like we're not there. I know this sounds pathetic coming from a man who's 28, but I'm actually sick and am developing actual dislike and almost even hate for this woman. She hogs the washer and dryer, tells me to turn my animal light off when she's going to bed (cause it's out where she sleeps in the upstairs loft). Tells me to get all my stuff out of there when it was my storage space and now my room is packed with all my things out there. Tells everyone to keep it down. You go down the stairs too loud (passed her) she will ask who's there and make a big deal out of it. If anyone says anything to their daughters being rude to us, they both snap (yes my brother too) and call us rude, guilt trip us and say ""they're 5 and 9 years old, this is the way youre going to talk to a kid!?!, or they were just trying to make a sandwich as they're telling us to ""stop taking to me or telling me what to do, you're not my mom or dad"" etc. Is it bad that I want them all to move? I'm in my room most days when they're. I feel so trapped here, and I don't know what to do. I have no choice but to stay here until I find a job for people like me with chronic health issues - and they're never going to move because they constantly mooch off my mother.  She pays for their car accidents, their bills, their car rentals, their groceries, dinner, gives them money to go on dates and gas to go drive to work (even though they make their own money), etc.  My mom is starting to sort of agree she even wants them to move, and she won't step up and say anything to anyone. I tell her to or else I will. She goes ""NO DON'T!"" She's so afraid of these people -- and losing her grandkids. I don't know what to do. ",tripleh3lix25.txt

0,"My Fictional Home I stared outside, and watched the cold atmosphere awake me. The sun’s rays blocked by the magnificent beauty above us all; an urban scape filling my view around me. I felt a grave sadness strike all in the same spots for my daily routine, crippling what was left of my head. I grabbed the bicycle, and went along the path to any good in my life. ‘A nearly missed accident up ahead,’ I reminded myself. I hit the button to change colors, and awaited a stop that could mean a sour tardiness or a decent morning. The color changed fast, and I hastily sped across the lines between me and the other side. I arrived, striking the pavement at full speed ahead down the rubber sidewalk. A straight path to follow, a new future to envelop soon enough. The fact of the matter was that I had to pray to a god I didn’t believe in if I wanted to warp my happy spirit to glorious utopia. Logic overrides hearts quite rarely, leaving a snowflake and a shock of noise behind the mind that just wants it all to change. My bored mind only somewhat consciously bobbed his head around from side to side, keeping an eye on the reflective sign for a change of heart. The observant man coming by on a bicycle or on his own two legs could notice the hurting expression that shone on my face. An insomnia that has outlasted its course, half a heart to spare to the one it belongs to, and the tonnes lying on his stubby shoulders. Whether the man is out to care for their dog, the mail, something; they always take a look to glance at the face of a broken child, often not realizing the fine details in the street lights glowing on my frozen cheeks. ‘What did it take to find redemption?’ I often wondered, as grand sunlight was walking upstairs to knock the moon off it’s sleepy stool. I sat and watched a beautiful red giant approach, and drew images in mind to flicker about and echo in my concave dome of secrets. As the flickering opportunity ran full speed in front of me, I turned and felt the imagery toss into the incinerator. A great insecurity washed over the industry working ahead up above, slowing me down as I walked in slowly toward the place to call work. I sat the bicycle at it’s rack, hands in pocket as I blinked at the glaring sun. A numbness hit my heart, and for the next eight hours, I’d lose who I was, only coming back at the rise of a pounding rain. I walked from a distant building, taking the long path to a home that didn’t know me. I took the rugged bicycle, and stared up above at the shadowy clouds. I leaned forward over the handlebars, watching the patterns fly past my visions. I lifted up again, opening my voice to play a tune, looking for a face to redeem my little work. I went onward, and stared at the home that forgot me. I walked slowly up, placing the bicycle just where it was, hitting the kickstand which had sacrificed my ankle some. I opened the door, giving a brief greeting. I entered the meeting room of regrets and lost innocence, stroking my hands over what was a cuddly friend. My vision blurred, feeling the great exhaustion from the night prior taking me over. I curled in the corner, feeling the toilets flushing the pent up pains from an earlier disembarkment of a peanut gallery. I hugged the one thing that brought a soothing to my life, and proceeded to let out an ugly sob, trying to remember who everyone was, as I grabbed a broken mirror, staring at who the blurry stranger was in it. I felt myself faint, awaking to two strangers cycling the door between storage and the hands of all waiting for me. “What were you thinking?” the woman asked, “What did you say?” the man asking. “I don’t know.” I responded, lying on my side, as they both awkwardly stepped out, with a cracked expression of what was me walking out. I felt a blankness ride across my body, as I stared upon a wall that reminded me of life. I sat stationary, and buried my head under a recording of a person with nothing left. I held my heart, staring out at the dark that I wanted to escape in. A length that no person dared, but a low that felt necessary. I felt an unnecessary realism flow through me, as my arms folded, feeling a coldness drip down my neck. I got up, and went to the porch of attempting life again. A moon vanished above me, showing a pine away from me only just by some measurements. The bicycle appeared broken on the road, as I walked to what I remember being the last resort in this world. I walked to a reused bench, and stared out at the murky waters that felt like memories. I looked to my left, seeing a young boy sitting in the back of a delinquent’s wagon, and to my right a child amongst a smaller group, enjoying the finer delicacies of life. In between it all, a fool. I cracked my bubbly back, as a soreness hit my veins. I stood slowly, my body tossing and turning inside. The world turned askew, as the sun beat slowly onto my flustered body. I took flight across the ramp of a broken dream, taking a flip that would ruin me for a day. A nostalgia for the life that was simple broke me down slowly, as I felt my walking slow down. I sat by a curb, watching a teenager go away from a regretful sunset on a bench. He sported a terrible frown, forgetting of the one. A light flew by at fast speeds, turning away from my stretched out legs, as a noise emitted from it’s front. I stared blankly into the street, feeling my mind shatter into many jagged pieces. A dam blocked the feeling of humanity and a progress of going up in the world. I picked up the pieces, attaching them to my hurting consciousness. I stomped back to a filthy bed, staring into the bright light that fueled no purpose. I spread a message, the bait missing all parties. I collapsed, waking to a time of no reply. I logged into what made time fly by, and felt the pains of months wash away within seconds. A second half had joined, and I forgot about all the things around me for the next year. Dawn upon myself shined my sleepy public works to let out a shrieking cry, standing over a bin full of scraps and desperation to fix my bleeding innards. I panicked into a corner, awaiting life’s worst terrors. I stood to nothing, and returned to a hamper of depression. I stared at the dusty fan blades fly full speed, breathing in only to glance at the horrid truth. A shadow stood behind my forgotten figure, taunting the fullness above it. I wore a jacket and yelled at it, and it shyly walked. I took a deep breath and walked outside toward the bench once again, staring out at the beautiful waters. A creature came from the waters, approaching me. I held its hand, standing up accordingly. The creature pushed me into a pit full of spikes, as I awoke to half of me missing. I felt a burning inside of me, as my insides waned into a fine drawing of genitalia, washing the deliberate feeling and thought around my head, causing me to let out of a horrific screech of losing a natural ability. My body awoke in a new person’s home, as I stared out into the busy road below my sleepy figure. An old woman came out from the corner, as I nervously responded with a gulp. We shared an exchange, as I sat and pondered the shelves of a life that I knew little about. I explored the past, only finding multiple recordings of enthusiasts. I folded my hands, recognizing that I meant nothing here. The plane flew slowly away, as the shock went away from my skull, as my heart was left with a small hole. I sat and could not breathe, only feeling a great pain as we jumped into the chair of obnoxious actions. I sat and thought, glancing at the broken mirror. It was me. ",who_i_was.txt
1,"Super Smash Bros. Melee is my most favorite game in the world. It is a four-player fighting game that has super simple moves compared to other fighting games. However, don't think that it is an easy game to beat and no fun to play. You still must master moves for a character just like you would for any other fighting game. You have to know when to sidestep dodge, jump, and attack your opponent. You have to know when to roll behind and when to retreat. Only true master can beat Giga Bowser and the Master and Crazy hand!  Not only do you have to beat Classic, Adventure, and All-Star mode, you also have to beat all the event matches and get all 290 trophies! This is a must have for any Gamecube owner, and that means YOU! Buy it now! I am saying this out of my own love towards the game, and I am not a walking advertiser :)  Recently, there was a Melee Tournament in our area, and out of two and a half pages worth of people, guess who came out first...ME! I got hoards of stuff! I love being the best at Melee! Surprisingly, they never got me down to one life! It consisted of many three life stock battles. I brought my memory card and they let me use it because they had NO characters. I have 100 percent beaten that game.  Also, I have kept a profile name. It has over 1000 wins and around fifty losses. No, I play my brothers and Level 9 CPUs. I stopped the playing timer at 9,999:59! That's around 163 hours, and I know that I played more than that! I am a freak of this game and have emailed Nintendo multiple times on when the next Super Smash will come, but they said there has been none announced. If you know PLEASE TELL ME. I hope the DS will have the game. Just think... PORTABLE SUPER SMASH!!!  If you think you can beat me in Melee, I think I can beat you. You may not be easy, but I'm trying to become the best in the world! Come talk to me If YOU LOVE SUPER SMASH BROS. MELEE!!!!  I also have the original Super Smash Bros., but I think it's nothing compared to Melee. All you have to do in that game is throw. It's fake, but I still like it. You can talk to me about that too.

1,"I want to fix my best friend and I's friendship, but I'm not sure if I should... any advice? Hi! I'll try to make this as short as possible, but you can ask me for more details if you want to. My best friend (19/f) and I (19/f) met two years ago. We're polar opposites, but we somehow became very close, and eventually started calling each other best friends (and other nicknames haha). It was awesome, and she's the only person I feel that close with -- she's like family (though I never told her that). Back in July though, I was feeling very drained. My best friend deals with severe depression and I was helping her a lot through it, willingly so. Honestly I felt fine for a year but I've been going through a huge identity crisis, trying to find myself and trying to know myself. I felt so confused and lost with myself -- I didn't know what I wanted anymore. It was bad. It was very exhausting for me mentally but I thought the cause of how I felt was my best friend. You might ask why I thought that, well, whenever we'd hang out, I'd have to go out of my house. I'm an introvert, and I deal with a lot of anxiety, I always feel uncomfortable being outside. But considering I'd only go outside to hang out with my best friend, I thought *she* was the problem. I took me a while but I eventually decided, even though I didn't really want to, to end the friendship. I thought this would make me feel better, like it was the key to my happiness or something. After I overcame the ugly crying phase that lasted for a week after I ended the friendship, I was feeling really good... for only a week. It was a sense of freedom like ""I don't have to worry about anything anymore!!"". I started missing her real bad though. But I thought, hey, maybe I just miss the IDEA of her, and not really HER. So I waited to see if my feelings would change over time. Back in september, uni started. We shared the same classes. We saw each other again and I thought it was a good opportunity to talk to her again and explain some things out, and especially apologize to her (we had a bad argument when I told her I was ending the friendship), and she apologized too. She was really excited because some of her guy friends were with her at uni and she wanted me to hang out with them. I was still questioning a lot of things about myself at this point, and I was terribly anxious about starting uni, and also because I was scared her friends wouldn't like me or think I'm too ""innocent"" or whatever. So I chickened out and decided to avoid her. Two days later, I dropped out of uni (not because of her), and didn't say a word. I was feeling ashamed about dropping out and I had issues at home that made me feel really depressed, so I isolated myself BAD. I pushed all of my friends away, and eventually ended up alone, well, I still had some internet friends, but they didn't last long because I ended up ignoring everyone's messages. Fast forward to now. I still miss my best friend terribly. Some days are worse than others. I thought I'd be over it by now but I always end up crying at night because I just want to talk to her and hang out like we used to. I tried to distract myself as much as I could, and I tried to make new friends, but every time, I ended up realizing that I was just trying to find someone to replace her, which obviously didn't work out. I realized that I talk about her everyday still to my parents. My mom actually asked me how she was doing and I had to remind her that we're no longer best friends. I still think very fondly of my best friend so when I talk about her, or think about her, it's like nothing happened. I dream about her too sometimes. I want to contact her again. I want to explain to her everything I was feeling and tell her I want us to be friends again. But I'm scared. It looks like she's completely moved on from me, and she has this new (guy) friend and they seem really close. It makes me sad because I feel like I've been replaced and I won't be able to be her best friend again. I want to be here for her, laugh with her, cry with her, hang out with her, be by her side during the best and worst moments. I don't want to be with anyone else. Just her. I can't blame her for finding new friends and moving on, also her new friend seems like a really great guy, I actually think I'd get along with him. But I don't know, it still makes me feel sad. It makes me feel like I shouldn't contact her because she doesn't need me in her life anymore and she forgot about me. I'm aware this is probably the case though. I've been thinking of making an audio where I just talk about what's on my mind and talk about our friendship and send it to her. I'm so scared though. Is this a good idea or should I just drop it? It really makes me feel sad and I'm crying way too much over this -- I feel like, even if we can't be friends again, I need some closure. I didn't tell her everything when I ended the friendship, I only told her something like ""we don't click anymore"", I'm not even sure because it was a lie. I didn't want to hurt her feelings by saying her depression was hard for me to deal with because I also had my issues. I don't know. Sorry I'm kind of a mess haha, I hope you can still understand what I'm saying. Also -- if you think I should do the audio thing -- do you have any advice on what to say and what not to say? I'd really appreciate it. **TL;DR: I ended our friendship of two years because I was going through an identity crisis and she was dealing with severe depression and it made me feel terribly drained. I regret it though and I've been missing her so much but I don't know how to contact her again as she's got a new close friend and seems to have moved on. I've been thinking about making an audio for her where I talk about our friendship and what's on my mind but I'm not sure if this is a good idea. Should I just drop it or still give it a shot? I deeply miss her and I can't seem to get over her no matter how hard I try to. Also -- if you think I should do the audio thing -- do you have any advice on what to say and what not to say? I'd really appreciate it.** ",smoofsmooff.txt

0,"I posted here sometime in December I think. I was having tons of digestive problems, well it's been about 4 months now and I'm still having them, but now I also feel extremely fatigued all the time too, I've had test after test and seen doctor after doctor, everything comes back negative. I was actually put on Zoloft for about a month but taken off of it to try other things b/c that wasn't doing the trick either. I'm back to thinking that it's all in my head, I'm now on b12 shots but those aren't doing anything either. I feel like a zombie, I have zero energy and zero motivation to do anything. Even the simplest task like styling my hair seems like a huge chore that I just want to put off. All I want to do is sleep all day. One thing I've noticed is that man do I ever waste time, I mean I literally do nothing but waste time most of the day. I only have about two hours of class per day and no job so I have tons of free time to waste away. I analyzed what I did in the past hour and it basically went like this: The entire time I was talking to myself non-stop, analyzing things, analyzing my situation, thinking of motivational quotes etc.... I tend to do that all day. For about 15 minutes I stood around leaning against a wall, the next 15 minutes i leaned against the television, then I went and lied down for a while all while still thinking and analyzing things in my head, then I came on the computer to just look at random, pointless things. And that is pretty much how most of my time is spent, I might spend an hour or so just standing around or sitting doing nothing but thinking or daydreaming, that can't possibly be healthy and I obviously have way too much free time, I'm just not sure if this is what is in turn causing all my fatigue and sickness. Have I become so addicted to this lifestyle that my mind will purposely make me feel sick so I have an excuse to live like this? ",killingtime_e_2_a_1_xx.txt
0,"I don't know what my problem is Hello, I've never posted here before. I'm a 28 year old guy and have a decent job that I like, it's quiet and involves a lot of puzzle solving and I'm pretty good at it. I've never had a ton of friends because I'm very particular and not very open with people so it takes a long time to build up relationships, but the friends I do have are outstanding and I wouldn't trade them for anything. I'm kind of the funny guy but my humor is very blue. I got bullied a lot in grade school and learned to make people laugh because it'd get them to not make fun of me. I think it just kind of stuck. I don't know if any of that information is really important, just wanted to give it in case that's something that people do here. For at least 5 years, I have a hard time doing anything outside of my job alone without crawling up inside my head. All the things that I used to do for enjoyment like listening to music or playing video games, I just can't do anything anymore. It's like a wave of apathy that very rarely lifts. Occasionally, I pick up a razor blade and will press it into my shoulder or hand and I don't really know why to be honest. I don't know if I like the pain or maybe I like having something else to focus on for a minute. Or just to feel something that isn't apathy for a moment. I think about dying sometimes. Why we're here, what's the point if it ends the same. I doubt I'd ever kill myself because there are things I care about here that I wouldn't leave behind like that, mainly my mom and brother. I worry my brother will end up like me. Is there anything I can do? I don't know what a pill could do for me or if a pill works. I think the brain is so complex that it couldn't, but I guess I don't know. I don't want to be in a mental fog or be unaware or not be me anymore. I've also always kind of thought that it's human nature to feel this way: that everybody gets down, gets bored, thinks about their mortality, etc. and that I'm just being soft and need to suck it up. Life is difficult, I just need to learn to deal with it maybe. I don't know what's going on but I don't like feeling like that. If I'm hanging out with friends or family I'm usually fine, it's being alone with myself and having time alone where I can't entertain myself and waste away. I can't really explain it. Does anyone else feel like this? What helps you? I've never talked to a therapist or anything like that and understand you cannot give a diagnosis on here, but if you know any methods to help me get out of that feeling, I'd be eternally grateful. Is this what depression feels like and I've just been in denial about having it for years? ",GalacticRhinoceros.txt
0,"I have a gripe about pharmaceutical and insurance companies.  You can take up to 450 mg / day of Wellbutrin XL.  The manufacturer makes 150 mg and 300 mg pills, but not a 450 mg pill.  OK, so just take 3 of the 150's, right?  Well if the doctor prescribes it that way, at least one insurance company won't pay for it.  The doctor has to prescribe it as one 300 mg pill plus one 150 mg pill - thereby making the patient have to pay 2 co - payments for what should be one prescription. Why doesn't the manufacturer make a 450 mg pill?  And how can the insurance companies get away with forcing doctors to prescribe in what is really a stupid manner?

That's when i discovered cutting myself. It started off as what does it feel like then grew into and addiction. I used to be doing it nearly everyday. IT made/makes me feel like there's nothing wrong. Well this grew bigger and bigger and i didn't tell anyone about it. After about 8 months i started to lie to myself and say everything was fine, It worked. Only temporarily. Around 3 months ago the feelings came back and i still have them at this moment. I have researched a lot about clinical depression. I still cut and i hate it. I came right out to my parents and said ''Maybe i enjoy cutting myself"" when we were in a huge fight. My dad turned around and said ""we don't care if you cut yourself"". This definitely didn't help. So right now i have one person i can talk to about it and has a good friend of mine.

1,"Friend Abandonment Issues Hey Reddit. Im having some friend issues. I(M33) have a friend(M34) who I was close with for years who now seems to abandoning me. We met each other 10 years ago. We hit it off and would casually hang out with eachother. He was new to the city so I ushered him into the fold of my friend group.We both had similar tastes and sense of humor. It would work out good and we would have a great time. After a couple years he totally cut off contact with me and those friends. I was confused but didn't mind so much then because I wasn't super close with him. I was confused but not hurt. A couple years after that I reached out to a bunch of people because I needed help moving. I was pretty desperate and couldn't afford movers so I reached out to him as well. To my surprise he responded and came and helped. I was so happy he offered to help and was happy to see him again. After that, we started hanging out again. I asked him what happened and why he broke off contact and he shared with me things about being depressed and hanging out with other people. It felt I little strange but I accepted it and carried on being his friend again. We both moved to a 'big city' through our jobs and work and would meet lots of different people and introduce each other to new friends. We would periodically check in with each other and see how each other are doing, even if we couldn't hang out for weeks on end. We were in a band for a while, threw parties and events. We both went through break ups with our long time partners at different times, and helped each other out in that regard. We basically became 'close friends' and expressed this to each other. Then I introduced him to a group of old friends of mine who recently moved into the city. They all began to hang out with him and it was all good. He even hooked up with one of those friends and have been together for years. I too found a partner I have been with for a a couple years now. Now, over the past couple years he has began to hang out with all of those friends and much less of me. He hardly ever reaches out to catch up or hang out. Months will go by. I try to reach out and stay in touch with him but he does not reciprocate. I had been dealing with this over the past couple years now. I finally called him that I feel a little hurt and that it feels like he doesn't reach out or try to stay in touch- or care for that matter. His response is ""I'm just too busy"" sort of answer. I can also see on social media that he does hang out with other people- mostly the friends I've introduced him to. I feel really hurt by this. I don't understand why he all the sudden doesn't seem to care about me. I don't feel like I have any good friends I can go to anymore. Other close friends have done the same. I have had other friends that I became pretty close with who later I feel like started to treat me like they were 'too cool' to hang out with me anymore. I start to feel less respected and cared about. I'll ask them about things they're doing in their lives and won't be asked the same questions in return. When I do put forward information about things is my life I feel like they're less and less taken seriously or completely indifferent to it. Here's the other thing that confuses me: Some of these friends years later come out of the blue- if I run into them or they start commenting a ton on fb post and act like nothing happened and sometimes they are eager to hang out again. It makes me feel like all the sudden I've done something cool enough, or are hanging out with people they are interested in and want to join in. I don't know whether to ignore them or try to let things go and be friends. My fear is that if I do, we may become close again and they will just do the same thing. Im very confused why this happens. I don't know if I'm doing something to encourage this. When I say 'close friend' I do not mean calling every day or even every week and sharing every aspect of each other lives. Close friend just means some one you can talk to every once in a while, and who checks in to see how the other is doing. Is that asking for too much? I feel envious when I see how my girlfriend has couple good friends she talks to about her life and issues. I think it's healthy to have close friends other than your significant other you can do this with, I just don't understand why I can't hold close friends. Any advice would be welcomed. As a side note: since this has happened with my 'close friend' I have tried to widen my net and reach out to other people to hang out. I am becoming extremely exhausted. At age 33 now, I feel it is so difficult to try to hang out with other people. I feel like I do all the reaching out and it's making me feel extremely bitter about friends and relationships. I understand about casual friends, networking, or friends that are united around similar interests. I just get frustrated when that is the only thing that holds people together. I wonder- is that a symptom of living in a big city where everyone is trying to 'make it?' I think that, but then I'll hear about how some other casual friends keep in touch with each other still and give each other life advice etc. and just feel frustrated that I can't keep consistent good friends like that.

1,"Grandmother asks for loan to estranged father, then refuses to carry debt I'm mostly estranged from my father who has narcissistic personality disorder, lives as a squatter in the forest, and works only part-time. Meanwhile, I work in Silicon Valley. His sister made a huge effort to contact me, which I ignored for months understanding that she likely has a personality disorder as well. Eventually, I relented and agreed to meet my father for dinner over the holidays. In February, I received a call from my paternal grandmother saying my dad needs a loan because he lost his temporary job (he has regular seasonal employment) and employment-insurance benefits have recently been changed where he lives. I called my dad and he asked for a loan of $5,000. I felt sorry for the guy, so I wired him the money. After further thought, I feel this is quite a bit more than he needs to be homeless for a few months and carry his credit card payments until getting new employment. Meanwhile, my grandmother has just sold her mobile home for $60,000 and left a voicemail to tell me of this and ask if I was willing to drive down and pickup some boxes. This isn't realistic, if I did go there I would fly rather than drive for 8 hours. I called her back and asked if she would assume her son's debt. This saves me the stress of servicing the loan and I have no interest in lending money whatsoever. Since she has cash from selling her house, she is easily able to do this now. Her son can pay her back. She told me that the money from the house was needed for her retirement and that she's ""on social security."" I responded, ""I'm saving for retirement too."" (I make the full $18,500 401(k) contribution each year to avoid ending up in the forest like my dad and this in addition to paying into social security which probably won't even exist when I am 67) ""That's no way to talk to your grandmother. I'm going to hang up if you..."" at which point I hung-up the phone. My instinct her is to forget about getting the money back and just disconnect from all three: dad, grandmother, and the aunt (who I should have just ignored). Any thoughts? ",yonathanfisher.txt

0,"I am in a state of emptiness. Recently, I was in a relationship with someone who didn't love me, but I loved them intensely. I had hoped eventually she would turn around, but for that time, I found deep meaning in her. Now it's over, and she doesn't seem to care. Meanwhile, I am in hell. It's like the past four years of my life were just a dream. I feel humiliated, used and defeated. I feel like I have nothing. I lost my job, stopped going to school, and was forced to move back in with my parents. I feel like a total failure and completely worthless. I feel like I am being punished by God, and there is no way out. Even in my dreams I can't escape the pain. I can't see the good in anything anymore. Everywhere, I see pain and suffering, with no hope. Even when I meet incredible people who am in awe of, I feel almost envious, knowing that I am a worthless, useless nothing in the presence of angels. I still have some friends, but have grown distant from them. Seeing their success, no matter how minute, just reminds me of my worthlessness. I have nothing to offer the world. I am without purpose. Even when I have enough things to distract me, my ex is still in my dreams or nightmares every night. Before I met her, I got my life on track, was kicking ass in school, and headed for something. I know I can't blame her, but I just feel so stupid for getting caught up in her drama for no reason. What a waste. I don't know. I've been reflecting on my life a lot. I'm 27 and have nothing to show for it. I feel like I have to make drastic changes. Liquor and drugs are not doing me any good. I don't know what the hell I want anymore. I'm so lost, sometimes I don't even know if I'm really alive. I feel like right now, I have to settle for mediocrity and hope for simple low - stress job that pays the bills, but I don't have any source of joy or anything really to look forward too. I've pinpointed that the major source for depression and life problems as been my self-hatred. It manifests itself in many forms, including obsessive feelings of inadequacy and incompetence, paranoia, being overly - sensitive to criticism, feeling worthless, hopeless, and giving up too easy because of those feelings. Where did all this self - hatred come from? I don't want to blame my parents at my age, but I know that how they treated me when I was younger affected me and it still lingers in my psyche. They always employed the shame approach to parenting. Anytime something happened, my father would curse at me, and lecture me on how worthless I was. He would glare at me, and I just had to sit there and listen. Sometimes I would start crying, and then he would yell at me for crying, and say shit like ""look at you, you're not even ashamed."" Shame was apparently a virtue. My mother once told me when I was 8 that she wanted to have a third child, but because I was such a disappointment, she decided against it. They hit me frequently, with a bamboo stick. I remember they would constantly compare me to their friend's children, praising them and ask me why I couldn't be more like them. So all this happened, but I can't change the past. I don't want to dwell and blame my parents for their mistakes, no one is a perfect parent. I just want to get over these feelings of self - hatred and get my life in order. I've identified the source of my depression, but haven't been able to change all those feelings and thought-processes that have been ingrained in me since early childhood. Does anyone have any advice on how to overcome these feelings, and gain a sense of confidence and direction back? ",lector_e_1_b_c4_xx.txt

1,Well today is Augest 14 and this is the first posting of my first blog ever and I will write alot everyday so check back every night for some reading if your bored! Well first let me tell you a bit about me and where I live... My name is Trevor Nederlof I'm 15 and I live in a town called Westport which is in connecticut. I have a younger brother (Andrew) who is 13 as well as a black lab (Chloe) who is 10. We just moved to a new house near a river which goes through our small sized town. I am a geek because I love computers but at the same time I have a strong love for sailing... every type of boat may it be 10-150 feet I have done it all and love every moment of it.                 Last night I saw Aliens Vs. Predator which was a great action movie and I recommend it to everyone. Then I woke up at 3am to watch my cousins boyfriend artor  row in the olympics on a 2 man boat. I was tired when I awoke at 8am I started to unpack my room and help my cousin Jake who works for my mom take alot of the boxes from our move to the dump in town. I met my best friend David Brenner  (Everyone calls him Brenner) in town and we rode on bikes back to my house where we watched Da Alie G Show which is the funniest show EVER. After Brenner left I basicly just played computer games while helping my aunt and grandmother with the boxes from the move. Well Pizza will be here soon so I should go...           Look forward everynight by 8pm est (1 am GMT) I will post on my blog and I hope you all share with others so they to can read my life lol. Until tomarrow enjoy life because you only live once :) ,4234730.200408140.male.15.txt

Suicide is all I can think of right now and I'm scared to do it only because the thought of becoming a vegetable and having to live like that terrifies me.

They still tell me that even though I would love to go back 10 years now because of how much worse its gotten and how much better even that was compared to now. I didn't think it would get this bad but it did. I've been through so many medications, doctors, checked myself into a hospital 3 times when I was sure I was going to do kill myself, called the suicide hotline several times, talked with friends, made lifestyle changes and all that. It still didn't work. I've only gotten more depressed. There's no helping me. I am just supposed to feel miserable. I'll never be happy. I'm not sure at this point if I even want to be happy anyways.

But sex itself is not really the issue. There is a distinct lack of affection. We never make out. Or really kiss unless I initiate it. Or hug much. It makes me feel shitty and lonely when I'm consistently the one pulling her in for a hug etc. I've spoken to her about it and she gets defensive and says she gives me plenty of affection and makes it seem like I've got a problem.

1,"How can I tell me friend that I don't want to babysit his (difficult) kid? I want to be a good friend, and there for him in case of emergencies. I've picked up his kid from daycare before when his babysitter called out on him. But then he asked me to babysit and the hours ended up being 8AM to 7PM(!). He asked me two weeks ago if I could babysit on February 3rd, and I told him I couldn't make a commitment so far in advance. (Knowing he'd have plenty of time to find a sitter). This is clearly not an emergency, and he's about to ask me again (it's a week away). I know I shouldn't have led him on at all; that it's better to be direct. But dear god, I cannot come up with the words to tell him I would rather die than spend any more time alone with his son.

1,"Husband in hospital and I am at a complete loss Hi all long time lurker first time poster. Using a throw away since it would destroy my husband if he saw this. I am on mobile and a bit sleep deprived, so sorry for the format or dreaded grammar errors. TLDR at bottom. Honestly I don’t need advice I just need to let everything out now before i explode. And (un)fortunately my husband is my best friend leaving me feeling alone with no one to talk to.  I have a 20month old and am 35 weeks pregnant. My husband for the last few weeks has been feeling nauseous and out of sorts. I finally convinced him to go to a redicare. Well those jerks turned him away since they can’t help with abdominal pain. I wasn’t with him or they would have seen him. He ended up going to another urgent care. There they realized he had a bp of 220/112. First annoyance if the first place took his vitals we could have headed straight to the ER. We met up and got him there right away. We were at the ER for several hours before they made the decision to admit him to the cardiac unit of the hospital. Since then they have discovered a kidney issue and have not gotten a handle on the bp.  They have no answers but seem to be coming up with more questions. He isn’t even 30 so the fact this is happening is extremely bizarre. His mother was here to help, but I am at my wits end and needed to be alone this evening. We just moved our daughter to a toddler bed Saturday which is doing great at night but she hasn’t napped in 3 days. She is crabby and obviously confused since daddy isn’t home. She is also in a phase where hitting mommy is funny. She hit me today and I just burst into tears. Which according to my mil is my hormones which really helped the situation.  I can’t sleep and am vomiting from pregnancy and stress. I know I have to be strong for her and him and unborn, but I am failing. I spent 2 hours tonight just crying. I keep losing my temper with my daughter. I wish I could be at the hospital with him. I feel stranded, alone and useless. I don’t know how I can help him. He is spiraling down into a pit of depression and I have no way of helping him out. I keep calling and texting him which I can tell he doesn’t want. We are going to visit tomorrow morning then my mom is going to come here tomorrow so I can go see him again without the little one. But I haven’t been home much the past 2 days and I know it is taking a toll on her. I just recently became a stay at home which has created separation anxiety issues. I feel torn between to 2 people who mean the world to me and I am failing both of them.

1,"bad friend I’ve been friends with this guy for a few months now. At first things were really great and he was a really good friend, but the past two months he’s been a major DICK. I’ve been keeping my distance and not really talking to him as much. I have 3 weeks to either fix this failing friendship or get rid of it. I’ve decided that if it doesn’t get better in the next week, i will spend the following week trying to get rid of this friendship, and the third week dealing with the aftermath. I just don’t know how to, if i need to, end this friendship without being a major dick in return.

0,"[F17] I really need someone to listen This is a throw-away, because I don't want anyone in my personal life to see this. Let me preface this by saying I've been diagnosed with bipolar tendencies (i guess you can't diagnose bipolar disorder until you're 18), severe depression, chronic anxiety and body dysmorphia. I've been hospitalized for a suicide attempt almost two years ago, and I've struggled with self harm since fourth grade. I was bullied relentlessly throughout elementary and middle school. Thankfully, i've been clean for a year, and after the hospital I got on medication and things started to get better for a while. My senior year has been great so far but it's starting to get bad again. I used to be a social smoker, but now I'm completely dependent on marijuana for everything. I'm not hungry unless I smoke and I can't fall asleep unless I smoke. I need it to get through the day. I can't go to college, because I can't afford it and my mom says she can't consign on a loan for me. I totally understand that too, because if my dad were to die she'd be in trouble and in tens of thousands of dollars in debt. I'm just sad because I want to go away like all of my friends but I can't. My dad is most likely going to lose his job soon apparently too, which is going to put us in poverty. My mom and dad fight all the time, and hate each other. They've both talked about getting a divorce to me exclusively. I pretend like it doesn't bother me, but it does. My dad is addicted to prescription painkillers, and locks himself in his room the minute he gets home. He comes to my choir concerts, plays, and musicals but leaves almost immediately after it starts, which hurts me a lot. I pretend like I don't care about that either. The thing that hurts me the most now is my dog was put down today. She was my first dog. I was allergic to dogs when I was way younger. I grew out of it and it took so long to find her, because my mom was set on picking the perfect dog for us. We found her, and now she's gone. I was the one who stayed in the room with her, because my mom couldn't do it. I pet and comforted her while she died. I've never had to cope with someone dying before, and it's so hard. She was just a dog, but I still loved her so much. I want her back so bad. My problems are so minor compared to some people's, but I'm so sad right now. I don't know what to do. This is the first time in a while that I've wanted to kill myself, but I don't want to go down that road again. I just don't know how to cope anymore. ",blehbleh234.txt

No woman would ever be into me and I'm gonna die a virgin.

My brother has an attraction to me which really creeps me out. He's all the time running around the house naked, hitting on me, 'helping' me adjust my dresses so his hands can slide dangerously near my chest. It really, really disturbs me. My problem is that he asked me if it was all right if he hung around naked and stuff when I was drunk. I told him yes because I didn't have my mind about me. Now I can't think of how to tell him that it makes me uncomfortable and that I don't want him doing it anymore. Along with that I just lost my best friend due to depression. I've been trapped in my house for two weeks and I haven't seen my mom, dad, brother, or sister for more than five minutes in this entire time. I just want to run away from it all. I don't want to kill myself, but I do want to pack and go and just get away from this wretched town. Would it be such a bad thing to leave?

0,"Hey, My name is Jonathan. I'm 23 years old. I'm a senior in college hoping to be through very VERY soon. I went through a really rough depression era starting around the age of 15 and lasting till I was 21. It started to get a little better when I got into college, but then severely accelerated throughout the years. I took a year off from school to work and basically to get help, which I did. I found out a lot of my depression was cognitive... thinking negatively about myself. When I was growing up, I was a real shy guy. I think some of that though has turned into a social anxiety issue, but I didn't have a great social. I still don't, but once I got help, the psychologist I saw really helped me get past the negative thinking, but I still have really tightly bound emotional issues from time to time that tend to really upset me. It's taken pieces of my personality and completely do a 180. Part of my depression was that I was co-dependent. Now I'm really completely independent. I guess I'm trying more to understand than to get just advice. I can't make sense of my emotions anymore. ",joenathan_e_1_a_1_xx.txt

I never ask my parents for money I eat at home so they don't give me money for lunch I don't buy things I'm using old phone that i bought 6 years ago with my own money. But my mother changed 3 phones in the last year. They threat my sister a lot better they gifted her a phone for christmas i got some shitty speakers that had the price tag on and believe me their price was not close to the phone's. They bought her a new car last year they gave her the money for the driving lessons and she want money from them everyday. So i need a new PC at the moment so i thought that i might ask them because i really need it and that's the only thing i have ever ask my parents for my I haven't asked for a single cent in my whole life. Everything i buy i buy with my saved money from grandparents. I even buy my studentbooks with my own money. And they refused. They told me if i have the money to buy it but I spent all i had to buy furniture for my room if i didn't i would've gotten only a bed in my room. I feel hated. They don't spend time with me neither give me money. Yesterday I offered them to give me the money for the PC and when i have the money i will return them but they still said no.

1,"How I Learned About My Birthfather... &amp; My Brother? I remember when I was around 11, my little cousin, Lily, who was 6, came from Cuba to the U.S. with her parents. They stayed in our home for a few months until they were able to find a place. Right before they left for their new home; I was on my computer, I was 12, playing educational computer games. My family is chattering/gossiping in the living room per usual. I never had any interest in the family gossip, I just wanted to be in my own little space/world. Lily was not like that at all, she loved to listen-in on family drama. It was not long until Lily came barging into the room saying: ""I know a secret."" ""What?"" ""Roberto isn't your real dad."" ""Liar."" ""I'm not lying, they're talking about it!"" ""I don't believe you, so just leave me alone."" ""Just ask your mom."" After that she left the room and the seed of doubt was planted in my head. I did not think twice of it at that moment. It sure as hell bothered the hell out of me for days.. then weeks.. and eventually to months, to almost a year. It wasn't long after, I started to doubt it myself. I did not really look like my father, Roberto. He was light-medium brown skin color, I had pale skin with freckles. My mother had a light tan. Things that I did not notice before started to bother me. The difference in skin color, I did not have his last name, there were not baby pictures of him holding me. I did not feel a connection to this man. I was 13, almost 14, when I decided to confront my mom about it while she was organizing important documents. There was something about this that was bugged me was that... I KNEW the answer to her question BEFORE she could respond. I was 99.9% sure already, but I still had that 0.1% in order to fully believe it. ""Mom, can I ask you something?"" ""What?"" ""Is Roberto my real dad?"" ""No."" ""Who is?"" ""I can't talk right now, I'm busy."" It was at that moment that I knew she did not really care to talk about it. Of course, I would bring it up again and she would brush it off just the same. ""I'm busy,"" or ""Not right now."" After a while, I stopped communicating with my mother and our relationship has suffered, to this day, because of it. It was not long after my mother asked for a divorce to my step-father. I remember her sitting me down on the couch and talking to me through it. I did not have a strong relationship with Roberto to begin with, it hurt to an extent, but it was not something that I felt devastated over. She did end up telling me that she married Roberto to provide me a father figure. On my 14th birthday, Roberto tells my mother and aunt that we need to leave the house permanently. The day after my birthday, we packed up our things the same day and left. All of this happened one week before school started, I was going to start high school. It was hard for the first few months, and around that time I started to get more curious about my birthfather as Roberto was separating himself from the picture. So I began to research him, ask my mother (always backfires on me), and listening to family gossip. One of the few things I caught was that my mother came into the U.S. legally, unknowingly pregnant. When she began to go see the doctors for a check-up, that is when she found out she was pregnant. Got married to my step-father, Roberto, when I was 2yrs, and from there I believed he was my father all along up until I asked her. On April 20th, 2017 I received a random friend request on Facebook. The last name was exactly like my last name and strangely enough, looking at this guy's profile picture, he looked a lot like me -- strange. It took me a few days of speculation to finally grow the balls to accept the friend request after 6 days, April 25th. ""May I ask who you are? And do you have any relationship to Alexander?"" ""I am his son. From what I see, you're my sister."" From there he asked for my phone number. I was still skeptical and asked for details such as my birthfather's birthday and my mother's name to prove it. Once it was proven, I gave him me information. I found out I had a little brother in Cuba, he turned just 19 this year in January. My birthfather and his family were in Cuba. My brother 3½ yrs younger than me. It is absolutely crazy thinking how I was raised as an only child, while he was raised knowing I existed somewhere in the world. I still have trouble wrapping my head around this. I video chatted with my birthfather, Alexander, and brother, Lazaro, for hours. My father was crying. I did not get the full details on HOW they found me, it was hard to understand -- the Internet connection was extremely bad and it costs a lot of money to communicate from Cuba to the United States. I saw my grandparents for the first time. My grandfather was crying on the webcam and my grandmother was crying as well. They looked so happy and kept telling me that they prayed to God every day to just see me and that I was happy/healthy. We all laughed, we cried, we smiled. It was bittersweet. We asking questions and answering them through smiles, tears, and laughter. Unfortunately, a lot of time has passed, and that would be the first and only time I would have seen my grandmother. She died unexpectedly on December 24th, 2017. (R.I.P. Abuela Ramona) Hopefully, I can make a trip out to Cuba this year so that I can meet my family. My mother will not be joining me on my trip as she does not want to be part of that. I am not mad at my mother, I am just disappointed in the way she kept such a secret from me. I do not trust her on the same level as I did prior to all of it. My hands are shaking as I write all of this down. I am still trying to wrap my head around it. It is 2018 now and I will be planning a trip this summer to see them hopefully. The realization is hitting me that I am anxious beyond belief. I felt as though I babbled a little too much, but I needed to get this all out. This was therapeutic for me. I am going to sleep now, good night ladies and gentlemen. Sleep well. I will be making a new post about meeting them. Thank you for reading. ",Vonnae.txt

1,"How To Get Over The Pain I ended/lost a friendship with a best friend of 14 years. She was really good to me, once upon a time; I was declared disabled and lost my house and she let me move in with her and her husband to get back on my feet. For all she knew I could've been the Thing That Never Leaves. But I lived with her for about 9 months, got a job, and got my own place. She's Mormon, and during this time had her first kid. She insists everything's fine, no worries (because she had to, I think; Mormons put a lot of pressure on their women.) But things start getting distant between us, and this is only something I notice in hindsight. I got the greenlight to publish a book, and she offered to typeset because she had InDesign. Okay, are you sure? Yes. You're sure? Yes. Okay, cool, thanks, that's awesome, I don't have to do it myself cause I don't have the program or know how to use it. I give her a deadline for October and pay her. Well, I bust my ass on this book for months. It's the most important thing I've ever done with my life and it means everything to me. And 4 days before deadline, I find out she's only done up to Chapter 5 on the book. Which basically means she fucked off for 4 months, and did nothing, which means she's going to do a rush job. That automatically means more mistakes that I have to depend on her to fix, which she didn't in the first place, and she's totally shattered my trust. I freaked the fuck out on her and had a hysterical meltdown. It was bad, and I don't make any excuses for it. I was really shitty to her. I panicked and thought she was going to hold the book hostage with procrastination, and I had no way to get the files from her. I'd put myself up shit creek, because it was too late for me to learn InDesign. Well, she was defensive, to say the least. She said I don't need to police her time, and I should've known this is how she works. I felt like she was trying to gaslight me, so I posted on Facebook about the situation without naming names and asked other professional artist friends if this was appropriately professional behavior. They said no. That REALLY pissed her off, because a few days later I got a letter. In it she said she'd done all this stuff for me (let you live in my house, put up with your shit etc.), said I didn't want her to have her dream family and dream life (she was doing horse archery competitions and I didn't want her to do that, either, apaprently), my shitty upbringing made me dysfunctional, and she gave me an ultimatum that I had to make a change. Until then she said she didn't want me to talk to her, and she was ""closing her door to me."" I felt supremely judged, i.e. ""My perfect Mormon family was NEVER dysfunctional, so obviously you're the problem here, as a dysfunctional person yourself. Not me."" I felt like I'd been un-forgiven, ""Hey, remember all that stuff I said I forgave you for? Surprise!"" And I felt horrible, like I could never apologize enough, and that from here on out I was going to be scapegoated because I was the fucked up one and she was the squeaky-clean Mormon. I left her alone for about 6 week, not talking to her like she said. Then I reached out, apologized, and asked if we could talk in person without anymore nastygram letters. And this, to be honest, is where I'm most mad at myself, because I wish I'd just cut things off the minute she started talking like her shit didn't stink. Instead, we met, and she said my apology made her angry because it sounded like I'd disregarded her letter. I was a bit taken aback, because the letter sounded like one of those venting things where you're supposed to write them but not send them, and instead she was acting like she'd sent me gospel I needed to abide by. I said I felt like I was always going to be the wrong one, no matter what. She said I came from a dysfunctional family, compared me to a fear-agressive dog, and said ""Which problem is more in need of fixing?"" So in other words, yeah. Yeah, I was always going to be wrong, because no matter what she did I was always going to be worse because of my background. She said I'd declared her typesetting ""a failure"" before I even saw it, and insisted she'd done a good job. I told her there were obvious mistakes, like misaligned tabs and words running into illustrations, and she said she'd made the deadline and reiterated that once again, I should have known she procrastinates. I told for someone who had gone to church for twenty plus fucking years, she didn't know how forgiveness works because Jesus doesn't say ""Forgive thine enemies, until you've got a whole pile of ammunition and can really use that shit against them."" (I'm agnostic.) She said she'd already apologized (implication being that I couldn't forgive) and when I told her it felt like she could never make a mistake, she screamed ""YOU JUST WANT ME TO GROVEL!"" and stormed off. Her husband came out, yelled at me, and told me to ""handle my shit"" and called me a toddler. Previously he'd admitted to me in private that he wouldn't hire his own wife for a job because of her lack of professionalism. The next day I wrote her saying I needed my book files, to make sure the publisher could make corrections. And once that was good to go, I told her I was glad we weren't friends anymore, because all her judgement was off my shoulders. She said she would have fixed the typesetting mistakes if I'd just told her, DURING the time she'd explicitly said not to talk to her, so it was my fault again for not getting things corrected. I was arrogant, you see, and she said she wasn't angry, just that she felt sorry for me, and told me ""You are your family."" I am genuinely glad to not be friends with her anymore. She made the worst of assumptions about me, turned on me when SHE fucked up and made it MY fault, and got hyper-defensive and toxic  in her behavior while simultaneously calling me dysfunctional. Hindsight is 20/20, and I feel like she had too much to do with her baby, couldn't say no, and resented the task in the first place. She said she didn't come home every night and think ""I'm not going to work on typesetting tonight, just to piss off Plethora"" as if good intentions can't pave the road to hell and hurt people. I said we were shitty to each other, but she won't admit fault at all. And I know I don't need a judgemental perfectionist in my life. But I'm still hurt, and outraged, and angry. I keep finding myself having arguments in my head when I'm driving or trying to fall asleep. I'm furious that everything became conditional suddenly, that I was retroactively unforgiven, and treated in the worst way by someone who sees themselves as morally superior. Winter is just finishing up so I haven't really been able to get out fo ra Meetup or something, but it's hard not to fee like you can't make a relationship work when a 14 year one just went down the drain because of something you did. I've read some other Reddits, where people have lost friendships over things like weddings, which make me feel a bit better. Bitching someone out because they dropped the ball on your creative work suddenly doesn't seem so unreasonable. But I'm mad I tried to make things work even after a bunch of red flags telling me I should've known better, and STILL ended up feeling like shit because I ""apologized wrong"" and ""wasn't good enough."" I miss who my friend used to be, not who she is now. I feel like the only thing that's going to take away the pain is time, but it's been months and I still feel the same way, and feel like I'm justified in never trusting anyone again, because if 14 fucking years aren't enough, what is? How do you get over the pain of things ending so badly when part of it was your responsibility, too? ",Plethora77.txt

1,"I [22/m] and a friend of mine [20/m] had a dispute which questions our friendship. TL;DR, OP misread the situation by telling a joke to which his drunk friend took offence and revealed to OP's other friends OPs 3-year buried drug habit. OPs friends now know things OP originally wanted to be left in the past. ********* My friend (let's call him T, for now) and I had a dispute over what we classify as exposing each other. T was very drunk and gave some information I kept very personal out to my other friends and myself who were sober at the time. He mentioned the last time I got high, but he did mention how long ago. This is important because Ive had an on and off history of depression which I've been struggling with years, and I previously I used to combat it by developing a drug habit. I've been working hard to be clean for 3 years, and I've kept all this under the rug because I didn't wish to be labelled by my friends as irresponsible, or be denied respect as their friend. I buried my past and drug habits for good,  doing so brought me great happiness because this was the first thing I felt I like I myself was worth something and it let me come out of depression for a long time. He did all this because I had made a joke in this particular conversation, to which he reacted negatively, and said I ruined his reputation though my joke was not intentional to do so. Because of this, people I trust  now are asking me if I do drugs or partake in self harm because of what he said about me. Some people I'm friends with are asking me if I need counselling though I'm clean. I'm not sure if I can forgive him and it's made me feel less than a person, which is something I haven't felt in 3 years. I feel worthless again and I'm not quite sure I can mend all my friendships that probably think down upon lowest point in life. Should I cut ties with T? What should I do if now my other friends  might not see me the same way anymore? ",LudacrisMargrine.txt

0,"I'm a 33 year old man with a history of depression (I was diagnosed when I was 10) and of ""standing apart"" -- not refusing to fit in out of some sense of rebellion, but not fitting in simply because I couldn't. I have never been married. I've had only one long term relationship -- it was long - distance and very turbulent for both my partner and I (the relationship ended three years ago). To this day I wonder why I don't ""measure up"", why I can't seem to find my place in life. While not physically stunning by any means, I never thought I was hideous, either -- though my looks have most often been pointed out to me as a shortcoming, so that's the explanation I tend to go with most of the time. When I hit my teenage years, panic disorder became a problem, too (as I realized how little control I had over my life and the way it was going to turn out). At the beginning of each year, I stand back and take stock of my situation, asking myself: where am I right now? Which direction am I headed in from here? What are my options? Up until now, I could always find some reason to be at least a little hopeful, to keep going -- but this year I can't. I've been out of work for a long time, the panic attacks are getting bad again, I've had a number of relatively minor but still worrisome health problems in the last few months -- and worst of all, after so many years, I'm still alone. There are no prospects out there; no one wants to be with me. I'm in a lot of pain and I don't know how to make it better.

I am 32 years old, I was very close to my mother.. We had a bond that was as strong as steel. My dad whom she was with since the age of 15 left her 11 years ago for another woman and found happiness. She had never been with any other man. I have an older sister that is 42 and we had different relationships. My mother was angry and could never get over my dad, year after year we would hear how much she hated him but still loved him, she would wish they could be one again. It never happened, she had been with no one and remained lonley for 11 years. Her depression became her life, it was so bad we would stop talking to her because all she would talk about is killing herself and how she hated my dad. 10 years of it, She had little money and was very sick, She went from healthy to brittle in a matter of 10 years. Back surgery's, aching bones, depression, pain pain and more pain. It became up to me and my sister to take care of her, she couldn't drive so we always had to drive over to take her to the dr, groceries or to get things she needed, it became stressfull and we would somtimes bicker over it..even after the divorce my dad helped when he wanted to or could. She started thinking she was a burden.. then started lashing out on us at times, I went a whole year not speaking to her until she called me to apologize for her horrible words with me. I forgave her and we began a relationship again...this time it was amazing again, we got along and finally after 10 years she accepted my partner. Long story short drama hit the fan again in early Nov this year. Things were said between her and my sister and they got me involved, I got upset with my mom and she was so hurt and thought that I thought she was a liar. My sister told me she said something about my son that she claimed she didn't. I didn't care after a while, I had plans with her on the day before thanksgiving to go see her.. on the 19th of NOV. She asked on the 19th if i could come hook up her VCR so she could watch A Christmas Story, I told her next weekend, then she later that night got upset again, she texted all of us the usual suicide talk. I had told her the day before that I didn't want anymore drama, if i went over with my family I didn't want to hear about my dad and sister. I just wanted to have a good time. She then texted me and a lot of other family that she loved me. that it wasn't my fault, she bought the gun... (I took her to get that gun for protection so I always told her if she did that I would feel to blame) She would say "" SON I bought it! Dont feel to blame"" I hated that! Still I never belived she would do it.. I was so bitter about her not wanting to be possitive I hadent called her. I ignored her suicide text and just decided to let her cool off.. 20th, 21st-29th we hadnt spoken.. I had a bad feeling but didnt know why.. she hadnt called.. so i figured she was angry with me.. I get a call from my aunt on my dads side who she was very close with.. ""Is it true? The rumors about your mom?"" I was picking up my kids from school.. I said ""huh? what she say about me this time hahaha?"" ""Call your sister"" she said.. I called and she told me to go home right away.. Then she said when getting home "" Mom... mom... *cries*... Moms dead.. she killed herself"" I said ""dont say that"" about 12 times breaking down more and more each time I repeated it.. I fell apart crying for who know how long... day one was hard, day two was harder, day 3 was numb and empty and I couldn't cry or sleep, day 4 I then hit a new horrible moment.. I found out she had been in her apartment dead since the 20th.. the complex lied and said no one heard anything and thats another story.. they are being sued soon.. her body was in there so long that we will not have an open casket this week in her funeral.. Then i went into her apartment to start gathering her things.. i smelled the death and decay.. I have never felt so sick and horrified in my life. I will never forget it.. i went to where she did it and saw the carpet cut out and her bed gone.. her place was left just like I last saw it.. it killed me.. I am now on day 6 and her ceremony is tomorrow in her home town.. Idk what to think or feel anymore.. my wife is trying to support me cause her mom died when she was 17 but i am changing..

0,"Well, I guess, i mean i know I need help. I lost my husband . he died of a heart attack at 56 on his walk home from a police station from being arrested for soliciting a prostitute., two years ago, can't get over it. It was a bad scene, we were not great lovers or anything like that, more like companions, he cheated on me a lot and i just accepted it, but we did things together, ate out a lot, went to flea markets, he was nice to me, he loved me , he was just stupid, and i wouldn't have sex with him because of his indiscretion, I think he understood that. After he died, about 6 months or so, I started going to a psychiatrist. He put me on lots of medications, it cost a lot of money, I was still depressed somewhat and really, I don't think he understood me at all. So about 6 months ago, I quit, everything, medications, therapy, etc. I have a 30 year old son that lives with me and causes me a lot of grief, he has diabetes really bad and no job. Two days ago he was lethargic and his blood sugar was 500, I had to take him to the ER and I know it's going to cost me thousands of dollars. I have no extra money, but what does a person do. I tried to get him to get a job and it just turns into a yelling crying i am going to through you out of the house thing ... He is my child, I won't throw him out , .. oh, he also has adult ADD. I have a real hard time socializing because i have low self esteem, I am fat, 53 years old, not very attractive, and on and on. When I try to improve myself, I get frustrated, the weight , .... etc. I think about suicide but that is stupid, I never act on anything like that. It's just a passing though time to time.

0,"Advice for getting back in touch with everyday life? I think the hardest thing for me, and the largest factor I need to address to try and feel healthy again, is simply trying to feel engaged in and enjoying the present. Right now, days have little to no meaning at all, and I am only really able to think of my life in terms of weeks, months, and years. As a result of that, I feel nothing from the hobbies or moments that would before provide me feelings of joy, satisfaction or just generally fulfilling myself. The only activities I really ""enjoy"" anymore is anything that provides me with a complete escape from reality, however these activities are not exactly one belonging to a healthy lifestyle. I just want to enjoy the things that I used to enjoy, but whenever I try I feel like I am wasting my time, are not doing them well enough.

1,"Clingy friend So I have a friend who lives pretty far from me. Let me preface this by saying that he has expressed a romantic interest in me, but I am not interested in men, and have told him so. He helped me through a difficult time in my life, and I have thanked him many times for it. I have tried to do the same for him on multiple occasions, but it seems like the more attention I give him, the more he wants. I do not feel that we need to have hour long phone discussions and 26 text messages on a daily basis - I don’t talk to ANYONE that much. I started ignoring a text or two here and there, hoping he would catch on. He did, apparently, and we just went about 3 weeks with no contact. Had he sent me a normal text today, I would have answered. Instead, he sent a passive-aggressive “Ever since you’re feeling better, you never bother to call me.” This is simply NOT true. I have called him many times when he said he needed to talk, even though I hate talking on the phone. I just simply can’t take this level of neediness. I’m not sure how to explain to him that constant contact drives me nuts and I need space. Every time I try to explain this to him, he seems to feel that it was designed as a personal attack against him. Any thoughts on this? I’m not going to text him back until I’ve had some time to think about the right thing to say. ",julster4686.txt

The theatre was nearly empty because it was 4pm on a Tuesday, but these two fat men sat a seat away from us. I think I counted 7 other people in the whole theatre. Not to mention one of these guys got on his cell phone for about 30 minutes. HOLY SHIT!!! I swear, some people need to be shot. Anyways, after the movie we sat in the parking lot debating about where to eat. Of course Elise refused to contribute, except for places within eyesight, so I had to choose. We finally went to Orlando's  where we proceded to eat overpriced (but very very good)  food. Afterwards we went to Elise's mom's house cuz her mom had made a chocalate cake. I stayed for about an hour then went home. I would have stayed longer, but I didnt want to overstay my welcome (especially since I havent been there in quite some time). All in all, I think the whole thing went pretty good.   Today I woke up at noon, which I HATE doing, but I was so tired.

Or even when he claims he’s coming to get the dog he left with my uncle (left him there a year ago claiming it would only be for two weeks) he just lies constantly. I was raised around my family growing up. I didn’t see my father but I saw his side of the family, cousins, aunts and uncles. They may have lived states away but we always spent summers and holidays together. At this point my family on either side rarely see each other. We have family reunions that none of my cousins attend, all too busy now that their grown. At the end of the day I was told this; I’m an adult and my father has nothing to do with the things I’ve done in life, or nothing to do with the guys I used to talk to that led to constant rejection and overall cynical view on love (getting sperm donor at 28.) I should be grateful for times spent with him, five minutes should be the best in the world (he’s so self absorbed I’m only worth five minutes every few months) I have no right as a child to threaten him if he wont leave me alone for good. I don’t see why I have to live like this, I suffer from depression and constantly beatbox myself up over every mistake I make. I’m unhappy, I’ve been getting better since getting rid od him and focusing on the family that actually has time time for me. A family shouldn’t just be there for emergency. A family is thinking of others before themselves, loving one another enough to know them. Am I really expecting or demanding too much? Am I just mad because yet another man won’t do what I want?

1,"to everone older and younger than i am, i would like to say that i am sorry for the way things will be. a lot of my peers are senseless, ignorant, angry, and belligirent. god forbid any generation raises a new generation that's not intelligent as they were,well unfortunately this has happened. as i approach adulthood i look at my peers and wander how some of them could ever become productive members society, and how they ever could function as rational, inteligable adults. i see childlike outbursts of violence, lack of respect for others and athourity and an overall lack of concern for the future. very few of my peers have an intrest in anything that could help the development of our country or our society or themselves,it's not cool. i fear that our parents will be left to control the country in their old age instead of their chidren.i think that our society will becom more corrupt andviolent as time progresses making the world a not such a great place to be. i fear that the next generation will be even worse, kids having kids is not cute it's stupid, and laughing when your or your teenagers baby does something wrong is not cute or funny ,its even worse, it teaches your child to develop an unhealthy outlook to the behavior it will show to everyone as he/she grows up.to my peers learn to show a little respect, no mater how grownup you think you are shut up and listen, weall have a lot to learn. to the adults, i'm sorry that not all of us are great children, not the best generation yet, by far, also please don't try to defend your childs wrong behavior because you feel you are being personally attacked as a parent, it's o.k. to defend your parental beliefs, but be careful to check wether its your child or your pride you're defending, and also we don't really hate all of you we may be angry and do stupid things but we still love you parents/gaurdians.to the babies of my peers i am truly sorry, you will have a really hard life, your parents are probabally underprepared, and ignorant of how to raise a child.  everyone may not agree with what i've said, it was not intended to offend any of you, ut whats said is said, idf you think i'm wrong, then don't take it to heart. i may very well be wrong, i've still got a lot to learn.

0,"Why did they forget me? I was never someone people would consider anti-social. Rather, I was the opposite. I loved talking to people, meeting new people, and just being social. In highschool, I never had a ""group"" of friends per se, but I knew almost everyone in my grade, and was friends with a lot of them. After high school, I went to a local university, so I'd have to commute to my school, unlike the rest of my classmates who went to to schools further away. My current university is a huge commuter school, so there's no on campus experience to be had, and I'm actually transferring to a local community college instead, so I can transfer out later. Through all this, the friends I had in high school have all kind of forgotten about me. Even in high school, I'd be the first to message people, or the one to initiate hangouts and whatnots. But now, in college, its the same but so much more lonely. All my friends are away, and I'm rotting here. I feel so alone. On top of this, I miss my ex from a year ago. We went from meeting, to best friends, to huge fallout, to reconciliation, to best friends, to dating, to nothing. I miss the friend part. This loss has dampened my mood for a year now. Just overall, I feel so lonely. A year ago I felt on top of the world, and now, I'm back to shit. All I ever wanted was someone to message me first saying ""Hey dude, how are ya?"" Its been a while"". The worst was Thanksgiving break, where I had excitedly messaged a few people saying I'm so happy to see them and we (read: I asked to) made plans to hangout. A lot of them fell through. Others postponed till Christmas break. I messaged 28 people one day, desperate to talk to someone. I feel like I will never be anyone's ""everything"" ya know? I want a dog. Not just because its cute and all, but I want a companion that will never forget me, and will love me. I hate myself. Depression sucks. Loneliness sucks. I just want to cry.

0,"I'm new and my message doesn't seem to fit anywhere else. I have been suffering from depression since I was 15 (now 21) but I've only recently thought of it as 'depression' as I used to think it was just me and all my feelings were real. It started with wanting to end up in hospital - get hit by a car etc. I felt useless and boring and unwanted by my family or anyone. Felt like I was jus in the way wherever I went. I felt empty and the only escape I ever had was fantasizing about the day I die - that release that I would feel from everything. So I used to write suicide notes and when I could read them without crying then I would deem myself ready. Or I would think that if I could starve myself for a week then I would be ready. (This one I couldn't do) finally it all got too much. In my head, my parents were so disappointed in me that they would be better off without me and to my sisters I was too annoying that they wouldn't miss me. Up until now I had jus cut myself discreetly. So I took 80 paracetamol (not knowing then that they can't actually kill you) and jus sat around waiting - half excited half scared. Nothing happened for ages and I started to get more scared - what would my parents think? Would they cope? Would they blame themselves? So I threw up and called an ambulance myself. I will never get over how hurt they were by what I had done and so will never do that again. But I still think bout it. When ever things get too hard. I think how can I make it look like an accident as I know they could handle that much better than suicide. I have been on antidepressants for 8 months now. For the 3rd time. But it seems that they are just putting a 'blanket' over how I'm feeling and I'm not addressing the real issues; not that I know what they are. I can't get motivated to study, go to class, go out, anything. I don't care. I don't see the point in living a miserable life and what if there is no point? what if our worlds are all the creation of our minds and once our minds are dead, so is our world so there's no one left hurting once were gone? What is the point to a miserable life when it could all be ended now? I don't think suicide is the right way to go - I believe only god, whatever you conceive him to be (if anything) should have the only power over life and death, but why does he take some people and not others? (More specifically, me?) I pray that he will take me next - give me the cancer meant for someone who loves life - but as yet has been to no avail. But if all we are to do is to be alive then die, why can I not decide to take my death into my own hands, like so many people do what they want with their lives? Of course, there's always the factor of limbo - do people who commit suicide really end up in limbo? I suppose what scares me even more is that - going through the pain and anguish of suicide just to end up in limbo - with just your mind, thinking away for ever.... are my feelings wrong? Is it a chemical reaction in my brain? Or do I just not belong in this life? So confused! And just don't see the point in being here - anyone have the answers I'm looking for? Life is pointless.

0,"I've posted a few times on these forums and everyone has always been so helpful and supportive, so I'm hoping I can get some help with this.  For the last few weeks, my depression has been so horrendous, worse than it's ever been, that I have not been able to go to work.  I keep calling in sick, and then when I can finally make myself go, I hide in the bathroom crying or go to an empty office (not in my cubicle) and call my mother and cry to her.  I've been in touch with my pdoc, who is in the process of passing me off to another doctor.   Granted, it's at my request, as he is not on my insurance.  However, he's not willing to put me on any other types of medications since he won't be seeing me regularly.  I've spoken to my long - time pdoc from Dallas, my hometown, and he knows me very well.  I trust him more than any other doctor, which is not saying much, but he says that I'm unipolar, aka major depressive disorder, and a mood stabilizer would be the next best thing to try since all the antidepressants are not working.  (was taking 30mg celexa, just upped to 40mg when this all started.)  I'm seeing a new pdoc that's covered by my insurance on Monday, so maybe things will move forward. Ok, so back to the work thing.  My supervisor is not sympathetic to my problem.  In all fairness, I have not told her details.  I find that most people do not consider mental disease a real medical problem.  She suggested that I talk to Human Resources about taking some type of leave if I don't know when I'll be better.  I'm working on that and hoping one of these doctors will sign for me. The biggest problem I have is the guilt over missing work.  I never imagined that the depression could get so bad that I couldn't just suit up and show up.  That's been my motto every time things get rough.  I guess I'm looking for validation here.  If I really do have it in my to get to work, I certainly can't find it.  I'm a very responsible person, so this is not like me.  The only time I've ever called in sick is when I was having depression issues, but never more than one day.  Everyone gets a sick day, and I never get the flu or anything, so I don't feel guilty about those days. What do I do?  Am I looking at this the wrong way?  It's so hard to be objective when you are so low.  My saving grace is that my parents (who are far away in Dallas) are being the most supportive people in the world.  They believe me when I say I just can't get to work, since that's not like me, but that's not like them either, so I know they want me to get there if I can. Thanks to anyone who took the time to read this.  I'm hoping someone else has gone through it and can help. ",ashwell_e_2_b_c3w_us.txt

First of all I must confess that I am the worst writer in the world, my grammar, punctuation and spelling are atrocious. It doesn't matter that there is spell check on this...it just don't matter! I am hopeless!!!!  I feel very old but I know I really am not. I am only 42, well I will be 43 soon. I am a single female, well not really single. I am in a relationship and have been for almost 6 years. My relationship is with another female who is 3 yrs. younger than me. What is age? Just a number. I don't look my age. I look maybe 5-6 yrs. younger than I am if not more on a really good day! Now my body feels like it is 143, which is a shame and that's a novel in itself.  I feel like I am such a failure and a disappointment to my mom, my partner and myself. I have some sisters, 3 to be exact but it don't really matter, they aren't much better.

I know it isn't really fair to say ""IS THIS ALL I GET"" It is the cards I have been dealt, its no ones fault that I haven't done something with myself and my life, not anyones fault but my own. Have I been lazy? I think so. I also think some of it has to do with no encouragement in my younger years. I was really good at the artsy stuff in school. As a matter of fact the art classes are the only classes that I did good in and actually got a's...A+'S at that. As for all the other classes I was lucky to get D's. I had no interest in anything other than art when I was younger. Had I had encouragement who knows where I might be right now instead of here. But no matter what, how I have turned out, how my life is right now is my doing and no one else's. I could have pushed myself to go to school, to make better job choices and to do a bunch of things differently. I guess I blame myself. I have to.

He became more and more distant, he got friends, most of them were verbally abusing me, you would think he would defend me, but he backed up his friends, than his own blood, me growing up, I was (and still to this day) an introvert, and I never kept a close friend, because they would either stop talking to me, or they would say that they don't like me and for the 3 years that I have known his friends, they eventually got used to me, and we played online frequently, and 2 months ago, they disapproved of me getting a GTA Shark Card (in game currency) then they insult me saying I need to grow up, and mature, basically telling me how to run my life, and I tried to stand up for myself, but they still kept saying it Its my life, if I want to act silly, then I will, but the main focus is my cousin, and how he was brutally honest, you know how we hype up our friend to make them feel good about himself/herself? That's not what he did, every time we play online with one of his friends, he would agree and add insult to injury when his friend makes fun of me, in games... He would tell everyone to go after me, in CoD, he would tell everyone to go to his lobby because he's the ""leader"" but the sole reason I'm making this post, was the fact that he did one of, if not, the RUDEST thing ever, here's how it went it was my sister's birthday, I was texting, and he said that he's coming to the party, and I'm pretty happy, a smile stretches around my face, I say ""OK cool, :)"" an hour passes by, and he nonchalantly says, ""welp sorry I can't come, oh well"" and I ask why? And he says I don't know, now usually, most would tell the reason why can't come, or if they don't they make up something, but he all of a sudden says, I can't come I want you keep in mind that, the last time I was in his house, was 4 years ago, and he has only came over for my birthdays or sometime in the fall, so he RARELY comes to my house, and I'm not even allowed back at his house, because of personal reasons but anyway, he couldn't come to my house, but has time to go to his friends house WHENEVER he wants...

1,"How to cope with disrespectful and lying friend? HI I'm new to reddit so please bear with me So this is the situation: My friend and I often interact while playing online games as we're both huge nerds and gamers. I really enjoy spending time with her. However she has this other friend that I really dislike and I would rather play alone than put up with interacting with her friend. I have on multiple occasions expressed my discomfort with her friend and she has acknowledged it but would still invite him anyways without asking me. When that happens I usually just say sorry I don't feel like playing. Sorry for being difficult. She knows her friend will repel me. So anyways after sometime I asked if I can request not to invite him when I'm playing with her and would understand if she said no cause I realize it's a selfish request. She said it's ok no problem. So then we proceed to our routine and there's no issue whatsoever. I told her if it's too difficult to say no or your friend keeps bugging you about it I can go as I didn't want to make it difficult with my own selfishness. The problem a rise when she invited a mystery friend with different name. I suspected and knew that it was her friend that I disliked so immediately asked who that was and she said it's just a random. Not happy with her lying I went off to calm down and confronted her about it, trying to be as clear and straight to the point as I can. I expressed that what she did was hurtful and disrespectful in my point of view. I told her I'm not pleased at the fact she lied even when I called her out. So I said it's on her to resolve this issue. She replied saying there is no issue and what she did was fine. Saying it wasn't disrespectful and its not a big lie plus it was to see if I would even notice its her friend. Long story short she said if it was her she wouldn't be angry cause she's a grown up and that I'm being immature and childish by blowing things out of proportion over such joke-trivial matter. So this is more or less the situation and at the moment it's not good. As she thinks I'm in the wrong and she's right. I have considered the fact that I am wrong and have asked for an outside opinion but all my friends are just angry at how she's treating me. I understand that she can be friends with and spend time with whoever she wants. It's her life afterall. I'm not making her choose cause I know it's selfish and wrong so I'm choosing to remove myself in that situation as it's the only thing to do besides putting up with her friend. My problem is the fact that she attempted to trick me to play together with her friend and continue lying about it upon confrontation. Also by doing so I feel disrespected as she completely disregarded my feelings and opinion in the matter. I would have been perfectly fine if she told me at the start her friend wants to play and she can't really say no or she wants to play with him etc etc. In that case I'll just make myself scarce which I have no issue on doing. Instead she resorted to being deceitful with something so simple and dumb. There's quite a lot more so I'll probably update this but this is in essence more of less the situation. ",Coonioby.txt

0,"Random girl asked me awful question today. I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this or not, but I need to get this off my chest. I’ve struggled with depression for about 3 years now and I’ve had my highs and my lows. Recently I’ve been doing okay even though me and my girlfriend mutually broke up, but we’re still friends and she supports me. And my birthday is coming up soon so I was looking forward to that. Today though I decided to go to subway to get a melt and I was just standing in line when this girl walks away from her friend and up to me.

0,"I have really been trying to 'control' my rage while driving. Since being medicated it's not as bad, but I can't stop. Today this guy chased me, forced me to pull over and started yelling, I thought he would hit me. I was surprisingly calm, not even afraid. I guess I just didn't care what happened to me at that point I hate when I get so angry, go into road rage mode, because I feel like crap afterwards, I don't like myself, I usually cry. I can't talk to my husband especially about this. I feel very isolated. All he does is get mad, lecture me, tell me to stop, don't you know it's dangerous, etc. He judges and blames me. He has no idea how I feel and I doubt he ever will. I feel better now that I can come here and talk to people who will understand my feelings (even if what I did is wrong, I hope???). It's very easy to say you'll change, you'll calm down. Easier said than done. I feel like I have to hide the fact that I'm in this forum from my husband, I have to hide a lot from him. I just hope that raving lunatic doesn't come after me if he finds out where I live. I have talked to my therapist about this but not in any depth, I only get 45 minutes of her time per session.

1,"Communicating is hard I'm turning 19 this year and I want to move out of my family's house in September. Mostly for my studies, but also because I simply want to move out. I already tried last year but they found a housing for young girls managed by nuns, so I lived here for a while, but I felt uneasy the whole time. I'm heavily depressed and I had to drop out of school this year. My parents told me to come back home so that I could recover, which I did, but they don't approve of me going anywhere else to do so. For example, I feel really good in my boyfriend's family (he doesn't live with them anymore but I'm still very close to them) and wish to spend more time there, but my parents don't like the idea of not being able to give me the kind of comfort I need and find over there, so they'd rather have me stay home. I have spent as little time as possible in my parents' house recently, using every opportunity to get away, and it is understandable they don't like it. But I have always been a solitary kid, and now with my depression it became worse. I don't connect with my parents or any of my 4 siblings, and spending time with them feels like a chore. Communicating within the family is quite rough. And whenever I do try to explain how I feel, it becomes overwhelmingly clear that I'm in the wrong. It feels like whatever I say about feeling bad within the family is deflected by stating my parents and siblings' good intents. I'm sure they do mean well, but I now doubt even my own reasons for wanting anything but staying with them. I can't identify the reason why I don't feel easy with them, because they're all trying their best to help me through those tough times. I feel like an ungrateful brat. I'm not really confrontational either. I usually obey and agree to avoid stirring conflict, but this is getting tiring. If any of you has been in a similar situation, how can you open the dialogue? How can I tell my parents I don't feel good spending much time with them? In my family, direct family should come before everything. I also don't know how to talk about moving out and have a studio instead of being placed in a student housing, especially since my big sister (25) still lives at home despite having a job. It's not a matter of money either. I come from a middle class family and the housing my parent chose for me this year is much more expensive than a studio. Any advice would be welcomed. ",coglady.txt
0,"Awaiting the downward spiral. Had an awesome weekend with a whole bunch of friends from online who all came together, from all around Australia, for three days of drinking and festivities. Now I've travelled home and I'm all alone again. It's great that I have so many fantastic friends Online, but it's horrible we all live so far away. I'm already missing them terribly, and feeling down. I know that I'm about to spiral downwards even futher after having gotten drunk for three days. It's inevitable, but I'm trying to prepare. I'm going to try and draw, spend time with my Service Parrot and submerge myself in my gaming community. To keep myself as positively distracted as I can. I'm already trapped in an endless loop of thinking about my ex, who I still love and miss so much, and beating myself up. Searching for answers and ways how I could of been a better person for him. He told me he hated me and that I made him feel like a child. But i never intended for my help to make him feel like that. I tried to support and encourage him with everything. Emotionally and financially. I pushed myself to work 30+hrs a week when I was anxious and depressed because he became so closed off, so we had a roof over our head and food in our belly when we were made homeless. I tried to help him with being motivated to work, and to be able to support himself. I gave him every part of myself, because I loved him so much. And I keep holding on to things he said, before he forgot what this love really meant to him. And all the love that I gave to him, that never got into him. No matter how hard I tried. I wish he knew I don't hate him for what he said to me and that my suicide attempts weren't to make him feel guilty. I genuinely wanted to end my life. The thoughts of whatever I had done for him to hate me weighs so heavy upon me, that I fear to live with a guilt that was my own. I failed to be the person he wanted me to be, but worse; I failed to be the person I needed to be for him. Now we're 2000km apart and, Emotionally, I'm  struggling to keep my head up. Financially, I know He's struggling too. Everyone keeps teling me I shouldn't care about him, but that just makes me hate myself more, that I do.

I took the wrap for the six hits of acid we had in the car because the two of them had recently discovered they were going to have a baby.

1,"Cheap gifts on the Receiver's side My friend and I are friends for about 5 years. We ended up going to different colleges, but kept in contact online. I think of them as my best friend, but i'm not sure if it is reciprocated. Every year I stress about giving a good gift for their birthday and xmas. A gift too expensive makes them feel uncomfortable by setting expectations. A gift too cheap devalues our friendship and being on the receiving end feels terrible. I purchased their birthday gift is about $12 (Lush soap), and the Christmas gift is about $8-10 (sweets). The price of the cards are not included. They got me a small notepad that looked like it came from the dollar store for my birthday, and a couple stickers for Xmas. There was no card included or even a piece of paper that had my name on it. Last year they got me a $15 gift with the receipt for my birthday. My gifts were around the same value (~$15). I try not to place too much importance on the price tag, since it is the thought that counts, but their gift to me is really cheap (~$1-2), and looked like it was slapped together an hour before we met. I know they can afford to buy a gift. They buy coffee every couple days and bought lunch to the point where the staff remembered their order. I accepted their gift, but it was really hard to avoid showing my disappointment. I honestly thought it would of been better if they just didn't give me a gift at all. Is this a sign? Are they trying to tell me something or do they really think of me so little? I'm not sure what they are thinking or what should I do.

There are a million little strings attached to every choice you make; you can destroy your life every time you choose. But maybe you won't know for twenty years.

And even though the world goes on for eons and eons, you are only here for a fraction of a fraction of a second. Most of your time is spent being dead or not yet born. But while alive, you wait in vain, wasting years, for a phone call or a letter or a look from someone or something to make it all right. And it never comes or it seems to but it doesn't really.

0,"I am not able to do breath meditation myself, so I'm a fine one to talk, but I've read that it works. The thoughts will come, no matter what you do. Supposedly the trick with breath mediation is that it gives you distance on the thoughts, helps you ""stand back"" from them a bit, and feel the accompanying emotions but not get as carried away by them. This reinforces your ability to know that they're just thoughts, and they will go away if you don't act on them. And supposedly either with breath meditation or without, there's an element of ""fake it till you make it"" at work here. It's been shown that ""acting out anger"" as a therapeutic tool actually makes getting angry easier than letting go of it, because it maintains the neurological pathways that anger uses. One meditation teacher calls it ""rehearsing anger"". So supposedly if you replace negative thoughts/feelings with positive ones, like caring for the part of you that is angry and hurt, then eventually your brain will reprogram itself to think and feel positive things. Breath meditation has become a non-religious phenomenon in recent years, like yoga. Three books that are just good reading anyway are ""The Art of Happiness"" by the psychiatrist Howard Cutler with the Dalai Lama, ""Destructive Emotions - How Can We Overcome Them?"", by the psychologist Daniel Goleman with the Dalai Lama, and ""Anger- Wisdom For Cooling The Flames"", by Thich Nhat Hanh, all of which discuss breath meditation as a simple practice for ""mental hygiene"" as opposed to a ""religious practice"" of any sort. Supposedly the Dalai Lama was really surprised to hear that ""self-loathing"" is common in Western culture, because it was so uncommon in Tibet- there was just no concept. The point of all this is, with or without meditation, is that if you notice a negative thought or emotion when it arises, rather than struggle with it to try to put it out of your mind, you should just quietly label it as ""negative thought"" and let it go away, and/or replace it with a positive thought, like ""caring for the wounded child within you"". (It's odd to notice that John Bradshaw, the ""king"" of ""healing the wounded child"", and Thich Nhat Hanh, a Vietnamese Buddhist monk, say the same thing about this.) But it's being said that there's a great similarity between Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and meditation practice, because meditation practice recognizes negative self-talk and replaces it with positive self-talk, and supposedly conditions the brain to react in positive ways. In ""Destructive Emotions"" there's a part about brain imaging that shows that people who meditate are activating more positive parts of their brains. And again, these books are just good reading anyway. But like I say, easier said than done. Supposedly it works for some people. I can't do it, but some people can. Maybe you can. If nothing else, all these works, including Bradshaw, are good reading and you may be able to develop positive mental habits and replace the negative mental habits with them. Both breath meditation and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy have been shown to be good adjuncts to recovery from depression, even if the depression itself is being treated with medication.

0,"I'm a hetero man, 35, divorced, no kids. I can honestly say that I feel empathy towards any guy who suffers from depression. Some of my closest guy friends have admitted to me their many bouts of battling these demons, just as I've shared my horror stories and near suicidal incidents, and we all have empathy with each other over that stuff. I'm beginning to not give a crap anymore about depression being viewed as just a ""woman"" issue; it is what it is and to heck with gender stereotypes. The things I've noticed the most are my friends' unwillingness to consult a therapist or take medication, but perhaps their bouts of depression are not the ""bed-ridden"" variety that I have gone through. Or maybe this is their way of not feeling ""completely weak"". Most of my friends will either drink excessively or take drugs to deal with this stuff. I tried to drink it all away, but in the end it just made me feel worse. I tried tranquilizers, but that didn't work. I tried booze and pills together, but still the depression lingered.

1,"Help - unplanned pregnancy at 41, wife wants to keep it Hello, I need some real advice. My wife and I were married in 2011. We dated four years and the day we married was the best day of my life. We immediately became pregnant with our daughter, who is now 5. A couple of years later we welcomed our son (now almost 3). Brief introduction of us - I'm almost 41 and she almost 37. I work full time and she recently became a stay at home mom.  We are middle class, homeowners living in Seattle, college degrees, financially responsible, socially liberal on most issues, have good friend circle (many with similar aged children), good family support live in area. Both of us raised in healthy and happy traditional nuclear homes. Our traditional marriage is good and based on trust, but I won't lie and say the last 5 years of raising two children hasn't been without its challenges and occasional spat. But we married for life, and at the altar when I said I do forever, I meant it. Overall, we are fortunate and thankful for our lives. After the birth of our second child, I was done.  I had considered getting a vasectomy (snipped). Many of my dad friends had done it and recommended I do it. My wife was against it, and I wasn't really wanting to do it either for other reasons. My wife always semi-joked she wanted another kid, and had quipped she felt incomplete and that being a mother is her calling.  She is an excellent, patient mother to our children.  However, I felt it was a phase and she could get her ""baby fix"" with friends newborns.  I did not feel a need to have another child, and was quite against it. I was frank with her on the matter, but because of the differing opinion and emotional confrontation, we avoided discussing it at length. Fast forward to 2 weeks ago when my wife informs me she missed her period and sure she is pregnant. No visits to the doctor yet to confirm, but we have never had problems conceiving, and I believe she is pregnant.  Our birth control was her counting her monthly cycle, which she is pretty good at.  I always reached for a condom just in case, but she does not like using them and told me it was not needed. Well we slipped one past the goalie. When she told me, I reacted poorly, saying it would mess up the good thing we had going, I was tired and didn't have the energy, our family was complete already.  Not to mention the fact that it was be financially very difficult (we'd have to buy a larger house and I don't need to tell you what Seattle real estate is like). We are quite squeezed in our little home already. I told her she would have to go back to work. I asked her to terminate the pregnancy. To sum it up, it wasn't the reaction she was hoping to hear. The next week I bounced between many emotions. Anger, for upsetting our lives, even considering the idea she intentionally got pregnant. Fear, that our stable little family might crumble, that 3 makes an odd man out and the children would suffer. Fear, that she isn't healthy for this, as she is showing some physical ailments/breakdown that shouldn't be ignored and having another child will only fixing those off further. Fear, that I'm suffering physical ailments as well and don't have the energy to go through another round of caring for an infant. Fear, that both her parents and mine are elderly and close to needing care from us, and that they won't be there to be the ""relief valve"" and help with watching the kids when we need it. Anxiousness, that we had just got out of having the kids in diapers and were just starting the ""next phase"" of our children being autonomous and doing activities I could participate in. Guilt, for crushing her dreams and not supporting the idea of a third child when its something she wants very badly. One day I wrote out an objective list of reasons (many of which are cited above) why having a third child was a bad idea. After a few more days of trying to ignore the issue, we had our blowup.  I presented her my list and she listened, acknowledging they were valid and made sense. She then countered with her belief that this was meant to be, and she could not in good conscious have an abortion. It would stay with her forever and she says she would never get over it, and would forever resent me for pushing the issue.  I told her I might resent the child and her for letting this happen.   I slept on the couch that night, feeling disgust and bitterness. The next morning there was nothing else to do but discuss it more. I again said I wasn't interested, and she can't force this on me. She again countered with her same argument that it was meant to be, that our ""next phase"" of children would just have to wait a few more years.  I yelled I would be almost 60 years old at this child's high school graduation. I want to play sports with my kids and be active, not the ""old dad"". I said I wouldn't care, not even over the name we would give it. I said I wound't go with her to the doctor appointment.  I told her she was being selfish and not putting what she has now over what she might have. She told me she would start contacting a divorce lawyer if this was how it was going to be. It's only been a few days since that talk, but I am completely stunned and not myself.  I was a zombie at work, not able to focus on anything. At home I've been short tempered and avoiding everything.  I've cried in my car, cried in the bathroom. Borderline panic attacks.  I'm frantically researching mental health professionals, as I need to talk to someone. I haven't seen a counselor since before we were married.  I can't talk to my family or friends until the doctor visit to confirm the pregnancy.  I feel like an absolute asshole for saying the things I said and my attitude, and I can't take that back. Even if it isn't a viable pregnancy, or she miscarries, I've made my mark and she will always think less of me. I'm scared she regrets even having ever met me.  I absolutely DO NOT want to break up our family, I love my children and family. I am certain a divorce would ruin all of us. We are at an absolute impasse. She is set in her mind, the only thing that could stop this is the doctor saying she or the baby are not healthy and viable. I'm beside myself. It's not that I don't love children, I really do. And I know I'll still love the child regardless, it's not the child's fault and they should not be treated unfairly. And she may be right, that it is only raising another baby is temporary and it'll pass and everything will be OK and we will all be happier. But what if it's not? What if this was a bad idea and our quality of life is destroyed? What if I do resent her, or she resents me because of my opinion.

1,"Well tonight things finally came to a collapse. Erika has finally decided she can't try and hold on to what we have had going for over 3 years. After a long talk on the phone, and her broken down in tears, many kind words exchanged back and forth, a little bit of laughter now and then, but mostly silence, trying to decide what to say. She has decided to stick with Troy because he is there for her, since i live 8 hours away. My heart was broken, after 3 years of keeping it going. I will cherish the last time i saw her, only 3 weeks ago, driving 8 hours leaving at 1 in the morning on a spur of the moment to go see her because my parents were out of town. Spending a whole day, and night with her was the most amazing thing i have ever experienced. After cuddeling all night, and falling asleep, we woke up early in the morning, and both started getting closer. Eventually, we ended up making sweet love for the first time which is the most amazing thing i have ever experienced with her. Only a few hours later i had to go home. Then, tonight, i found out that the big pit i was feeling in my stomach the other night was true. This past weekend she went and did it with Troy....I cant explain how i felt. I know they were dating but i was shocked. We talked some more, trying to work things out, but you know it doesnt work out that great. Both said a few things we shouldnt. She wanted to try and get rid of our emotions for each other, she said all her stuff, then i asked her if she really wanted me to say how i felt, and she said yes. After a long time of me talking, she was shocked of how much i really felt for her because this was truely the first time i was able to tell her i dreamed, and wanted to marry her someday. But, i was too late. She is with troy for the past couple months, if only i could have told her sooner my true feelings, but i didnt; now i am too late to care for her, she said its over forever. Hopefully i will still be able to talk to her. Night ended with a long silence, i could hear her crying in the background, a long silence, and the line goes dead. I am dieing, and really need to talk to her, call once, twice, 5 times, 7 times, 4 voicemails later, i give up, give one last call to tell her sweet dreams and have a good day at school. Then i head to the gym to try and work off some of what this night has brought. I have decided to write down the Soap Opra we have had for the past 3 years...... ",4336871.000000000.male.17.txt

She asked me to explain further, but I couldn't find the words to better express that perspective. She then proceeded to recount to me all of the myriad ways she's nearly died on some of the trips she's taken. I confessed that I couldn't really relate to those sorts of situations or how they've affected her, as she has more zeal for life than anyone I've ever met. Whatever she was describing about perceived proximity to death didn't suit me. Then the words came to me. I feel as if I'm living on borrowed time, because I feel like I could, at any moment, lose what little will to live I have left. It's like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop. I see it in slow-motion, slowly falling to the cold pavement, but I don't know when it will finally make contact. In the meantime, I'm existing, trying to experience new things and connect to people as much as I am able to, but I can't shake the conviction that I'll eventually resolve to leave by my own hand, despite whatever life I've made for myself.

As of the last 2 months they have been unactive (We only talk online and see each other from time to time), not talking to me, saying they get bored of our conversation, never starting a conversation. And never consider to invite me to hangout, they just do it for themselves. I'm not sure how to feel anymore, when I am in person with them we have tons of fun, and sometimes when we talk the conversations are really interesting and fun too. I always feel uneasy and not comfortable about them... So what should I do? If you want more details as for something ask for it. ",MichFrt.txt
1,"How to drift away from a 'best friend' you don't like anymore? I have a friend, and I am trying to put distance between us. They're generally a nice person (but do some mean things occasionally), but they're quite... boring. Okay, very boring. I don't even know how I have been able to put up with the lack of interesting conversation for the past 2 years. I need a best friend with whom I can laugh about fun stuff and not just talk about SCHOOL. Let's call them B. B has clung to me for the past 2 years, so they don't have any other friends. I have loads of other friends, but they all assume that I'm best friends with B, so they don't make an effort to include me in their friendship group. I've told quite a few of them, and they are giving me some advice on what to do, but I want to see what all of you say. For the past few weeks, I have been making it quite clear that I don't really want to talk to B. I give them short answers as replies, don't make eye contact or initiate conversations and I have generally been ignoring them. I know it sounds mean, but I've had enough. I can't deal with clingy people. However, B is either EXTREMELY OBLIVIOUS, or they are just being really stubborn. Also, even though I am ignoring B, I sit next to them in lots of lessons, and I also hang out in the same room as them at break and lunch so they always come and shuffle next to me! SO. INFURIATING. I don't want to change rooms, because then I won't be with my friends. Another thing is that if I ignore B, I actually look like a loner. I ignore them by being antisocial in the corner doing my homework most of the time. I mean, everyone in my school already thinks I'm sort of weird child that studies all of the time, because I always seem to be studying at school (which is actually because I don't do anything at home). I also have to eat by myself at lunch, and having social anxiety definitely doesn't help with that. I know I shouldn't care about that, but it's hard not to. I went off on a tangent there, didn't I? So basically, what I'm trying to ask you is that should I completely completely ignore B (e.g. don't talk to them at all) or is that too mean? (Please don't suggest anything that says to try and be friends with them, because I don't want to do that. I want to make exciting friendships that I will remember, and not be stuck with... a boring person. Also, I'm 14. I don't know if that will help, but meh.) B has turned into one of those people that... you just want to punch in the face for no reason. Do you sort of get what I mean? Anyway, thanks for listening to this ranty thing.

I started reading some of the blogs and since I've been so lonely lately, I decided to try to write some of things that come to my mind. One of the things that I can start talking about is how my life has change from last year. Now I'm single again. I got a divorce. I can't say all the fault was his but mostly yes, he cheated on me. I think the hardest part has past. Now I need to look forward and try not to think about ...what if? I did everything possible to save my marriage, because I have a little daugther and I wanted her to have a family ...forever. The same way I did when I was single (the first time). I'm so lucky to have the parents I have and the sisters I have. Now I appreciate all the efforts that both my parents did to keep us all together and happy.  (Today is the birthday of one of my sisters, by the way) So, the point is that all the perspectives I had about life changed with this tragic episode in my life. Really, everything I believed before is kind of ...gone. I just hope that divorce is not the same for everyone, because mine has been hard mostly probably because of the relegion beliefs I had. I said I had cause now everything looks so different. I'm so happy for all the people that has found love, true love, now I realize that having someone to share your time and ideas is one of the most imnportant things we can have, more than money. (Of course money always helps). Sometimes I think if I will be able to trust again, you know as a partner and find someone that I can count on. Someone to grow old and have wonderful memories, Do you think is there such a person for me?

1,"Is my dad enabling my mom? I have posted on multiple subs about my turbulent relationship with my mom, and I feel like I am afraid of her. I've gotten to a point where I jump when the garage door opens and she comes home from work. I think have become so irrationally afraid of my mom, that fear manifested today when I was going to pick my brother up from work and saw my mom coming the other way. I freaked out and ended up rear-ending another car, totaling mine (I am not hurt, don't worry.) Needless to say, this whole situation has caused chaos in my house and I am terrified to ever get behind the wheel again. Tonight my dad called me out on me calling my mom ""abusive"" a few weeks ago. Bear in mind, neither she nor my dad has ever laid a finger on me, but my mom has emotionally abusive tendencies. She has said things to me that have fucked me up more than she can understand. Here's a short list of some things she's done: * If guilt tripping were an Olympic sport, let's just say she'd be Michael Phelps. * She likes to ask me what's wrong when I'm upset and when I tell her, she cuts me off and says ""I don't want to talk about it."" * She has criticized my weight for as long as I can remember. In her defense, her two sisters are 500 pounds apiece will both probably die before they reach 60, so she just wants me to be healthy and live long. But she's not helping. She's only making me want to cry into a Chipotle bowl. * She liked comparing me to my best friend in high school (""Why can't you be more like her? She studies and gets good grades!"") Still does sometimes. * To this day, she pesters me about my lack of religion. I remember when I was 11 and didn't want to go to Sunday School, she was like ""Do you want to be a heathen and go to hell?"" A couple years ago, she told me ""I just want you to go to Heaven when you die."" She even pestered me a week ago about having demons in my head. * I thought I could confide in her about my sexuality but she quickly shot me down with ""How do you know? You've never been on a date before. That doesn't mean you're bi/gay!"" She also told me I am asexual and she's pretty much gaslighted me about my sexuality to the point where I don't know whether I am gay or straight anymore. * I was diagnosed with Aspergers and ADHD when I was a kid and she's basically used that diagnosis to keep me in a little bubble. I didn't get drivers' license until 18, didn't get my first job until 20, and I'm still perpetually single... all because my mom has used my diagnoses as a crutch. She still does, and after the accident, I don't fucking blame her! Whenever I try to tell him about the things my mom says, he says things like ""What's wrong with motivating you to get better grades?"" or ""Your mom doesn't want you to end up like your sisters that she is going to bury because they're 500 pounds."" My mom is my bully, and he is her apologist. I don't how much of this (if anything) constitutes abuse, but my dad doesn't buy any of it and blames it on ""liberal millennial indoctrinated safe-space snowflake bullshit... abuse is broken bones, black eyes and cigarette burns on arms."" He goes on about how he and mom have done everything for me and how there is something in my sick, twisted mind that is confusing ""constructive criticism"" with ""abuse."" Deep down, I am beginning to resent my parents, because they *have* done everything for me, sheltered me and spoiled me to the point where I don't know how the world outside my little bubble works. I am 23 now and don't feel any better off now than I did when I was ten years ago. There are certain life skills I don't have because they did everything for me. I don't feel like I've ever had to work for anything and I hate them for it. They tried to be tougher with me but didn't have the spine. They never forced me to do anything except go to summer camps for special needs kids, they pretty much just let me raise myself and it's costing all of us dearly. Tonight is the night my real life begins. Basically, if I am so afraid of my mom that seeing her on the road freaks me out to the point of an accident, something in our relationship has gone south. I don't know if it's her or me anymore. ",carlykerfuffle.txt

1,"""You can count on me"" That sweet lie. Maybe this post is a way to vent. Maybe I just need to feel like someone, somwhere has read this and, in a way, I've actually said it. I don't have many friends, but the ones I do have, I consider them quite close. One of them (let's cal him Joel) is by far the one whom i have a closest relationship with we are bouth 30 right now. I met him as the boyfriend of a workmate about 7 years ago and even after they broke up we stayed as friends. Joel has a tendency for depression, and I've always tried to help him in any way possible. Because of this problem he ended up hooked on Cocaine, he admited it to me, and we tried everything possible to solve it. So far he seems to be dealing with it reasonably well, but I've had some very rough nights in which i would recieve a text message, wake up at 4 am, grab my keys and drive to his home to literally hold him in my hands while he cried back to sleep and then sand the rest of the night outside his bedroom's door. Basically, When I say the words ""You can count on me for anything"" I really mean it, and I think I've proved that to him. Fast forward to last May and, for the first time in many, many years (before i even met him) I was hit with depression myself for various reasons. It hit me hard, suicide attempt hard. I tried to deal with it by myself, but finally turned to him and told him what was happening during what I consider the worst night so far in my life. The night I hugged my dog, left him at a friends house ""for a few days because i had to leave the city for work"" and drove to the forest with the intention of not comming back. In that forest I called Joel in tears, told him whats was happening to me (didnt tell him what i was planning) and he literally said ""I feel bad i can't go there, but I had promissed someone else I havent seen in a while to hang out tonight"" but told me I ""could count on him for whatever I needed"". To say I was shocked would be an understatement. Obviously I didnt end my life that day, but I could not believe what had happened. I tried to ignore it, called Joel the very next day and asked him to meet me whenever it was possible. This was in May. I would not see Joel's face until September 2nd after basically begging him to meet up. I'm writing this on November 26, and we have met once since then, a day I had to beg for again in which i planned to tell him how I was dealing with my problem. He invited a girlfriend he just met and a co-worker to said meeting. I find myself thinking about this every day, about how a person can be so selfish to have a friend, someone temselves call his best friend, in this situation and proceed to ignore it and basically run away. After all we have been through this situation is hurting me far more than the reasons that nearly drove me to suicide some months ago. I want to tell something to everyone who has taken the time to read this. **Never say ""You can count on me"" if you dont mean it,** you may think you do, but consider if you are actually up to the task. Because,** a failure in this regard can completely crush someone's spirit far more than any problem they needed help with in the first place.** ",Mahkbin.txt

Right before the cops came she was arguing with my dad and told me to ""Shut the f*** up! The cops arrived I told one of the cops my side of the story and she told hers. She said that I attacked her and that there were scratch marks on both her arms. I told the cops how could that be when none of the nails on my right hand are very short (I swear to you I couldn't have scratched seeing since I had no nails on one hand. The nails on my right hand are VERY short because they all broke due to cleaning the kitchen cabinets etc). The cops didn't believe me. My sister also claimed that I'm ""bipolar"" which I'm not. So the cops believed my sister and took me away on a 5150. I was released 3 hours later because the case manager said I didn't have any mental health issues. The funny thing is that I told my parents that I wanted permission to use their car to leave that house because I couldn't handle the stress that came with living with her. I would eventually return the car once I moved, got myself established etc. The stress has caused me to lose 3 pounds this week alone. After returning from the behavior health services, I gathered  my bag and one suitcase and left. Currently, I'm staying at a hotel. What hurts most of all is that my parents have never told my sister to stop telling me to kill myself. It's as if thy don't care. This is such a shitty experience that I wouldn't wish upon anyone. I'm a hotel with no car, no friends, no home. Is it bad that to think that I just wanted my parents to tell her to stop telling me to kill myself. I feel like I'm asking for a lot. What do you guys think? ",Lachaca02.txt

0,"I'm actually feeling a little bit like a fraud at the moment, because I've read so many different topics today and realized that there are people who have suffered far more than I have. I've joined this site, to start to try and get some help for myself and to talk about the things that have caused me to feel like this over the last few years. My doctor has told me that I'm depressed and prescribed tablets, but I refuse to believe this and have not taken them. I know that this is wrong, but I hate the idea of being labeled depressed. Before I went to university, I was happy, adventurous, nothing could keep me down. I was in a fantastic relationship, but then I moved into halls, in a flat with six others, who I absolutely adored. One of them in particular, who I fell in love with. Little did I know that he had also fallen for me in the same way, but we were both so shy and I was in a relationship, that neither of us did anything about it ...... until we moved into a house together in our second year with 3 others. This is when everything went wrong. We were always close, really close in fact, and I admitted to him that I kept getting urges to kiss him, hold him and never let him go. He felt the same way as I did, but still nothing was done by either of us. Then one evening we were both out, getting drunk with friends, we found ourselves alone when we got back to the house and kissed. I've never felt like I did that night since. I didn't care about anything around me. We were the only 2 people in the world at that moment. The next morning, we were both a bit bemused and didn't know what to say / do, so pretended like nothing had happened. The end of term came and we had just moved in to another house with the same people, but were all going home for the summer. I was devastated knowing that we wouldn't see each other until september. I began to resent my boyfriend who I was still with and my family were going through problems because of my father. When september came, I went straight onto my final teaching placement, which meant up at 530 work all day, home, eat ,work and then in bed by 11pm. I was tired all the time and didn't have the energy to go out in the week, but He was always there for me, and yes, we were still pretending like nothing had happened. After the christmas of my final year, I decided to party like never before. It was great, but there was still the issue of him. By now I had been trying to convince myself that I was still in love with my boyfriend, purely because I didn't have the guts to leave him and be on my own. How pathetic was that. Anyway, we went out to the union for a major drinking session, danced like a couple, felt like a couple, got back to the house and one thing led to another. We ended up sleeping together in his room, he initiated it. It was amazing. However the next day we were so confused that we didn't speak for 2 days, until I told him how I really felt. That I had been in love with him since my first year, but couldn't do anything about it, that I was going mad inside because I wanted him so much. He returned my feelings. From then on, we were inseparable, but to anyone who saw us together, we were just 2 very very close friends, who lived in each others' pockets. We were having an affair of sorts and living a lie, but we found comfort in each other and couldn't let it go. I know how wrong it was, believe me I do, and I would be devastated if it ever happened to me. We left university in the june of 2004. It was the worst time of my life. I felt like I was losing part of me, and was never going to get it back. Before we left and before the lie really started, I had agreed to move in with my boyfriend in leeds for his final year. I didn't want to do this anymore, but was too chicken to say no, so this went ahead and for the last year, july 04 until now, I have been living with my boyfriend. Things have not been good and I have still been seeing Him (from university) as often as I can. The most recent one was a couple of days ago. We have both joked about running away, children, marriage, but neither of us has got the guts to do anything. It is so wrong and has made my life so difficult, putting on a brave face for friends and family, pretending that I'm happy all of the time. I don't think I can do it much longer. One last thing, while all of this was going on in my life, my dad was causing mayhem at home. I was being pushed and pulled between the 2 people that I thought could get through anything and that were truly in love. How wrong can you be. I was like a piece of meat being fought over by 2 animals. They constantly bitched about each other to me, leaving me with no - one to talk to. I found myself being dragged further and further down in to a pit which I can't get out of. I'm in love with Him, but will not leave my boyfriend for fear of being alone, I resent my father for what he has done, I resent my mother for being callous, there is no - one that I have told this to over the past 4 years, nobody who I felt that I could really trust. I don't know what to do anymore. I cry at the smallest thing, hate things changing at all, but most of all, I can't see the point of going on anymore. I just want these feelings to end. My one savior has been my work, teaching children. caring for others and helping them make the most of their lives makes me feel like I'm doing something worthwhile. I'm not expecting any replies, I just needed someone / thing to listen. ",bubble83_e_2_a_c4_uk.txt

1,"Friend leads much better life, I feel resentful We both just graduated, she had so many job offers,  I had none save for an internship. I found a job later but I make less than half of what she makes. She got a job offer from another firm, and referred me to them when she turned them down, but I didn't get it even though the interview went great. And because she makes so much more than I do, she's always trying to get me to travel, which I can't afford since I'm saving up for grad school.  She's also currently in a relationship, and has tried to set me up with people but it never works. She's a great friend but she makes me feel so inadequate. I'm begining to become resentful and envious, and I don't want to be a toxic person to be around.

I can't understand how these kids are just walking around firing their AKs as if they are hanging out after school. You don't tend to see the other side but I assume it's the same. There was a shot of a group of kids nonchalantly lounging around on the back of a pickup truck upon which was mounted an old-fashioned looking heavy machine-gun, the kind with an armored shield and mounted on a pivot, maybe a mobile anti-aircraft gun. The truck wasn't moving, the gun was in use. So why were a bunch of kids just sitting there? Don't human beings usually seek to protect themselves from danger? Why do people involved in a fire fight walk around as if they were popping out to the shops for a six pack and a box of 200 B & H?

What do you do when everything you were told turned out to be bullshit and you realize that everyone you know is deluded? I have started to experience intense rages which appear to be provoked by my girlfriend, who, it seems, thinks that the purpose of a relationship is to psychoanalyze one's partner destructively, to the point of inducing a breakdown. Or something. I have lashed out at her, hitting and screaming and have, during intense screaming matches, to beat my fists against the wall. This is the best I can do to prevent myself from smashing her to pieces. My right hand still hurts me from a couple of days ago. She closes the windows to try to spare the neighbors any unpleasantness. God knows what they must think. Like I could give a fuck. I am inconsiderate, I am selfish, I am a bastard, I have a cold attitude to others, I am a snob, I have contempt for everyone. I don't know which is my stuff and which is hers. I am thinking more of suicide these days. I used to have the regular teenage fascination with my mortality and the potential termination thereof. We were going to try for a baby but she has a hormonal condition which seems quite serious. I have to go wank in a jar and see if my tadpoles are doing whatever it is they should do. She wants me to consider going off with another woman to procreate if it turns out she is infertile. This fills me with rage. I will not tell you why.

I wouldn't have known the true, judgmental, and frankly I have no fucking idea where in the ass of God did they pull all their judgmental shit - if I hadn't snooped and read text messages of my mother to other people. Hell, my own mother's in it, too! ""Hide the knife, he might stab our son (my stepfather)."" ""You're sick, go to a doctor for a checkup. You can't give up, please don't die. We pity your son.

I've confirmed EVERYTIME, that family is my main source of toxicity. FUCK THAT. I'm being ganged up on by everyone in this house, and their relatives, and every single one of my relatives. I once questioned if I was the one at fault. I mean, if EVERYBODY hated you, you're probably doing something wrong. UNLESS, you're just that damn unlucky and every single one of your relative is a fucking asshole. I've heard of those stories before, so it isn't impossible - and I think that's the case with me.

1,"Am I being too harsh? I have a cousin(we'll call him Joe) who is the closest thing I have ever had to a best friend.  We used to do everything together.  Throughout the years we would party our asses off in college, spend holidays together, play video games; literally everything together.  About a year ago, I started to notice that he was making some bad life choices.  Particularly, these bad choices involved drinking and driving, pushing relationships away, and hanging out with the wrong type of people.  At first, it didn't really affect our friendship.  We've always respected each others separate lives when we weren't hanging out.  It was when I started to notice the changes mentioned above that I started to bring it up.  One weekend, the whole friendship imploded. Some of my friends were coming into town.  Joe was friends with them as well, so I was planning a great time for all of us.  Friday, we went out to a local bar and were all having fun.  Joe has a girlfriend, who wasn't able to join us until the following Saturday morning due to work obligations.  They had been dating for about 3 months, and Joe had been constantly pushing her away, pretending he didn't care about her when I thought she was a stand up gal that could really help him.  That Friday night, Joe ends up making out with an ugly, fat, unnattractive old acquaintenance of ours.  I confronted Joe and told him to cut the shit or I would knock his ass out.  He stopped messing around with the girl and pretended everything was fine.  I confronted him, calling him out for how he chooses to make his life miserable with his actions.  I forced him to tell his girlfriend what he did.  After sending the text, he drove home drunk from the bar. The next day, Saturday, my friends, Joe, and I all met up at a local event in my hometown.  Joe apologized to me and said he was glad I was there to make things right.  I forgave him and we proceeded to have a great time at the event(which is basically just a big tailgate party).  Near the end of the day, Joe's girlfriend was finally able to show up and join the festivities.  She didn't seem bothered by his actions of the previous night, which made me happy because Joe needed someone like her in his life.  Well, as the evening continued, Joe wouldn't stop drinking.  I kept telling him to take it easy, but it was in his head that he wanted to keep the party going at any rate. That evening, Joe ditched me and everyone in the group, including his girlfriend, to go to the bars with some random people he met at the local event.  We were all there together, and then he disappeared, gone without a trace or text.  He told his girlfriend to wait in a near by parking lot while he finished partying.  She ended up calling me, crying, asking me to help her find him.  I tried to call Joe multiple times, and was ignored and sent to voicemail.  At this point, I'm full of rage from his actions now and the night prior.  Why would he treat me, his ""best friend"", and his girlfriend like this?  I text him, saying how upset I am and that he needs to be a man and figure his life out becuase he's pushing those closest to him away.  Later that night(around 2AM), I get calls from people at the local event that know me saying that he is making out with random chicks again and eventually was arrested by the police.  They're telling me to come get him before the police take him to jail.  I refuse.  Turned out he didn't actual get arrested(so he claimed), I've never found out the truth of that night. It's been over a year since I've talked to him.  I don't answer his calls or reply to his texts.  When I go home to my local town, he always texts me and says he wants to come over and visit or that he wants to meet up.  He pretends that his actions didn't completely ruin our friendship.  I demand that he holds himself accountable and changes his lifestyle.  I won't respond to him until he has acknowledged how he has acted and makes an attempt to fix the problem: drinking alchohol and pretending we(closest people in his life) mean nothing to him. My question:  Am I being too harsh?  Treating him like this breaks my heart.  He was my best friend, we had promised to be each other's best men in our weddings.  I don't know any other way for him to recognize how awful of a person he has become and to help him learn that he can't live his life like this. ",eatmynads.txt

My background:My mother was an OMS for many years and retired in 2002. I never lived with her overseas but the kids and I did get to visit Addis, Dhahran, Riyadh, Barbados. She was always after me to take the FSWE so I did twice in the early 90's.  I didn't pass either time so I thought it wasn't meant to be. I became the teacher I always dreamed of being.   Well, life changes.  My oldest son was in college and after 9/11, he decided he wanted to make a difference and following grandma's lead, he wanted to join the FS.  He wanted me to take the FSWE with him for moral support.  Guess who passed?  Me.  I went to orals the first time in Nov and only scored a 5.1.  My son and I, along with another son had already signed up to take the FSWE again.  Guess who passed this time?  Me, again.  This time I did orals in July and received a 5.9.  Took forever to get my clearances through but then I made the register.  I was offered the June A-100 class but had the last class of my master's to finish so I declined. They then offered me September.    Did I really want to do this?  That has been the million dollar question! Or in the case of the FS, maybe the hundred dollar question. Do I want to leave my kids, have my husband leave his career, just to try something I may not like?  I have gone forward and taken all the steps but I still have days of doubt.

I'm so happy, now we've got finals to do. What fun. I've got Japanese and Computer Literacy. We did nothing at school today whatsoever. It was really retarded, but it was fun, cause the teachers were somewhat intimidated and forked over tons of candy in a last ditch to maintain some semblance to order.  It worked.  During Science, M*rr*s (take that Google!) was a meanyhead, making me take the darn remote and fast forward through commercials, then count field trip money, then do this, and that, and so forth. Me no like M*rr*s. Oh well. SHE'S GONE FOREVER FROM MY LIFE AFTER THIS. I'm so freakin' happy.  History was kinda' stupid, but Micah and I chased each other around, and Ms. Yi got pissed. Japanese was kool, cause Austin and I got to sumo wrestle or something like it. Everyone was goofing off. It was awesome.  CS, I was locked in a room with Sm*th for a whole period. I was scared. He's still pissed at me, I think. Here's where background is required. He was dissing Mozilla (!), and how they were heralding ThunderBird as the next generation of email thing. Then he proceeds to diss all of Mozilla, including Composer and FireFox. Then, the final straw, he calls ThunderBird FireBird. So I tell him he's wrong and tell him that FireBird was the 1st generation of the  FireFox browser. He just kinda' stares at me. So I'm not sure whether he was really, really pissed or amazed that someone as computer illiterate as me would know that.  Skipping all other classes, I get to English with B*l*sta, 8th Period.

1,"i think i have a fairly violent and destructive nature, the other day i saw a work line of ants crossing this little path in my garden, you know all in a little line carrying leaves and other small pieces of debris to there nest.   so i decided- without conscious control or empirical decision making- to follow the line and find this magical nest of ants and well, to destroy them. its not as if im a child still so there was no real explorative adventure kiddy stuff, just the pleasure of destroying their city.  so i went to the garage- found a high pressure vacuum suction hose attachment and pressurised some diesel fuel into there home, i was quite surprised as about a gallon went in, along with a flaming book of matches- and i threw a bible in just for good measure- good kindling really, nice thin pages. anyway so this massive jet of fire shoots out and almost cooks me, and the most satisfying part was that NO ants came back out, i let the ones working in the chain across the path live just so they could go and tell the other colonies what had happened.  i was quite disturbed by the enjoyment i got out of the whole thing, but well the world is full of wierdo's that do a lot more worse stuff, so im ok, right?

0,"I might be feeling this way, because I demand too much from myself. I made a similar post about how it could be a sleep problem, but I have a lot of thoughts in my head, so let me share this, and comment if you think you relate. Basically, I don't want to settle for what my life is right now. I don't want to accept a cheap, easy job. I don't want to accept my poor mental health, and I don't want to take any of the medicine I'm given. I don't want to live with my parents. I think my mom's not smart, and my step-dad has always been an angry alcoholic. I remember the feeling that he hated me ever since my childhood, but then I think he has trouble understanding people. I don't want to be any of the things I hate, and I became very hateful ever since that feeling and the mind fog started. I don't know. I felt like I'd type more, but it all revolves around money and things I hate about myself and other people. I just hate the life I have. I feel like I'm in a terrible mindset. It's a mindset that doesn't let me grow, but makes me think I should try as hard as I can to. I also feel insufferably tired lately, hence the sleep issues post on /r/getting_over_it.

0,"I've lost 4 Marines to depression and almsost lost a 5th. None saw combat. I need help understanding. Hi. I just had my 4th funeral in 7 years for yet another Marine. A few days ago another one called me with a gun to his head and i talked him down. These 5 Marines, as far as i can tell suffer/suffered from depression. Pretty much every one of them was intelligent (like way too smart for the Marine Corps) and each of them stood out as ""the funny one"". To say very few people understood they were struggling would be an understatement. The Marine Corps has done a lot to try and help suicidal Marines, but all our training videos depict some ""clearly distressed"" person telegraphing an intent to harm themselves. In reality none of these people let on the depth of their suffering and only one made an attempt to seek help. What I'm asking: As someone who has never suffered depression (Ive been ""depressed"" but that was from external factors like a job not working out or a girl leaving me. I consider that normal human emotion), how do I identify Marines under my care thst may be suffering and need help. They are NOT giving the outward signs in the stupid ""Lance Corporal Decker video"" we watch once a year. Thanks. Edit: been at work all day then went to visit a former Marine that dealt with some serious issues in his day but is doing well now. Mulled over a lot of this with him, then checked back in here and saw all these wonderful responses. I have read every one, some several times. I have a lot to consider and learn, but thank you for helping me find some direction. One thing i didn't mention is my role in all this. Im not sone big wig commander with tools at my disposal.  Im a newly promoted Sergeant and a squad leader with just a handful of guys under me. The one we just burried was not in my platoon, but i knew him enough to be deeply saddened by his loss. The other three were guys i was close to back in training, but i was not currently stationed with them when it happened. In fact i found out about all three of them on Facebook. This recent one, and the one that called me with suicidal thoughts, have made me want to be much more aware of the mental health of those around me. The scary thing to me is, even with hindsight, i wouldn't have picked these five guys out of the lot as having ANY kind of issues, let alone suicidal tendencies. I have also noticed, maybe because of my nature or leadership style, that im the one people tend come to with problems. I make it known that im here for that purpose, and people take me up on it. So I guess now i want to make sure i can spot when someone needs more help than they may be openly asking for. I will be more vigilant in my assessments of the needs of those under my watch. Thank you all for the detailed and informed replies. ",robinson217.txt

1,"My mom went to go to a family gathering (I didn't go) and one of my aunt's seems to have forgotten my name. Is it reasonable to be bothered by this? I don't see my dad's side of the family that much after I moved because its a long commute. However we still send out Christmas  cards and two of them call from time to time. One of my Aunts was having a retirement party and my mom went to it out of obligation more than out of wanting to. The Aunt who the party was for was welcoming and nice to her but the rest were just talking amongst themselves about politics and other crap. One of my other Aunts who lives outside of the area (compared to us and the others) went up to my mom and said hi to her but when she asked about me she said ""How's your daughter?"".  Everyone else who asked about me asked about me by name,so my mom took notice of this and found it odd. She told me about it when she got home and it bothered me. I was the flowergirl in the wedding for this particular Aunt, so I don't see how she could not even remember my name anymore.  Is it reasonable to be bothered by this? I used to send them christmas cards (and I signed my name) but they haven't sent anything back in recent years. I don't feel like bothering to even try now.

1,"I heard about a couple of jobs at work I applied for the other day. I didn't receive an interview. I'm pretty dissappointed about it, I thought my application was quite good... I was never expecting to get either of the jobs, there are people at work who definitely deserve them more than I but it is still a sensation not dissimiliar to a kick in the teeth. All my friends rallied around to make me feel better but of course when you feel like that there is very little someone can do to help. It's a matter of stewing for a few days and then getting over it, I am becoming a master this year it seems. I offered my application to my friends at work for there opinion, they all said it was pretty good, but I only got a truly honest opinion from one, my good friend anthony, he told me that while it was good, I used passive language which they warn you against, I really appreciate his honesty, you have to respect it. I think he might be one of those friends you meet rarely that you should try and hold on to for the rest of your life.. you can't waste a good friend. I actually feel the bunch of guys I've met in the last couple of years while working where I am, are the best I have ever made, they are not like some of the friends I had in high school who seem to use when appropriate and forget you at other times and I honestly don't think they ever thought about it, or the friends they are unwilling or just unable to share any emotions deeper than a bottle of beer with you.. at some point you must grow up.  I was told by Anthony the other day when he read this for the first time that adnd is an old acronym for Dungeons and Dragons dating back to 2nd Edition and that die-hards upon reading my first post would pick me up on it... and I have to say if that is so, then you really must start doing something more than dnd with your life, okay!

I am the opposite of this. When good things happen I feel good. When bad things happen I feel bad. I loved what you said about there being no such thing as self loathing in Tibet.

I wasn't taking money from them or anything (I don't live with my parents, and my husband has a great job and I don't technically HAVE to work)  but now that I've come clean about it my mother says she feels ""manipulated.""

1,"I'm trying to understand a couple of things of wildly different importance.  First post is baseball.  Major League Baseball's insistence that their All-Star game decide which league receives the privelege of home field advantage in the World Series is ridiculous.  This policy blows my mind.  There are so many inequities in allowing a collection of individuals from different teams to come together and decide an important post-season rule such as home field advantage.  First of all, as evidenced by last night's debacle, one person's failure can crush an entire league's hopes.  Roger Clemens comes in and lays an egg and the next thing you know the National League doesn't have a chance.  This year's example is particularly strange, since A.L. batters came into the game with the luxury of having faced Clemens multiple times—something most N.L. hitters could not say about their encounter with Mark Mulder to start the game.  Also, because of MLB's insistence that at least one player from each team be represented, players with no real vested interest in which league gets home field advantage are deciding the outcome.  I doubt Livan Hernandez is particularly concerned with the post-season this year.  So if he faces someone like Derek Jeter, the stakes are unequal to the point of unfairness.  Another thing about all of the ""This Time it Counts"" garbage is the fact that the game is still played like an exhibition.  If the game is really supposed to count, then I want Barry Bonds in for the whole game.  I don't want Roger Clemens pitching on a couple hours of sleep because of all of his All-Star festivity obligations.  I want Mike Piazza, not Johnny Estrada (no offense to the promising young catcher), trying to make up a 5-run deficit.  I mean, I'm a Cubs fan.  They have a chance to play in the World Series and it makes a huge difference to the club and fans alike whether more games are played at Wrigley Field.  But that point is moot because the All-Star game is supposed to be an exhibition.  What would be the point of naming Estrada as an All-Star if he didn't get a chance to play.  It's all just stupid.  It's an idea that never should have been let out of the think tank.  Baseball should take a page from the NBA and NFL.  The team with the best regular season record gets home field advantage...it's pretty simple, really. ",3926372.200407310.male.26.txt

Because I am a failure, I can't do anything else but fail at my job. I used to write in a cave type place - a place where my writings would be secure and it's going away.

I have run out of visits covered by insurance I could pay for more but there is no need for visits - I've almost stopped talking. I feel like going home, crawling up on my bed with the teddy bear my husband hates and crying.

One was my best friend of 8 years, we dated for a year and broke up but remained friends until about six months ago. He started to ignore me out of no where. Tried my best to talk to him but... he was the cause of why my depression spiraled back so bad that I almost took my own life.

Guy number two said he wouldn’t do what guy number one did to me... and now I feel like he is doing the same exact thing that guy number one did to me... we haven’t talked in two weeks. I know two weeks isn’t that long to not talk, but... seeing as guy number one didn’t talk to me for two weeks...

I've been searching for a job for 4 months to no avail (I used to have an office job for 4 years before quitting it to take a leap of faith to migrate to another country), and from the second month onward, I've plunged deeper and deeper into depression. Back then in uni days, I was diagnosed with clinical depression and was put on medications. I've been off them since my graduation, because I didn't want to depend on them for the rest of my life and I didn't really have the funds to continue the treatment back then. These days I feel exactly like I am slogging through those low energy periods again. My mind would never shut down at my usual bedtime and at times anxiety would keep me awake until 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning. My biological clock is a total mess, in the morning I would just sleep in and refuse to wake up, even though it's already past noon. I tend to shy away from as much social interaction as possible; I just plainly don't want to meet anyone, it freaks me out and makes me uncomfortable. I even refuse to answer any emails or continue the dreary job searching and job application. I know that I am in a big mess. I disgust myself for my lack of energy and determination to do anything. But then when I'm faced with the colossal task at hand, I'd chicken out, then I'd sleep on it, hoping that everything would somehow sort themselves out, only to find myself wake up in the next morning groggy and lethargic.

Recently I’ve picked up on several indicators that lead me to believe the end is near. I don’t really know what the best thing to do is, but I know one thing and that’s that I don’t want to miss any moments, let him down in his last days or regret anything for the rest of my life. He has lived a long and extraordinary life and has so many stories and so much wisdom. One thing is that I want to be able to tell my future kids about him and carry on that legacy after he passes and there are many stories that I can’t myself recite and many that I am sure that I haven’t even heard. I guess what I’m looking for is maybe someone who has gone through this sort of thing and can share maybe some things that they did or wish they would’ve done before their loved one passed away.

He met with this chick like 5 months ago and i was pleased for the dude, he seemed happy. 5 months on he still seems so attached to his girl, he rarey texts me and we used to play xbox together but none of those happen anymore. On the rare occasion when we do go to hang out he is always on his phone texting his girl, infact even in the cinema we watched a movie he was literally texting her during the film... even on xbox i hear the phone go off every minute or so We done so much shit together.... i gave him a driving instructor with a family discount cos i knew the guy and he got his license now, i helped him raise $600 for a new pc, and even went into a lil business together where i invested and he knew the contacts. This dude was my brother basiclly and now he never has time for me, we were so damn close and i wish things could go back to how they were without this girl because she is so paranoid of him talking to another girl I dont get why he has done this to me, ive always been there for him and now he doesnt even respond to my messages, i see him active on facebook but doesnt even read messages... i helped this dude out so much in high school he was going to fail, i taught him some shit and thats how we got close and he passed literally because of me. I dont know what to do... i feel like we are becoming so dinstant and only communicate once a week or so, im feeling so depressed and mentally hurt.... TL;DR; : What shall i do? Shall i talk to him or just wait it out ",Xboxdude52.txt
0,"School failure I think I'm doing something wrong. I found myself in a situation where I was lucky to move to prosperous country. Except I'm 27 with no degree, no proper work experience, just some odd jobs. I'm an embarrassment compared to other immigrants. Last year I began studying for the first time since high school , just to realize the field does not interest me. I barely even understand the language. My GPA is horrible. And I can't change schools for at least another 2 years due to family. I can't even get a job because my town has almost none, and the ones it does have are given to the natives (I'm foreign). The welfare covers my expenses for now but this is not a life I want to live.  I'm also anti-social and seem to fit the symptoms of ADHD, but my therapist claims it's just anxiety disorder and doesn't wanna prescribe any meds yet.  I do have a serious learning struggle even when language is not an issue, I can't seem to grasp the concepts unless teachers spell it out for me. Basically I'm unable to learn anything the moment it goes past the basics and it's rather depressing. ",ToxicHuman91.txt

I am so sick of being this unsatisfied brat I just got a new job doing what i went to school for, and I hate it.  I feel like such a fake .. so pointless. i feel like no matter what i do it doesn't matter I am always going to be unhappy like the grass is always going to be greener where I am not.  I've taken personality tests and they say this is my personality. i don't want this personality. i want to be happy like other people.  well i say other people, but to be honest i don't know anyone that i would consider happy. everyone just seems to go on with life just kind of doing what they're supposed to i think happiness is a lie.  the only people i know that seem to be okay are alcoholics and druggies.  so you know they're not really ok. lately i've just been trying to fill the huge empty hole that my life is.  it's such a load of crap.  my husband says he loves life but he can't go one day without smoking stuff or drinking a 6 pack and i just want to scream at him LIAR.  and he tells to appreciate it because one day its going to end.  and you know what , i know he's right, but i find myself thinking that that would be such a weight off my shoulders no pain no worries no hassles no nothing. just over.  just done with all this stupid bullshit and the lies. somewhere i learned that life is supposed to be easy once you reach a certain point or succeed at certain things.  but that is so wrong!!!!!!!!!!!!! life will never be easy i will always be dealing with this crap and that makes me so sad and so wishing i were dead.

0,"So I finally realized something this week... Been stuck in an episode since my birthday (just turned 25, as per my last post). Can't remember the last time I ate a proper meal. Sleep cycle is fucked. Haven't left the house in a week. Funny enough, I had planned on hanging out and doing some reading in a cafe today... only to never leave the house. All this time, I've been thinking how much I yearn to have someone, anyone, physically check in. Or a partner to cuddle with, hug, and hold me tight.... but all that just fades into the empty void. I used to be Christian, and used to pray. Now that I'm not, I'm realizing how truly alone I am in dealing with all this. My friends all live in the city center. They have jobs and livelihoods. Ultimately, I have to physically do things by myself. No one's gonna save me. It's heartbreaking. Physically, I'm just so alone. ",sourpatchkidj.txt
1,"Not good enough. Greetings, everyone. I am currently in need of venting my thoughts. Reddit seems like the perfect environment for fucked up people, like myself. I've come for the wisdom and maybe even the charming assholes. So, here's the scoop: Growing up, I was always compared to a specific relative. I won't say which, because I'm a paranoid fucker. But we shared the same gender, were of similar ages, and were always very different from each other. Still, we were extremely close. The biggest difference was our weight. Yes, I was always the ""larger"" one. People enjoyed to point it out, but what really stung was that our own family would as well. Fast forward to years later, when we were in our teenage years. It became so much more than our weight. Our family started comparing our physical appearances. They were always the more ""attractive"" one. The more ""successful"" one. We are both adults now. Our grandmother speaks wonders of this person, and only has negative things to say about me. Despite all of this, I was always deemed the ""nicer"" one. That hasn't mattered a single bit. I constantly beat myself for picking up the phone when our grandmother calls, because I give her personal details of my life only for her to turn around and use it as juicy gossip material. She is very sick, and I assume quite close to death. I pick up because I feel massive guilt when I ignore her calls, while my ever-so-""better"" relative ignores them with no problem, and is still worshipped. I've considered cutting ties with my entire family. I don't believe they genuinely care about me. Yeah, I'm struggling. Bad. I'm basically at rock bottom right now. Still, I highly doubt my wellbeing is in their best interest at all. I don't think I'll ever be the picture perfect grandchild, child, sibling, whatever. It drowns me deep in self-loathing every day.

1,"Well... I am unsure how to start this new blogging stuff...guess I will just reflect a little and see how it goes.  Have you ever been stuck in a matrix? I have! To me it was like being in a padded, suspended time warp during the early part of  my adult life. A time that lasted over 12 years. That shouldn’t happen to anyone...and shouldn’t have happen to me. But it did. I was 23 , a new single mom...no friends...no job...and not much family to speak of. I had to make money and take care of my son... I couldn’t afford to live on my own so me and my child stayed with my parents... I went back to school and learned a vocation. Then... tried for years and years to make a difference...be somebody and amount to something for my sons sake...the matrix I was in got thicker and harder to escape from...I couldn’t do enough for anyone. My parents, my employer, so called friends, relatives.... it was like total non-acceptance...I felt laughed at and demeaned.  (Like a RedHeaded Step Child.)  I had a vision of the way I wanted my life and it wasn’t happening. Feeling like every move I made no matter how positive only enabled those around me to throw dirt on my emotions and aspirations and even me. They would throw dirt on me! Spreading slanderous rumor making ugly innuendo... I would try and try to ignore and endure.  Oh!Gaud; How did I get there?  So much time had gone by in this continuum...my ideas were lost. Buried in the gook and gum of this matrix intra-cellular structure...  I got really  mad  one day and more or less threw my hands up in despare...then... feeling terribly,terribly  angry ... I suddenly broke free from the matrix by desiding right then and there ...That I was going to make a move. A move that would  change  my life and those that went with me for the better.  The  anger  did it...I was fed up...I had gotten to the point where I hated everyone around me...I had to get out or die trying...  It took alot out of me.

She doesn't want to see me and when I write to her she answers back just so that I can't say she's ignoring me and she continuously provokes me to get into an argument. I really had trusted her, and she had done the same, until a couple of months ago (she's always told me I was the only person who she actually trusted, even after we split up) so I feel like I've been used and then thrown away like an object. I then realized I'm not good at all at socializing, that she was the only truly important person in my life (except for other two friends of mine, who have their own lives and whom I don't want to annoy too much with my problems) and that I will probably never know anyone else in my life.

0,"I made a word cloud of all my depressive posts over the past three years. https://i.imgur.com/hNbtyW4.png This is based on all the posts on my throwaway account (this is my main account and has too many unrelated posts to sort through) since 2014. I think it's noteworthy that some of the biggest words in the cloud are negative. While going back over these posts from so relatively long ago, I noticed that most of the older ones seemed like they were written by a total stranger. If it were somebody else saying those things about me, it would be called harassment, but it was me saying those things about myself.  All in all, this has really made me realize that all the things I have written about myself are way off-base, and are only true in my mind during a depressive episode. I know something's wrong, but I don't know what to do about it. In some ways I'm sure I'll always think this way about myself, regardless of what I do, but I wish there were an easy way to manage it.

In order to combat my depression I write. To date I have written four major writings (50,000- 200  pages -  words or more) and am on my fifth. Last year, when I was on my first major writing one of my friends asked me if she could read it. I was hesitant because it's my soul. I take everything I feel and put it down on the page. It's all I do. i don't go out or have any kind of social life. Writing is my life. But, I eventually let her read it. She liked it and read that whole writing. Since then she has become my editor of sorts. There's just one problem - she's not editing. You see, she's a drama geek - in plays and everything - and doesn't have a whole lot of free time so I understand a slow pace, but lately I've had to prod her to do anything. Even over Christmas break she didn't do anything. Now, I have to call her on the weekends (which is the only time she'll even do it now) to get her to do anything. If I don't she'll forget she even has it. Every time I ask her about it, she just tells me how busy she is and I end up feeling guilty. I feel like she's rejecting me as a person, like she's saying ""i just don't care about you."" It hurts me so bad. It makes me feel like the one thing keeping me alive is stupid. It makes me want to kill myself. I feel like it's a burden to her. It hurts me so bad. It makes me go home and cut myself. I have no idea how to handle the situation. I want her to do it, but I don't want it to seem like i'm pestering her. I understand she's busy, but she makes time to go out with her other friends. Couldn't she make a little time for me?

0,"I joined yesterday and have been reading through some of the posts. Thought I had better introduce my self. I live in the UK. Looking back on my life I think I have always had depression. It got worse though, 3.5 years ago after the birth of my son. I though i had PND at the time. I was always crying, felt really low and would panic if I was left alone with the baby. It put a huge strain on my marriage and lots of arguments because my husband though I had gone off him. I went back to work put couldn't cope, lack of motivation etc. but like someone said below I put on a 'happy face' to make people think that I was OK. I muddled through for a year then went to see a GP who put me on Prozac. Stupid me came off it after 2 months thinking I was OK. Slowly the depression came back, I wasn't coping with my job, the simplest tasks at work and at home were impossible to face, I couldn't concentrate or make decisions. Last Spring it all got too much. I was getting up crying every morning, I became agoraphobic. I phoned in work and said i couldn't go in. I saw the GP and went on Prozac. I took 2 months off work. I stayed on Prozac until last September. And then, guess what, it all came back with a vengeance a few months ago. This time I was also feeling suicidal which really scared me. So I am now back on the Prozac and determined to stay on it. I think I have generalized depression made worse by circumstances. The birth of my son, trying to keep a job down and be a Mom, and my husband. Last year my husband really turned to alcohol and ended up ill in hospital. He has been on incapacity benefit ever since, so our relationship and our finances have really suffered. He has changed to. Even though he says he loves me he gets angry a lot, shouts at me, criticizes me, puts me down. I don't know how much more of it I can take, without leaving him. I make excuses for him, that it is his illness and lack of earning power that make him like that but it is no excuse to turn me into a nervous wreck who is scared to say anything in case he shoots me down. The Prozac has reduced but not removed my depression and I still have the odd day where I want to run away. I keep thinking 'will it go away if I leave my husband?' I no longer love him but life has dealt a difficult blow to us both recently and maybe one day when the stresses have been removed I will love him again. Anyway that's my story (sounds similar to Vanyas who i have PM'd). ",azmum_e_2_b_c4_uk.txt

Too late I just backspaced two whole sentences! There is this big fucking hard block of concrete in my head that stops me from doing anything including things I like such as drawing and reading. I love going on tumblr and pinterest and deviantart to look at the amazing drawings and paintings people are able to create.

1,"Well I think I know what my problem is. I'm not opinionated enough to own a blog. I'm totally indifferent about almost everything, so I can never think of anything to write.  Maybe I'll just write about what I did last night. Ben and I went to the park with his aunt, uncle, and cousins to watch a Tongan brass band play. We ate chicken from Sugarhouse Barbecue and it was so yummy. I don't know what their secret is, but their chicken tastes just like camping. Then the plan was to go back to the cousins' house to have brownies and ice cream and play Halo, so I asked to be dropped off at home because I didn't want to stay up all night. Plus I don't enjoy video games very often. Well they opted out of playing Halo because they wanted me to come have ice cream with them, so I went, even though I hate it when people change their plans for me. It makes me feel whimpy. So anyway, you might think that means we got home at a reasonable hour, but we still ended up staying there until midnight.

1,"Am I in a bad friendship? I have this friend and he's actually really fun and quite an extrovert. He's cheerful most of the time. But the thing is he has anger issues and he gets pissed off at people and stuff easily including me. Whenever i play games like league of legends with him he gets so mad at me for stuff that i didn't even do and even at one point filed a complaint and wrote stuff that was completely false about me. And I used to ask him questions sometimes via text and he'd always respond but then he'd say ""you could've at least said hi"". So one time i just said a simple hi to him and you know what? he said ""I'm really not in the mood for a pointless hi"" and he seemed really moody to me especially for some reason and then he typed something ""you know i really dont know why you bother..."" i couldnt read the rest because he deleted it. But whats weird is he still wants to play league with me and stuff which i find stupid because i know hes just gonna get angry at me again and only me. he never gets angry at anyone else he plays with in that game and it makes me feel sick. So i just stopped messaging him in general. and one time he said ""you know i dont know why im so aggressive to you so lets just forget that happened"" and i didnt say much and he said ""i know you dont have much to say and i dont care so lets just forget"". He didnt even say sorry for being so mean to me. To me it just looked like someone that was trying to clean up the pile of junk he left so he doesnt need to think of it later. It makes me feel so sick to think of. And sometimes he calls me a bitch and a hoe. Like really? Why would you call your friend that? I never called him anything like that. One time he was trying to talk to me and a bunch of other people were talking over him so I couldn't hear him. Then he said ""yo bitch"". I really wanted to punch him in the face that was really hurtful like I have a name cant you at least say my dam name?

Why does this pain happen to people This is my first time and please i need some answers on what to do, why does life work this way, i fucking hate that things had to go wrong this fucking way. My depression is taking over me and my family is worried about me. For the first time in high school i liked this girl for about 7 months and during that time we became best friends and i always thought she would like me if i cared for her and treated her right. i always acted the same way as her and found out we thought the same sometimes. We always talked to each other including late night till 2 or 3 am and we knew everything about each other and we always were with each other but instead she liked some asshole who didn't like me and always kept lying about me to her. She never believed what he said about me but chose to love him and be with him more and they always were with each other after class and it made me jealous and angry on why she would do this. One day i invited her to some place with her and my friends but she decided to also want to take the asshole and i got frustrated and ended our friendship. she got angry at me and decided to leave too. but one day the asshole decided to leave her because of a fight they had and she starts crying to me on the phone and i try to help her get over him but it hurts me when she says she loves this person who kept lying to her about me and other things and he was known to be a bad person and she only dated one guy before but he was super nice and i didn't understand why she liked him and she said she didn't either, it was only that she felt happy around him. She is such a pretty girl and most of the guys in the school agree and thought me and her were dating but they never knew she really liked this asshole and during the time they hanged out she kept asking me if they were right for each other and she said she would separate from him but she didn't listen to me. Instead they got closer and me and this asshole got into more fights with each other but she would rather not say anything and still be with him.

1,"Sometimes I have a crazy notion that runs through my head.  It's actually more like a recurring question that puzzles me at odd times and places but usually when I see some otherwise taken for granted ingenious invention.  For example, it happened this past Sunday as I sat in an Emergency Room waiting area (a friend had been bitten by a dog...) as I watched the automatic sliding glass doors.  What a wonderful and convenient invention.  A sensor detects your presence and opens the door.  Then it hit me...What would Benjamin Franklin think of that?   I think of Ben and what he would think quite often when I hear the telephone ring, see airplanes in the sky or cars on the road.  Just the idea of electricity (that covers lights, the radio, television, motion pictures...The list is endless), the concept of the internal combustion engine, the physics of flight...  Just think of how much fun it would be to tool around with Ben showing him all the things we've manage to create.  Can you imagine explaining how man has walked on the moon?  How would he react to hearing that we have a satellite circling, capturing data, recording it and reporting back to Earth from the planet Saturn?  We have come so far and have so much.  Ben would be very impressed with everything...   That's usually when another of my recurring thoughts hits me.  He'd be impressed with all the gadgets and inventions but eventually he'd see what kind of society we've become.  He'd be appalled by our lack of education in light of all the technological marvels.  Sure, it took a smart person somewhere to figure out the concepts of the new technology...But look what we've given up in return.  For all our efforts we have people that can't read and write...People that don't have or use their imaginations...People that can't think for themselves...People that are happiest doing no more than mindlessly doing nothing.

I saw a post on here about someone remembering a feeling of emptiness since they were five and just not knowing it was depression.  For me it's the opposite.  I was always a super joyful kid, and maybe a little too hyper.  (I was that annoying kid when I was 10-11).  Then around seventh grade I started to withdrawal from the world slightly, and just talked a little less than average.  This seemed all fine at the time, it made me a more likable person.  But I think that was the beginning.  I finally realized my lack of a friend group because of how I acted when I was younger during third quarter that year.  It wasn't bad depression, but it only got worse from there.  My Dad turned from mean to abusive starting next year, and my mom started to be disappointed with everything I do.

If only I could go back and warn myself. Like many of you, I have been suffering depression since I was very young. In fact, I can remember being in first grade, coming home and going to bed for the rest of the night. Of course, back then it felt more like fear. In 7th grade, I asked my mother if I was a manic depressive because I had read about it and I felt I had all the symptoms. She scoffed and said it was just normal teen hormones that made me feel that way. I love my mother and she has always been there for me. I used to call her at 2 in the morning crying and she would talk to me until I felt better. However, when I call her up today, she still doesn't understand when I tell her I am depressed. She thinks I need to get up and start doing things until I snap out of it. I try to tell her I have bills screaming at me and I still can't get out of the house to find work. I think she is in denial. Now, with all of the information I find on this site, I think I may even be bipolar. When I found the man I wanted to marry, I warned him that I had experienced many deep depressions in my lifetime and that it was probably likely to happen again someday. He said he would stay by my side no matter what, and he has. Unfortunately, it is painfully apparent that he has no idea at all how to handle it. When he tries to talk to me and cheer me up, I say mean things to him until we are both raising our voices. Let me tell you, when I'm like this, I don't back down either. I usually say something hurtful and then grind my teeth in anger for a while. He gets mad too, but it is also painfully apparent that he forgives me. Then, I feel like a real jerk. I just started seeing a psychologist, since I haven't had a job since last August and it's clear that I don't know my way out of this. I have only met with her once, but I think I will like her. She has told me to do a few simple things everyday until our next meeting on Wednesday. She wants me to get 1/2 hour of sunlight everyday, 15 minutes of exercise, and try to make a simple daily schedule to follow. I'm a bit worried because I haven't been able to do them because I just don't sleep right anymore. It is 8am and I haven't slept yet.

It’s a common trend that people live for other people but what do you do when you have no one to live for? I never had anyone to live for. It’s not a huge problem really, its another lingering question or jealousy I have whenever I meet a person. Every single one of them have someone who cares for them, even a stranger would care for them. It makes me feel jealous that no one would care for me or even bother to be nice to me unless I open my mouth and say I have cancer or they knew about any of my situation. People don’t care, they pity me. They realize, then, that I’m a hopeless situation and they can’t help me at all because they really can’t. No one can. Therapies don’t help. My therapist knows all of my situations are out of my control and he wants me to move forward with my life. It’s not really a bad idea, it’s the smart thing to do especially being someone in my situation. I just don’t know why I can’t. Every single being on the planet wants me to graduate already but my body doesn’t agree with me. It’s always either I’m too sad/ stressed/ depressed/ ashamed/ anxious/ lazy to go to school.

Why aren’t suicide booths similar to futurama a thing? I give up. I just want to die. P.S.

Here is my story: I just came back from a casino joined by my family members only, we were having a great time together and everybody were well entertained. Things were smoothly going until I committed a foul as a result of my lack of understanding about a certain kind of  gambling. Therefore, some of the participants of mine lost a small amount of their bet cash (likely because of my foul) and they said it was my fault. I was embarrassed because of my ignorance and I would have apologized each of them but I couldn't do it, I still feel I am guilty now. Now I cannot even look at my uncle face now ",YsAtNaF996.txt

Oh, did I pique your interest?  Well if I did, here's what happened. Yesterday, I called in and told them I would be picking up my two weeks notice, this got miscommunicated as ""Hey, I'm quitting right now"" and as I went in today, I was asked ""Didn't you quit."" Anywho, to make a long story short, I ended up in a mixture of quitting/getting fired.   Im fine with it, I have to start school in a couple week anyway.

They're outlaws! :)  I am unemployed as of today and going back to school in a couple of weeks. I've never been especially good in school, but not because I'm dumb. It's because I've never decided to go through the effort of doing anything in class, or at home for that matter. I guess that is pretty dumb. For what it's worth though, I ace all my exams.  The girl, y'know, the one I was telling you about before? The on with the gerbils, well, she is my love, and my everything. You'll definantly hear reference to her later in my blogging adventure.

0,"It feels as if I'm heading towards a dark place Hey, haven't been here before but I had a quick scroll and this feels like the right sub to vent to. I'm 18 from the UK, I've had a rough educational life (I alway talked, went in high with my friends, got in minor trouble that kinda thing). I fucked up college in the second year of my 2 year diploma course and got excluded for the same kind of shit previously mentioned but on a larger scale, this really fucked me up as I thought I'd end up doing nothing with my life when I really wanted to do something with it. 10 weeks ago I got a job and a paid for graduates course which pays out over £1100 per month after tax which is incredible for me, it's a job I love, work hard at and it's exactly the path I want to take in life career-wise. So I've been given a second start, I have money, great friends, a good social life and my life is on track but I still can't quite feel complete. I'm very social anxious and this affects my everyday life but I push through it, I have to. I smoke week almost everyday and I've been smoking for about 5 years now. The problem is, I still have a void that I can't fill and I can never really feel that happy by myself. I love my metal and I'm a huge music fan, I used to play a lot of games but I've stopped caring so much now. Sometimes I find it hard to enjoy things as much as I used to.

0,"Alright, this is a bit weird to explain, but I am having a lot of trouble making this decision so I am going to try and write it down. If anyone has any suggestions or advice to offer I would appreciate it. A while back my brother and I let a stray cat in and fed it, and we got really attached to it. It is probably the most needy animal I have ever met and will sit with people all day, loves it when you pet it, and I really like the cat. I wasn't thinking at the time, but later I realized I needed to pay a pet deposit like the rest of the people in my complex, so I could keep the cat. So my mother called up our landlord's office and they said that we could not have the cat. It seems really unfair to me that everyone else is allowed animals, but for some reason we are not. I don't think there is anything I can do about this and it makes me really sad. We didn't want to get rid of the cat so bad that we decided to hide the cat away, letting it inside only at night, and living in my brother's van in the day while we were looking to see if there was somewhere else we could move to. The problem is, I think I would only barely have enough money to move and I think it would be too risky that my family would lose our assistance if we were to go through with such a thing. Not to mention that I keep my spare money around in the case of emergencies and if something bad were to happen, I wouldn't be able to deal with it financially. So the only option I know of that is left is the animal shelter and I really do not want my cat to be locked up and possibly die alone in a cage. I know that it is getting old and that people take younger cats from animal shelters much more often than older ones. I want my cat to have a good place to live and don't want it to spend its final years in a cage, without loving owners. I am having so much trouble making this decision... I love my cat a lot and want it to be taken care of well and to be happy, but I am endangering my family the longer I try to hide it. My mother and brother keep telling me that it is my decision to make and I just keep procrastinating. So I posted this here because it is making me depressed and stressed out. Are there any options I am leaving out? Do I either have to spend all of my money to move or give it to an animal shelter? They both seem like such terrible options ",chaku_e_2_a_1_xx.txt

1,"Susceptible Younger Sibling I have a sexually active younger sibling who severely lacks proper sex education. She will not confide in me, our parents or any family for that matter (she’s afraid that my extended family and myself will snitch to our highly-religious parents, who are against premarital sex), but casually revealed her ""activities” to our hairdresser who felt uneasy by what she had heard. With that said, the hairdresser informed me of what was said, fearing that my sister may be in danger of herself. Situation: My sister's partaking in sexual relations with her boyfriends (yes, boyfriends since they change every few weeks) WITHOUT protection. She has very low self-esteem, and goes for guys with “nothing going for them” (i.e. no job, no education, drug-dealing/taking, etc.). But what triggered my hairdresser (whose primary concern is SAFE sex) to contact me was the fact that her current boyfriend is uncircumcised, does not use protection and has convinced my sister that “pulling out” is safe sex—revealing their lack of adequate sex education. Furthermore, my sister has complained (to me/our parents) of yeast infections and UTI’s, checking in-and-out of the clinic on several occasions, but casually dismisses it as wearing too-tight skinny jeans. And while my mother is comfortably in-denial and takes everything my sister says for face value, my father and I have had our suspicions about what may really be going on for awhile now. Some background information: - Sister comes from an upper income family - Youngest of 3, very spoiled - Fast-tailed, boy-obsessed, hates being single - (Barely) of legal age (technically “grown”, but not independent, so she lives with our parents who expects her to live by their rules until she moves out). - Was brought up Christian - Strong preference for men from poverty-stricken/rougher backgrounds and engage in illegal activities (I suspect she thinks it’s edgy?) - Has a job, but devotes every last penny either uber-ing/lyft-ing to be with her (job-less) boyfriends or loaning them money - Loving immediate/extended family - Very manipulative, yet extremely impressionable when it comes to guys - Current boyfriend is from overseas, deals/does cocaine (and pressures her to join in), jobless, without education, ill-tempered, manipulative and violent. Also his parents are entirely against their relationship due to her being of a different race/ethnicity than him. - Previous boyfriend was also ill-tempered, manipulative and violent, but also physically/verbally abusive, dealt weed, had no job/HS drop-out and made a “runaway” attempt with my sister which was prevented after I “snitched” to my parents (hence the reason she no longer confides in me, but I felt it was necessary given the severity of the situation). Cops were even involved. My parents have attempted to send her to a prestigious out-of-state college to get her mind off of guys and focus on her studies, however she shows very little interest in education, let alone bettering herself in any form or fashion. She “lives in the now” and has a very blinkered outlook on life. With everything said, I would like advice on how to handle the situation (i.e. what to do with the information). Should I relay it to our parents and risk “rattling” on my hairdresser (i.e. the source/proof in which my parents will ask for)? Should I mind my business and risk my sister catching something more severe/getting pregnant/etc.? Not to mention her current boyfriend's gang/violent/drug-related background could potentially put our family at risk (she's revealed our location/faces via social media and casual talk--entirely against our wishes) should they ever break up or anything of the sort (we had to place a restraining order on her last violent boyfriend). I have a very strong conscience and do not believe that I could live with myself should the latter happen. Sorry for the novel, but I wanted to expound as much as possible to give an accurate reporting of the situation at hand. I have always been over-protective over family (my little sister especially), and it breaks my heart to see her follow such a destructive path. Any suggestions would be very much appreciated.

0,"I want to share a personal project I'm proud of A month ago I was feeling completely unmotivated to do anything. I was feeling that none of my connections with friends are as deep as they used to be, that I'm not as close to my family as I used to be, that nothing I do at work really matters, and that my health is slowly deteriorating. I just wanted to quit at everything. Then I was hanging out with a friend I hadn't seen in a while, and he admitted to me that he had been struggling with depression, so we both opened up about it. He ended up recommending the book ""Feeling Good"" to me, since it had helped him improve a lot. I read it and was initially a bit disappointed... some parts were underwhelming, some felt annoying/condescending, and the solution to every problem seemed to be the ""three-column technique."" But after trying a few of the exercises in the book, I admit it turned out to be somewhat helpful. One of the exercises/quizzes in the book is the ""Depression Checklist,"" which (as I'm sure many of you are aware of) assesses your level of depression on a scale from 1 to 100. At the time, I was scoring in the ""Moderate"" range. After a couple weeks of applying some of the exercises, I was down to the ""Mild"" range. So I decided to create a project that might help me learn a bit more about myself, with regard to the effect of my daily habits on my level of depression. What I wanted to build was a simple web app that would let me score my productivity on a daily basis (based on exercising, reading, socializing, meditating, etc) and then plot that against my daily depression score. I wanted to see if there was a correlation between higher productivity and lower depression, or if certain activities had a greater impact on my mood. Ironically what I discovered was that working on the project itself was a huge mood-booster for me, since it gave me a sense of purpose and was a great outlet for creativity. As I've gotten further along in the work, I've noticed my depression level has slowly started rising again. But for a while, I was actually in the ""Normal"" range of depressive emotions! I couldn't believe it. Regardless, the project has also given me more insight into a few things that drastically help my mood. Even though my mood isn't at the level it was a couple weeks ago, it's nice to know that investing in personal projects gives me a lot of satisfaction :) (Also if anyone is interested in trying out the app, feel free to check it out [here](https://beok.herokuapp.com/). It's stupid simple and still a work in progress, but I'm still kinda proud of it... and if it were able to help even just one other person, that would make me pretty happy &lt;3) ",potaters_gon_potate.txt

If I take it then, it will be alongside the theory class I need for my Literature major, and that would make my brain implode (again). So maybe that was just decided for me. As things stand, this fall I'm taking World Novels (Lit), Western Civilization to 1500 (History), Beginning Latin, French 301, and a morning volleyball class for an even 12 credits. I probably could have handled the theory class this fall, or dropped either Western Civ or Latin and volleyball, but we'll see if it's still cancelled by mid-August. I also need to apply for graduation, but my advisor is out of town this summer, so we'll wait until the Fall semester has started.  It's freezing cold in this house.

0,"I don't feel well. Hey, I'm a highschool freshman and this has been the lowest I've ever been from the past three years of feeling like I should be gone. Buckle up your seatbelts because this'll probably be pretty long. Since the beginning of this year, I've been wanting to die; I feel so lonely and as if nobody actually cares about me. So, there's my primary friendship group; the people I hang out with the most. All of my (2) ""genuine"" female friends pretty much don't give two shits about me because I tend to act really clingy to them and other people because I've been friends with them since first grade and don't want to lose them. One of my female friends is kinda popular and she barely talks to me, and I just feel like I'm undeserving of her time or something; she's also kinda claimed my other female friend, so I don't get as much time to hang out with them as I used to. My guy friends are also a bit popular and they also happen to be dating my two female friends lol. They do make me feel happy talking to them, and I do hang out with them a lot, but sometimes I feel like I shouldn't be hanging out with them all that much because then I'm ""stealing"" them from my friends. I also get pretty bummed not being in a relationship when my other friends are, and I do feel like I'm not needed amongst any of my friends. (Basically, I just feel like the rebound when one of my friends aren't there). Can we actually talk about one of my female friends a bit more, actually? We'll call her M and my other female friend B. We met M last year and we invited her to hang out with us during our lunches. M was going through a tough time and we helped her out all the time and it was great making a new really close friend. She was really fun to talk to, but I don't know...sometimes she says some shit to me that makes me kinda bummed. I remember telling her how I felt kinda depressed once, and she said something along the lines of ""Stop asking for attention and actually do something"". Another time, I was hanging out with B's boyfriend, but the next day, M was mad at me and told me I shouldn't take him from B (which I do get and feel bad for, but B is totally cool with it and understands how me and her boyfriend hang out :p) Recently, (I don't remember what initiated the conversation really) M and I were talking (which rarely happens anymore), and she was talking about how she feels like she doesn't have anyone that actually cares for her, when she has so many people that clearly do care about her and love her. Then she proceeds to tell me to actually go and make friends again. I hate being petty and talking about other people, but I just don't feel comfortable being very close to her anymore and I'm not sure she's interested in talking to me either. So then that leaves like two male friends, and again because they're in relationships with B and M, I'm trying to pace myself with hanging out with them so one of them don't get upset. It's also pretty hard to make friends in a school where most people are white and really attractive, or already have their place. I'm a non-attractive Asian female that tends to make weird jokes and seem really masculine with the way that I mainly put forward, and I just don't fit in anywhere. I have a lot of anxiety of what people think of me, so then I sometimes struggle with talking to people. I wouldn't say people dislike me at all, it's just that nobody would hang out with me outside of school and it's hard to find people that are willing to spend time with me. There's also the problem with others' expectations of me;; Almost all my life, I've been deemed ""smart"", which has caused so much pressure and anxiety throughout the years. My parents really want me to do well in school, and peers think I'm so great at everything. I *thought* it would go away after elementary school, but even here, people consider me being so ""smart"" and able to do anything. With currently a ~95 average in my classes, it's extremely difficult to maintain that and I feel like if I do any worse, someone is going to get mad at me. People expect me and think I'm so good, but really I'm just average at literally everything I do. I also have no idea what I want to do with my life. I'm not very good at anything, and I have so many interests, it's hard to pin down something that I *should* do with my time. Nothing really interests me enough to do it for like 25~40 years of my life, and the things I would be interested in have literally no way of making a living off of or is something totally unachievable. I feel like I can't make any difference to anyone in the world, and I'll die not making an impression on anyone or having anyone really care about me in the end. I've been hurting myself since about third grade, mostly from scratching myself with my nails until it leaves a mark for a few days and hitting myself on the back of the head. It's extremely satisfying and I feel like it's a good thing to punish myself for being such a waste. So that's pretty much the gist of it, I guess? Mostly just problems with self worth and having others view me a certain way. There is some other stuff, but nothing that I can really think of at the top of my head. These past 3 months have been excruciating, and I haven't gone a day without thinking I should just end it all and give up. I want to be happy, but that just seems so far away and I don't know if me living benefits anyone. Admittedly, I don't want to die, but I *do* at the same time? I feel like I have no place in the world and I can't talk to anyone about how I'm feeling because none of them are actually willing to hear what I have to say, so now I'm just dumping my feelings on Reddit. I'm tired of living and feeling like shit. I don't remember the last time I genuinely felt happy to be alive. I want someone I'm close to tell me that they love me and care about me and say I'm not a useless piece of garbage and that what I say isn't meaningless or invalid. I don't want to feel alone. I don't ask to feel alone. I feel alone because I am alone, and I feel like I can't tell anyone this because I don't want them to walk out of my life. I'm sorry if this seemed really petty and like I'm just bitching about some shitty first world problems, because I know I am. :/ I just feel kinda down right now and I haven't been able to tell someone how I actually feel in months. So yeah. Thanks for reading, stranger. Sorry for the inconvenient text wall. ",young_saltmachine.txt
1,"Tipped off by someone that best friend is not okay It's been a semester in college and people here are very interesting. Recently, I [F] made a best friend Theo* [M] in class. We're both in the same major, speak the same native language, and he always helps me understand the homework (he's smarter than me), meaning that we spend about 2 hours/day together, if not more. We got super close within a few weeks, and I started to develop a crush on him. But I have a boyfriend (long-distance), and my feelings for Theo were not sexual, so I resolved to think of Theo as just an older brother - it hasn't been a problem for a few weeks now. We still hang out as best friends. My primary means of communication with him is facebook in our native language. A week before, he added me on snapchat, but we never talk on it. The other day, I got a snap with a mispelling of my name, to which I sent a question mark. The day after, I got a snap from a girl Lucy* claiming to be Theo's boyfriend, who told me she got my username from Theo. She told me that he was acting weird, and for my name w/mispelling, to look out for him since they were also long distance. I don't know how to approach the situation. I want to make sure that Theo is okay, since I did have some problems with suicidal/bored/lonely friends before. But he never told me that he has a girlfriend or about Lucy, and when I took to other forms of social media to find her, I couldn't find her - she wasn't in any tagged photos of Theo either. I may be completely over thinking, but I also think that Lucy has ascess to Theo's snap, which is how she got to me - meaning that I'm not sure if Theo knows that I know Lucy. If she has ascess to the snap, she could also have acess to his facebook (although I'm pretty sure she can't speak our native language).... Basically, I'm not sure how to approach him to ask if he's okay okay. I always ask how his day was, and it ranges from okay to sleepy. So if I ask if he's okay, he might ask me why I thought he wasn't okay, and I don't think I can say his girlfriend was wondering - we don't talk about relationship stuff, I don't think he know I have a boyfriend, although this is posted all over my social media.

She just got into her first serious relationship, had sex for the first time, got drunk for the first time and also had her first pregnancy scare (i was with her when she took the test).  We’re 17 by the way. However, whenever we talk it’s always about her life, and her boyfriend. She built up so much courage to dump him only to get back with him the next week. They’ve known each other for only a month and he said i love you within a week of them dating. He’s emotionally manipulative and so immature but she insists that she only tells me the bad things about him not the good things. I want to support her but she makes it so hard. She never asks about my life anymore. I’m going through a really tough time yet it’s never come up. All we talk about is her and her relationship. I know it’s a big part of her life but it feels like my life is just irrelevant to her. I’ve never drank alcohol or had sex or even been in a relationship so it feels like we’re just drifting apart. I don’t relate to her anymore. Obviously I love her loads but it feels like this friendship is one sided and purely based on her.

1,"help with friends/roommate situation I have been trying to be friends with my roommate for months, but recently noticed she uses me. I always invite her to hang out, I do all the cleaning, I bake her food, do sweet things, helped her when shes throwing up, taken care of her, and overall have been called an amazing roommate by others. She's never once said thank you or has reciprocated, and my mother and a friend called it into my attention. I was fine with it (sort of), but I really wish she would have maybe wanted to be friends. But like I said, its fine you can't force people to care back. My problem arose when I introduced her to my bestest friends because she was sad and lonely and heading down a road I was very familiar with and didn't want her to go through, and she proceeded to ""Steal"" my bestest friends. I only say the world steal because she doesn't try to be friends with me and talks behind my back with them and has thoroughly excluded me from my own friend group. I'm just so angry and can't talk to her, she has permanently damaged my friendships because she literally always hangs out with them now, and has just kind of shoved me to a curb. I find it extremely inconsiderate because this year has been really rough for me because I was lowkey depressed for medical reasons and a tough break up, and she knew I was lonely and super super happy when I made my supposed close friends. She is so fake with them, it doesn't make sense. For example, one of my friends was going through a rough time and I was helping him get through it, and my roommate tried to butt in and help him too after meeting him like once. Yes, reader you are probably thinking to yourself, what's wrong with wanting to help people? And I would agree with you, there isn't anything wrong. But the thing is that she lacks consistency. She only tries to help when it is beneficial to her. Helping people is not in her personality, I spent months and months sobbing and upset and she would just run away and turn a blind eye. Why care about my friend who I had taken the time to bond with and gained trust with? She literally had met him like twice?! I think I forgot to mention that we are both female and all my friends are male and she didn't have any male friends before this and she was upset and lonely because of an ex...sounds sketchy af to me.... Point is, I haven't talked to her in two weeks, I just can't hang with my friends anymore, and everyone thinks I'm the bad guy.

1,"Only friend who consistently wants to hang out with me--I've started liking him less and less! help? No names or genders here, and I'm not getting into specifics on events just in case... I have one friend who consistently wants to hang out, unlike my other friends, but the problem is that over the last few years I've started liking them less and less. They're fun to talk to and hang out with -usually- but their personality grates on me and there have been a few times when they have made me quite angry in ways that are difficult to reconcile. They can also end up being a downer though they have been working on it. An unknown quantity of my other friends also dislike them (I know a few for sure, but who knows how many they've pissed off in the meantime) so I either have to plan events without them (and they get upset) or not invite my other friends who dislike them. We've known each other for years, and they consider myself and a few others very close friends but I have gotten the distinct impression it's one-sided. But they haven't done anything wrong (to ME) that would really merit breaking up a friendship so I've kept begrudgingly hanging out with them and chatting with them even though I'd rather not and just forget they exist. At one point I was one of very, very few friends they had, but I know they have a good consistent friend group now so... I don't know! Advice, please? Is it ok to just not want to be friends anymore even if the other person hasn't done anything wrong? When I think about hanging out with them even though I know we'd probably do something fun I just feel apprehensive and mildly annoyed. ",SexySnakeLadyCastle.txt

Your so called 'friends' abandon You, because your depression talk has gotten too dark. But what's the worst part? That you can't control it? That you can't stop it? Maybe it's the fact that just maybe... just maybe you don't want It to stop. You cling onto your pain, because after all..it's familiar. It's been with you for a while. You stand upon the dark edge, upon the highest edge you could find. You feel the wind blow in your face. You freeze. All the good moments, All the good people. It all comes in floods of part nostalgy and part regret. What took you to this edge? What made you so desperate, To take such drastic action?

I was texting my mom today about several things (husband can get ribs on sale at work for them, MIL invited me and my mom to a play, things my MIL said that irritated me...etc. She was on break at work). At the end, she mentioned my dad is home sick today. Maybe I should call him. So I call him and ask him jokinging why he's sick. He said he has the flu or a cold or something. He stayed home yesterday too. Then he mumbled something offhand about how mom wasn't going to tell me because I never ask them how they are. Do normal parents do/say stuff like that? Won't tell their kid that one if them are sick because they don't ask how they are? It makes me feel terrible but also manipulated. It's not like my mom has never given me the silent treatment because she thinks I don't call enough. The thing is...I HATE small talk. I never ask anyone how they are. It feels fake and wrong to me(maybe because I don't think most people actually care about me). They(anyone) can tell me if they don't feel good. I wouldn't wait til asked to tell my close family/friends if I don't feel well. I also have social anxiety and anxiety in general. These kinds of comments make me want to call them even less.

1,"Best friend of 12 years seems to be drifting When we were in middle/high school we were inseparable. I thought she was the most amazing person to ever walk the planet. She made me feel so smart, beautiful, special, etc...I loved her so much. We went through everything together during those times and when college came around, we went to different schools. I had to work 2 jobs to keep my head above water and couldn't always make the 4-hour drive to see her as often as I wanted. She also got into drugs, which was no issue with me, but since I was never into it, I stopped getting invites to places with her (probably due to the fact I always was ALWAYS working.) We both drifted a bit in college, but then afterward we (and our SO's) moved to the same city. I was so excited to finally have a better schedule and see her as often as I could. I told her how I found God after struggling with depression and anxiety and she immediately accused me of being homophobic because I said I was Christian (born again I guess, we both grew up Catholic). Which was severely not the case. She also accused me of being so different that it's like she doesn't even know who I am anymore. I let her vent about the drifting and the differences we both grew into since middle/ high school, without even mentioning to her that she was different too, it's called growing and changing as you age, but I still loved her just the same...then I expressed how I don't want to lose her over this and we eventually squashed the beef. I know she doesn't like my boyfriend of 5 years all that much, mainly because she thinks he changed me, not taking into account that I can make my own decisions and have my own thoughts that that nothing to do with my boyfriend's. 2 years go by and during those two years, her father passes away unexpectedly. He was the light in her life and it was so painful to see everything she went through during that time. I was there for her as often as she needed me and then some. Eventually, things started to feel really one-sided. I kept ignoring it because I knew she was grieving, but after almost 2 years, it was starting to get to me. My calls and texts were hardly received, she always seemed to be in a rush to talk to me, it felt like walking on eggshells. I guess now, what really bothers me is that a friend of hers is going through a hard time with her SO and my best friend has been extremely supportive and just going above and beyond with this other girl, while all I feel like I've received from her is criticism of my relationship, my values, my political views (which she really knows almost nothing about but assumes my position). As I write this, I'm actually getting angry at how much I've been there for her, but how little she has been there for me. I'm extremely scared to bring all this up to her because she is so critical and everything she says cuts deep. It's not a good feeling, but neither is this. I don't really know what to do, and I can't imagine losing her. I would hope I can work up the confidence to tell her how I'm feeling and we can have a rational conversation about it.

I also liked how they had sex, and the girl's shirt was on inside out for the rest of the film. Oh, but I wish I had seen all of it. Obviously, something that starts off like that must have a grand finale. But my mum wrestled the remote off me with a stern ""No more tacky B-grade films about British punks!""  But they weren't punks, mum. They were ravers.  The whole experiance left me hungary for more B-grade films. The 'B' in 'B- grade' stands for 'Brilliant', right? Oh, good. Anyway- Blurred.   IT HAD EVERYTHING.  A deformed freak who picked up hitchikers, playing a recording of a woman having multiple orgasms, in his wagon of death?  Hillbillies eating lasange?  Threesomes in a limo? The driver wearing a cocktail dress?  A stripper-hating nerd who fails to find true love?  Some ugly bitch who picked up an even uglier bitch [male, this time] and attempts sex with him? Several times?  Gothic girls on acid?  One of those great endings where they freeze on the face of each character and the text at the bottom of the screen tells you what happened to them after ""schoolies""?  IT. HAD. EVERYTHING.

1,"Brother owes Mother money, lives with her and isn't paying rent. Advice please? Not really sure which sub is the best place for this, so I've cross-posted in r/family, r/legaladviceuk and r/advice. Please let me know if any of them are inappropriate or if there are better subs for this. Thanks! The back story to this is long and possibly convoluted, but the tl;dr is my brother has had financial troubles for many years. In 2012, after the death of our grandmother, our mother paid off a large sum of my brothers' debts. He then paid some of this back with his own inheritance from the same. As a result of various relationship and/or financial cock-ups he has then loaned various further sums from our mother but with almost no repayments. He then ends up in a position to either bail out back to our mothers or lose employment and go wherever it is you go when you have no home or job. To be frank, we (myself, my partner and my mother) are at a loss as to what to do next. We think that perhaps we only have one realistic option (to kick my brother out and cut our losses) but this is something we would rather avoid. So we're asking Reddit for advice. So to  (try yet fail to) cut a long story short... My brother moved back in with my mother in early December 2017 due to the breakup of a relationship. When he did so, he agreed (verbally) to both pay a very reasonable rate of rent and payments towards previous debts owed toward our mother (both monthly). He was given December as a 'payment holiday' of sorts. Two weeks later my brother took out a loan to replace his car as he needed transport to and from work. His previous vehicle was written off toward the end of his previous relationship and he did not replace it with the money gained from the resultant insurance claim. Due to poor credit history, our mother was guarantor for this loan. Due to concerns regarding my brothers previous unreliability with regards to money my mother decided to make a written and witnessed agreement with my brother regarding rent, the loan, and payment of previous debts. However, we are all collectively broke (not as broke as my brother) and so paid legal advice was out of the question. After some research I drafted a basic agreement, it was signed and witnessed by my mother, brother, partner and myself. In hindsight I should probably have used a solicitor for this but it is what it is. Fast-forward to 05/02/2018 and no payments have been received for anything. My mother received both an email and text alert for late payment on the loan that she is guarantor of on 31/01/18 but no other correspondence. She has not contacted the loan company but has received no further correspondence so believes my brother has paid this instalment at least. My mother also received a phone call from the garage that my brother bought he new car from, for which he loaned the entirety of the cost as the majority of the loan my mother is guarantor. He still owes them money. In short, besides kicking him out of my mothers house and saying goodbye to both my brothers previous debts (and therefore a large amount of my mothers money) and also resigning my mother to paying for the loan he took out in December, what can we do? Does the written agreement we made mean anything legally? What can I do to help my mother claim the money she lent previously? Or are these things lost causes? Any and all help is much appreciated. We just don't know what to do, but don't want to see my  brother completely on his arse (unless I've put him on it...). TL;DR My brother owes my mother a significant amount of money, lives with her, she is guarantor for one of his loans, he has not paid his agreed rent etc. and we know he owes others money. What do we do now? Can kick him out, don't want to, seems likely may have to soon. Cannot live with or afford this. Edit: We are in the UK ",mishtersmiley.txt

1,"Ah, what a tangled web we weave.  To say im involved in some sort of bizarre love triangle would be overdoing it.  But, in a sense, maybe thats what it is.  In order to sort this out, I should start from the beginning.  I was working in a rehab for brain injured adults when I met her.  She was a petite spunky girl recently arrived in the area from california.  Some how or another, she showed interest in me and begain inviting me places outside of work.  I didn't really care, I was a student supporting myself and dealing with roomate problems, housing problems, getting to class on time, getting to work on time...the whole in and out of survival.  But, while im not all that great at subtle hints, she was aggressive enough for me to pick up on the fact that she liked me.  And so, after a long night of drinking and a bit of passing out and *unkowningly* spooning her, our relationship began.  It was cool, did all the great things you during a new relationship: trips to the beach, visiting the family, staying up late talking, holding hands, doggie style sex...(heh).  At some point, irresponsible as we were there was an abortion.  I dont want to go into here how bad that affected me; for her, I can only imagine it was much worse experience; but, it was her request and I supported it.  I do know having to walk through a thong of anti-abortion assholes didnt make it easy at all.  Not to mention I wanted to choke the living hell out of a few of em.  Time passed and the relationship seemed good.  Then, one day, she told me she was moving back to california and wanted me to come after I graduated in a semester.  I wasnt too sure about this; but, I agreed.  She left.  Afterwards, I continued to go to school and doubt settled in.  Perhaps I should break up with her?

I've been looking around a lot online to find somewhere I can talk, but all the chat rooms and forums say they're about one thing and then you get inside and everything's about sex.  Then I stumbled into this place.  I started reading postings and everyone seems so concerned about everyone even though they have never met these people. I haven't struggled with depression my whole life or anything like that.  I am only 22 but feel so old.  I am very, very recently separated (let's face it broken up) with my ex-fiance.  We have dated for almost five years and have a son together who will be two on Saturday.  He hasn't treated me the best (never hit or anything physical like that just never around) and he's really not what I want my husband or even the father of my children to act like.  He does have moments of goodness and this is what makes it so hard because why can't he always act like that.  I know he's capable of it.  I told him we should separate but I know he's been thinking it for a long time.  He's been forcing things because of his family and because he feels ""respect"" and blah blah for me.  I stayed around because he's the father of my child and face it it's hard to find someone new when you're a woman and you already have a kid.  I love him very much and I guess I was just expecting him to wake up one day and say man I need to change or I'm going to lose this great girl.  I wanted to separate because I think that's the only way he's going to realize how good of a girl I am and how good I am for him.  Now I'm scared though that he'll never come to this realization or meet someone else.  He says he's not looking, but let's face it he's a man.  He says he needs at least 6 months to find himself.  It makes it hard on me because we have a son together and for this reason my ex is always coming around and actually now that we're not together we probably see him more. I have no family where I live and the last 5 years have been devoted to my ex and son.  I have managed to lose contact with any friends I had and never made any new ones.  I am now completely alone except for my son, which I feel like I can't take good care of because I'm always crying.  I'm a high school teacher and I had to take a couple days off this week because I'm so touchy and can cry if the wrong thought pops up in my head.    It's affecting every part of my life and it's so overwhelming.

0,"My boring sob story Family members told me all the time that being an adult is shit and I should make the most of being a kid. So when depression hit me I thought it was normal, but it didn’t feel “right.” I wasn’t upset all the time, it was just like a flat misery sort of feeling. Things started to feel odd for me, certain sounds and smells and silly things like the wind of my face felt wrong. Like they’d be toned down somehow. Eventually I became completely disconnected from my emotions, save for the occasional moment when I actually find something funny. I’ve been on two types of medication and had therapy too, neither of which did anything for me. I didn’t notice myself become so gradually withdrawn from everything. Now going to the shop or getting the bus is something I’d rather not do. Things I’d do every day. My social life went backwards as well as my social skills. Now I’m afraid to talk to people. I literally reject girls I’m interested in on the spot, before I even have chance to fuck it up myself. Things that I would do without thinking now take encouragement and energy. Then came the cynicism. Belief that nobody out there was pure and everything they did was for their own personal gain. Suppose it’s true in a sense but I wish I didn’t have this “paint everybody with the same brush” mindset. It’s hard to believe I’m the same person at times. It’s been 7 years now and I’ve had enough. Just dunno what to do. I feel like I’ve tried everything. Can’t help but feel I’m partly responsible, for buying into the shit I told myself. ",ShowMeYourM0ves.txt

1,"My mother and her tragically unlucky family Hey, guys, I thought this was worth posting because I'm still totally gobsmacked at how unlucky and dysfunctional my mother's side of the family was, and it interests me because it sounds like a curse, when it was likely all just chance. My mother was born in the late 50's, and it was my grandparents' third child, although she eventually had six siblings in the end (only two brothers are still alive). The way my auntie and uncles died, and how one turned out, creeps me out. So here we go; So my mother used to have younger twin siblings - one boy and one girl - and my mother when she was four got into a serious car accident (grandfather was driving) so this would be 1962. She and my grandfather survived but her twin siblings didn't survive and both were tragically killed at the age of two. But it gets unluckier. So, a few years go by, my mother has two new little brothers at the time (let's call them George, born in 1963, and Alan, born a couple of years later) 1975, and again a tragic loss. My grandparents and family go through the loss of George, who, if you do the simple math, was only twelve when he died in a boat accident during a school trip. Apparently he jumped in the water to impress his friends while kayaking, and a boat later came speeding, didn't see him, and the front of it struck George's head. He drowned while unconscious because the teacher wasn't present (and apparently, he got in alot of shit for that). But again, it gets unluckier. Four years later, 1979, my grandfather, who was one of the bosses of a distribution warehouse, got into an accident during work. Wasn't told how, but it was fatal. So during the late 70's leading up to my grandfather's death, my mother's two older brothers (let's name them Johnny and Frank, both in their twenties) end up doing drugs, although my uncle Frank apparently handled his habit better than Johnny. Uncle Johnny eventually moved onto injecting heroin, was stealing off family and friends until he got kicked out of my grandma's. He eventually disappeared from the family. So 1983, after a couple years from last hearing of Johnny, my mother and her family receive news that a body found overdosed in a park four months prior, belonged to Johnny. Died at twenty-seven and wasn't identified for months by forensics. He was homeless and had nothing in possession to identify who he was. So my grandma, who is now nearing ninety, is still going strong. Mentally and physically great besides just a walking stick. She lost four children at the ages of two, twelve, and twenty-seven. And a husband. I never met any of them because this, of course, all happened before I was born. The ones who are still here is Alan, Frank, and my mother. My uncle Alan turned out to be okay. Frank, on the other hand, now in his sixties, is an abusive alcoholic who lives in a crummy apartment with whoknows and has two kids he never sees. He turned down rehab many times but my grandma once told me that he drinks because he blames himself for what happened to Johnny, since he was the one who introduced him to drugs. But he hates us and wants nothing to do with the rest of his family anymore. I've only seen him four times in my life, and he was abusive on two occasions. One time when we went for a family meal when I was six, he ruined the night by abusing the resterant staff. So my mother and uncle Alan are the only people out of seven kids who turned out to have positive lives. Depressing as fuck, isn't it? ",Gherico70.txt

I took a leave from work in 2014 for mental illness, at which point I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder, prescribed Zoloft and was back at work when my short term disability ran out.  This was the first time I'd been on anti-depressants.  I felt tired all the time, had no sex drive, and started gaining weight, but at least I was functional. Over the next year, I received a few verbal warnings and 1 written warning at work about my poor performance.  Eventually, the mask broke and I was on leave again in 2015.  This time I was away for much longer, was diagnosed w/ dysthymia, tried several different medications, found out that just about every SSRI gave me horrible side effects (sweating, nausea, insomnia, no sex drive, I'm actually thinking now that maybe they caused serotonin syndrome) and eventually landed on Remeron and Wellbutrin.  This combo actually started to work, without any side effects (except for weight gain, which I've been managing with a diet now).  This time, I returned to work because I received notice in the mail that my employment was going to be terminated because it was coming up on 2 years without being at work.  I figured if I was going to be fired for not returning, I may as well return, make some money and worst thing that happens is I get fired anyways.  I was not better when I returned to work, I was functional, I was able to smile, but the low mood persisted in a big way. And so here I am, still working, trying to fake it everyday, feeling like a house of cards thats ready to topple.  I'm afraid because if I go off work again that will have been 3 leaves of absence, and I really don't think I could show my face around here anymore after that.  I remember how horrible my life felt when I was on medical leave.  I remember falling behind on child support, having to borrow money from my parents.  I remember trying to convince my girlfriend that my low sex drive was because of meds and not because of her.  I remember trying to convince an insurance company that I'm sick, while simultaneously trying to convince myself that I can get better.  I remember feeling like a useless waste of skin that drained on the resources of everyone that dared to care about me.  I guess what I'm saying is I know, right now, I'm suffering from depression, and I'm afraid of what might happen if I admit that again. ",imtav.txt

He is a gorgeous little boy, he likes to eat, play, pull the cats' ears, coo, laugh, and nap with his daddy. Gabe also has spina bifida and hydrocephelus (sp?). It was quite a shock to learn that he had spina bifida. We went in for our 20 week check-up and everything was very normal. We found out he was a little boy and that he was growing well. At 28 weeks, i developed diabetes, that sucked, so we asked the doctor to do another ultrasound to make sure gabe wasn't getting too big, that was when we found out that his spine hadn't closed all of the way and that the ventricles in his brain were a little bit larger than they should be. Talk about overwhelmed, disoriented, and generally confused, we had no clue what the hell spina bifida was, let alone how we were going to deal with it! At 37 weeks, Gabriel was delivered by a wonderful team of doctors and rushed to the NICU to be prepped for surgery. For almost 2 weeks we couldn't hold him, nor could I breast feed, snuggle, or be very close to him. I think that the worst part was going home without him. He stayed in the hospital for 16 days. He had a shunt placed in his head when he was 14 days old. My husband was freaking out over the shunt, after all, they had to put it in his brain! Everything worked out fine, and he came home with us and we have been living pretty happily ever after. Ok, not quite, reality has a funny way of making the whole, ""oh look we have a cute little baby in the house, isn't this fun??"" be a little more like, ""holy shit, i never sleep, i've worn the same clothes for 3 days, and i smell!!!"" on top of this, we are dealing with a child who has to see special doctors, an hour away, i might add, and we are continually worrying about something going wrong.  The special doctors are still a reality, but we don't see them very often now, only about once every 3 weeks. Now at 6 months, gabe is a pretty normal baby. i am back to work at the Montessori school I teach at, and gabe comes with me. He loves all of my kids and they love him back. We are blessed that Gabe has a ""low level"" case of spina bifida, which means, he has bladder and bowel control, he will walk, and most people won't even realize has a birth defect!

0,"Advice on where to post for advice on taking antidepressants. Hi, UK based poster - I've recently taken my Doctors advice and got a prescription for antidepressants. I've been in-and-out of various states of mild to severe depression throughout my teens &amp; twenties, but I've always figured this is just something everyone has to deal with at some stage or another, so I've never sought help even when falling off a proverbial cliff edge. After much deliberation, someone I care deeply about got me to try counselling, but I find that I'm really not getting much out of it right now, as I don't have the will to try, and my focus is all over the place (I'm being tested for ADHD too, but I'm still awaiting the results). My Doctor suggested trying a combination of antidepressants and CBT (the latter of which I am currently attempting to source a support group for), however I have an underlying phobia of long-term medication after seeing several people close to me, use it as a crutch and just become something wholly unfamiliar to me as a result. I've been prescribed Citalopram (Celexa for those stateside) but like I said - I have deep-seated reservations about taking them and before I tried, I wanted to see if there was anywhere/anyone I could talk to about their experiences on the drug and any perhaps any suggestions they could offer about managing short-term (6-9 months) antidepressant medication? I've looked at the sub-reddit rules for this group and I'm not sure if this crosses rule 3; if so, can someone help me find the right place to ask my question(s)? ",biggest_failure.txt

1,"While I was reading other friends' blogs that I realized to just be myself... I really don't think I've ever done that before, not in the 14-almost 15- years that I've been alive.  It's hard to imagine, I know, but it's true!  Zac's writing awakened me... he showed me, not trying to, how to be myself.  So here it goes:  I like a guy, named Eric and supposebly he likes me back the same way-according to Erin.  I just hope he didn't lie and was telling the truth...

0,i'm not really sure what i want to say here. I was sexually abused by my brother from the age of 4 until i was about 17. He hung himself when i was 20. i'm 34 now and just finding it hard to get a handle on life. I never really thought of what happened to me as being a big deal but my partner has made me think again about what happened in the past. my most formative years were disrupted and i believe i am still suffering as a result. I suppose i am just wondering if anyone has any advice or knows of anyone who was in a similar situation. I am in counseling at the moment and am just starting to face my demons. I came off my depression / anxiety medications. i felt they were stopping me from really feeling and i felt i needed to be fully aware of my feeling in order to work through this and be able to let go. at the moment i don't see an end to all this. ,izzy56_e_2_b_c3s_xx.txt
0,"This is a great topic. It looks like people associate with what was shared. I was laughing a little because for awhile I was so hypersensitive to sound I would not even consider turning anything on that created noise, even the noise from lights was too much. I used to go to a counselor who had a radio on in her waiting room. I could not stand it and used to turn it off. Then someone would turn it back on, having no understanding of what it was like to be me at that moment. That's funny to me now. I still don't like noise but I'm lucky since I have pretty good control over my environment. For awhile I was working in cubicles and was not sure I was going to make it. The one comment I wanted to share was what I experienced when I did turn the TV back on, read the newspaper, listened to the radio. I went without it for two years. What I experienced was the way the news was presented. I was captivated not by the words or circumstances of stories, but the tone of voice, the selection of what sound bites to use, the background chosen for a shot. I'm still fascinated by all that and even dreamed the other night I had been hired to be that person who decides how to present something. In my dream I was having a moral dilemma. My integrity is important to me and, in my dream, I was talking to my boss and trying to explain the emotional angst I was in. She kept saying, give them what they want, who are you to decide what is best for them. I woke up before I decided to quit or stay. But those words stayed with me through a day, who am I to decide what's best for someone else? What I do now is selectively listen to the news. I like NPR and sometimes enjoy McNeil Lehrer. I find if someone is expressing a strong opinion I will get annoyed if the presentation does not also include an opposing viewpoint. My main issue is selective presentation. I feel disrespected if someone is asking me to just trust them. I want to know what are the observations leading to a conclusion. I want to know what level of uncertainty there is. I don't like anyone telling me how to think or feel. I'm perfectly capable of creating all the drama I could ever use, on my own. I'm not clear where to place blame for all the drama the industry of information puts out there. I know someone is to blame. If only I could find that person or group then my hatred would be perfect. I'm kidding about that last sentence. I'm just trying to get a rise out of someone reading my share--I'm being frisky. I support public broadcasting and free speech. If I was in charge meetings would last forever because everyone would get a chance to speak. Wouldn't it be great if there truly was free speech in America. Wouldn't it be great if the principle of dissent was truly an American ideal. Isn't it supposed to be? ",dawgdean_e_1_b_1_us.txt

1,"Should I cut her loose? Hi everybody! First time posting over here, so let's go. What would you think of a friend who discusses everything with other friends? For example, if I do something that irritates My friend she tells her other friends about this instead of taking it up with me. Recently we had a fight and I know she has been telling some of our mutual friends about it. I firmly believe that if two persons have a problem they should talk it out between them without having to involve other people. This way of acting is only driving me further away from her.

0,"Having a really bad stretch of days.. Hi all, I know this sub moves kinda fast but I just wanted to vent, hopefully some of you read this.. So my story is that I've had depression and social anxiety for about 15 years or so (at least that's when I recall starting to feel ""off"".. I'm 29 now).. Because of my poor decision to bottle things up and accept that I'm unhappy I put off seeking help until about a month or two ago in which I started going to therapy. It had taken a rather bad mental fallout that occurred in early December for me to finally reach out for help. In my sessions we've been working on techniques to combat both my SA and depression, these include going to places alone such as coffee shops, yoga classes, shopping malls, etc. (Keep in mind I have ""functioning"" social anxiety where I can physically be around people but I'm extremely uncomfortable the entire time and have a very difficult time interacting with people).. The thought process being that my depression stems from loneliness and my SA contributes to that.. It's been a big step for me to try and go out on my own, but I've been doing it almost every day even though it doesn't seem to be creating any improvement. Unfortunately the last few days have been incredibly difficult, I'm getting a very sick feeling of hopelessness and worry that my life is now just constantly shuffling around desperately trying to find something in the world that will ""fix"" me. I tried to sit at home last night to give myself a break and I couldn't even do that, I started becoming consumed by those bad thoughts and began having a panic attack.. So I decided to just go drive aimlessly even though we were in the middle of a snow storm.. I feel miserable again today and I'm just running out of steam to keep going, I really don't know what to do anymore.. I'm exhausted from constantly forcing myself into uncomfortable public situations but at the same time my home feels like a prison.. I have nobody to talk to or gain support from anymore, the couple of friends that I have all have their own lives with wives and kids and my family has been out of my life for 10 years and for good reason.. I know nobody has answers as to what I should do but I just needed to rant ",ThackCankle.txt

0,"My Daughter turned 30 today.  I called and sent her a card, but she is not speaking to me.  Reason being ... I've helped her and her husband financially for approximately 2  years with the child care payment for my lovely grand daughter (she is 3 years old). I explained to both of them (daughter and her husband), that I'd have to quit paying half the payment (273.00 per month), after I get my 2005 tax return, because I'm planning on buying a new car.  I need a smaller car, and the one I own is from 1995 SUV.  I gave my older car to my nephew in Arizona.  He was driving a 1985 Toyota with no air conditioning.  He is thrilled to recieved my 1995 Passport (Honda), that has many miles, but no serious problems. I was babysitting my lovely granddaughter one Saturday night.  When they came home from a party. My son in law stunk of weed and he was drunk.  He was hugging his daughter (my granddaughter), while he was stoned and drunk.  I was so disappointed.  I come from the old school that pot is bad. Being that my daughter was promoted to full time, and they both received a total of 2,000.00 tax return, I figure this is a good time to let them know that I'll no longer be paying for half their child care. My daughter blames my decision on the night her husband was very stoned ... I tell her that I can't expect ""the best"" for my granddaughter, when her own father doesn't care, as much as I do.  Plus, I had forewarned her that I'll be buying a car soon.  So ... now I have a new car .. but no daughter, and not granddaughter.  None of them are speaking to me. I miss my daughter so much, and my granddaughter even more. please advise. ",sadness333_e_2_c_c3f_xx.txt

1,"Me [28F] and my husband [29M] don't want children. His parents disagree with our decision so much that they want him to divorce me. For the past year, I've been weathering constant and continuous passive-aggressive attacks from my husband's parents. This issue has largely stemmed from our refusal to have children. They have also been contacting my parents, stating that they have issues with things we've said/done (mainly baby-related) and when we've tried bringing up the issue they lie and say they don't know what we're talking about and act like we're overreacting/being crazy/too sensitive. Recently, after his parents did and said multiple things in a short period of time, my husband tried to confront them again (not for the first time). During the conversation, his parents said some truly horrible (and in my opinion, unforgivable) things about me: They said that my refusal to have children (which my husband totally supports, and agrees with as he also doesn't want children) made me an abusive, mentally ill, toxic person and told my husband to divorce me. They also gave him an ultimatum: them or me. The conversation was not received well by my husband, and he, of course, chose me. He's very angry with his parents as they've refused to listen to and respect his wishes. However, they then decided to contact my parents to inform them of the mentally ill, toxic, abusive daughter that they'd raised because I wouldn't give them grandchildren. My parents, of course, were bewildered and tried to explain that we were happy, and that if we didn't want children, that decision should be respected. My husband's parents have not taken kindly to any of those suggestions. My husband and I have been together for five years, and are coming up to being married for three. I have made it clear to everyone involved that I don't want children, and I never have. My husband agreed and has always supported and agreed with this decision. At the moment, no one is really speaking to anyone, and I'm taking it rather hard. It's devastating to realise that his parents only ever liked or valued me as a 'person' when I was a uterus that was potentially giving them grandchildren. To hear from my parents that they're furious that I've disrupted the plans that they had for their son upsets me on so many levels that I can't even explain properly. I am no longer sleeping or eating properly. If it were me, and they weren't my husband's parents, I would cut them completely out of my life and never speak or associate with them again. While my husband feels like this is a great solution, I also feel that they are still his parents, and no matter how angry he currently is, he's going to want a relationship in the future. My question is - how do I do? How can I try and move forward with people who literally won't accept me unless I bear them grandchildren? How can I ever let go of the fact that they've made it abundantly clear to me, my husband, and my parents, that they view me as a uterus, not a person? I want to do the right thing by my husband and be supportive, but I'm completely lost in this situation, and I have honestly no idea how to move forward. --- **tl;dr**: My in-laws won't speak to me because I don't want children. They've threatened my husband with an ultimatum (them or me) and have insisted he leaves me immediately. What do I do? What advice is there for trying to move forward - especially with people who won't address me unless I give them grandchildren? ",lucylululemon.txt
0,"I'm new here. But, I would like to know how to tell if I'm in depression. I have no idea where to post this at, but since I'm new here I guess this is the best place. Plus I can't start a new topic so... Well, anyway, here's how it is: Some days I can go without thinking about her, but at night, when I rest my head on my pillow, she eventually runs across my mind. When I say she, I mean my ex. More like.... I'm her ex. But eh... this took place a while back. Maybe like.... a year and a half. I met her 3 years ago in High-school. She was my very first true girlfriend and I didn't want anything to mess that up, but somehow I did that myself... or something along those lines. After a while of missing someone it doesn't really matter who was the blame for what. Sometimes when I make music I sing lyrics about her and how I want another chance and whatever. I'm not really obsessed with her or anything, but I sometimes want to just forget about her all at once, or wish I could go back 3 years. I guess that might be linked to regrets? Anyway, this whole thing is sort of an ON-OFF type thing, where sometimes I can't help but think about how it was, and sometimes, she's that last thing on my mind. Sort of like I put her on the back of my mind not to think about her, and save my hurt of later?? ... If that sounds right... Maybe I need a shrink. Who knows.... maybe i just need another girl.... But I'm pretty sure no other girl is going to want to listen to me talk about my past relationships. Anyway, feedback is appreciated ",clayjrjr2_e_1_a_1_xx.txt

0,"NOTES FOR A SUCCESSFUL EFFEXOR WITHDRAWAL After doing research on this board and others, I prepared the following withdrawal regime and carried it out, making slight adjustments as I went along.  It worked for me, although the withdrawal was not easy.  I share it with you all in gratitude for all your advice and sharing over these past months. I hope it will be a help for you preparing to come off Effexor 1. MY SITUATION: a. Length of Time of Effexor: 5.5 years b. Dosage: 150 mg XR c. Reason for Effexor: TMJ, myofascia and migraines due to a displaced jaw disc, lock jaw and stress. d. Other medications: Flexeril (periodically over the years but not in past year when things are ""bad""); Trazodone, for sleep; vitamins and herbs as needed. e. Status: Age: 43, Height 5'-10""; Weight: 160. Married, no kids, work from home. f. Reasons to Come Off: Generally feeling better with the help of physiotherapist; life situation has become low-stress and stabile (secure job, good marriage, work from home); side effects of Effexor becoming irritating, especially the emotional distance from my own thoughts / emotions; and simply feel that I cannot be on this drug for the rest of my life. 2. MY WITHDRAWAL REGIME Procedure: Drop my dosage by 18.75 mg (XR) every two weeks. 4 months total time to get to zero. Divided 37mg pills into two parts to equal 18.75, depositing each part in new empty vegetable gel caps (available at health food store). In general: a. No caffeine -- not even decaffeinated coffee. b. No alcohol. c. Exercise every day (heartbeat up for 20 minutes or more). d. Steam Room / Sauna / Hot bath or long hot shower every day. e. 40-50 hour work weeks, nights / weekends off for ""down time"". Daily: a. Vitamins (one dosage each in the morning and night): B Complex (50 mg); C (1000  mg); E (400 iu); Omega (2000 mg); Glucosamine Sulfate; 8 glasses of water. b. Continued with my Trazodone medication for sleep during entire tapering process, took no Flexeril. Experience during each tapering of 18.75 mg: First 24 hours: no side effects. 48 hours: very bad day: grumpy, anger, rage (for someone relatively sweet natured); nausea, dizzy, balance problems, headache; when moving head too quickly would become nauseous; body pains, disrupted sleep with periodic nightmares. The main thing is to be as far from other people as possible since any conversation would rub me the wrong way. Asked wife to take nothing I say personally, agree with whatever I say, or simply ""get out of my way"". Eventually we found sending her away for the day shopping or whatever to be the best. On these days I would plan to do a lot of non - thinking busy work around the house: fix things, garden, etc. Spent extra time at gym and in steam room. 72 hours: very low energy, dopey, foggy, wanting to stay in bed, body pains. My energy would then slowly gain over the next few days. Some of the above side effects would appear briefly without warning between drops in dosage (anger, bad nights sleep, sluggish). Once at zero mg.: Symptoms:  All of the above, but slightly increased in all areas. Acute allergy symptoms -- sneezing, headache, stuffed up from morning to night -- aches and pains. I took Benadryl during this time which helped a lot. Detox Period: Now I had to remove the toxins from Effexor from my body. Regime: a. Steam Room / Sauna / Hot bath or long hot shower twice every day--with cold shower breaks in between heat sessions to mimic the aspects of fever. b. cleanser: Triphila and Psyllium husk powder twice a day c. Dry brush my skin (the skin holds a 1/3 of the body's toxins) d. 5 day juice fast, with 2 days before and after of raw vegetables/fruits only. Stopped all medications, vitamins, benadryl, colon cleanser, everything during this juice fast. I scheduled the fast approximately 2 weeks after stopping Effexor. e. Exercise regime every day. 3. AM I NOW IN THE CLEAR? Here I am 4 weeks after the end of Effexor (and Trazadone -- which I replaced with melatonin). I continue to take vitamins and will do so for quite a while. So ... How am I feeling? - I don't have words to describe how wonderful it is to have my feelings, emotions and mind back, where I feel that my moods are my own and not manufactured by Effexor. - Allergies continue to haunt me daily, but each day it gets a bit better, and I take less benadryl. - No need to remember pill times is wonderful, less dry mouth. - Still a bit ""low energy"", but it gets better each day. - Mood is upbeat, feeling hopeful and looking forward to clear windshields everyday! I hope this help those of you out there planning to come off this drug. I am grateful for Effexor for all it has done to help me over the years. I wished they warned me about the withdrawal. I am grateful for all your suggestions and comments that helped me research and put this regime into place. It worked for me and I probably wouldn't change a thing if I were to do it again.

1,"A letter of complain  Dear Ms Tang, I really must have to complain about the summer camp that organized by your company. I was one of the first students from my school to go to this camp. Expecting a relaxing camp, the camp was totally a disaster! There were many problems in the camp, such as there were holes on the tents, all the sport equipment was broken, foods were horrible and a very dirty beach.  On the first night of the camp, it rained. So we decided to stay in the tent to play some card games. However, there were holes on the tents! The rain dropped through the holes and made us all wet. Also, it made us unable to sleep and even so, some of my classmates had caught a cough after that night.  Finally the rain had stopped on the next day, therefore we all got out and wanted to enjoy some sports activities. When we got to the sport equitmenp room, we found that all the things were broken. We couldn't play football because the football had a hole and so do the basketball. We also couldn't play the tennis because we couldn't find the tennis ball. All the things there were like a mass and made the room just like a rubbish room. At that day, we did nothing until noon and all of us were bored.  Hoping for a delicious lunch, the food was awful. The food was badly cooked. For example the fish had bad smell and seemed that it had been cooked a long time ago. The soup was the most horrible dish. The color of the soup was black! We didn't want to eat them, but we were all hungery and there were no restaurants nearby, we had to eat them. In the afternoon, many of us felt sick and had a stomach-ache.   The advertisement of this camp said that there would be a beautiful beach near the camp site for us to swim. However, the beach was terrible too. The beach was full of cans, glass bottles, paper and so do the see. We all disappointed about the camp and we all thought that this was the worst camp that we even had.  I was totally not satisfied by the services that provided by your company and we are claiming the total cost that we spent on the camp which is totally five thousands six hundred dollars. If you don't give us the refund, we will take further action by sending complain to the consumer Council.  I'm looking forward to receiving your prompt reply.  Yours faithfully, K. Ng. K. Ng.

I'm older so I don't have the time to go screw around and repeat classes and I'm sick of school as it is. I hate the uphill battle, just barley hanging on. Why? I did great in high school with a 3.5 GPA. and I made straight A's a couple times in middle school. Other people breeze through school and it makes me angry that it's such a struggle for me just to get C's in college. I'm sick of this I want it all to end, and I still have a whole year after this semester. And even that's not a guarantee the way things are going. Just needed to rant. ",javanbali_e_2_b_c3w_us.txt

0,"Hi all... this is going to be a long post, but I'd really like some feedback on it... I'm kind of young, 17. I'm currently involved in a relationship (long distance) with a boy who's a year older than me, and I love him more than words can say. The thing is, though, I'm a very depressed person sometimes.  I don't know if I'm making this up or if I actually read this somewhere, but I'm what I've heard classified as a ""seasonally"" depressed person: I experience depression more during the winter months (December through February) than I do any other time of the year. I have a lot of family problems that compound to my depression as well. When I was 13, I moved halfway across the country and I never accepted living here. I'm a city-girl, but I moved to the country. I feel isolated and alone out here, and I don't have anyone to talk to. My mother told me to ""buck up"" and ""get over it"" when I went to her about my depression a couple of years ago. She's currently on medication for her own depression. My father has a crippled arm (which he gained when we moved here) and has some addiction problems, so I don't go to him.  I have a very hard time trusting people. My mother and father were both abused as children, and my mother verbally abuses me. Recently, starting in about December, I started wanting to hurt myself physically again. The urge faded, but the depression lingered. For a while I've been emulating my mother on my boyfriend--I keep taking out my own anger and my own depression on him. I'm afraid that if I keep up with this behavior, I'm going to lose my boyfriend to my own selfishness. A lot of the time I wish I could disappear. I don't like being seen by people and I like to be alone, but at the same time I feel isolated in my soul. I tried religion, but I can't bring myself to place my faith in something I can't see. I'm really afraid that my depression is going to cause me to lose the one thing I even care about at all anymore in the world. I don't know what to do. My parents won't help me, my teachers don't know how to deal with it, and I've been to depression forums like this before and they really helped. I guess all I'm looking for is someone to lean on while I get through the winter months. If anyone has any suggestions for a homebody (my parents don't allow me to leave the house after school is over), please let me know. Also keep in mind that I can't call people very easily with eavesdropping people in my house. Thanks. Sarina ",sarina0416_e_2_a_1_xx.txt
1,"Yup, today was just 'one of those days'.  Everyone has them, they are inevitable, along with many other things in life.  I woke up late, and isn't it funny, it seems that most days when u start them off bad by sleeping in when you shouldn't, they just go downhill from there.  It's true, observe your day next time you wake up late...  but it wasn't the small annoyances that made my day 'one of those days'... these small things such as being late for work, the kids being off, tripping over EVERYTHING, breaking my cell phone (on one of the trips ), and losing my keys just made the bigger things in my life... much BIGGER today... As I look on my life right now, it seems like utter chaos, and I don't like it.  I am trying to be strong, but lately I just don't know.  How do you gracefully walk away from someone you love no matter how right you KNOW it is, especially when you are sending them straight into the arms of someone else?? Between this, and many other things going on, I , for the first time in my life, feel completely lost.  And I spend a lot of time trying not to feel sorry for myself, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  I don't know how people can deal with so much WORSE, and it happens. Daily and in tragic ways.  So,this pattern of thinking does put things in perspective b/c my life isn't exactly tragic, but my sentimental side tends to still succeed in getting in the way.

1,"I cut off my best friend because she was a flake NOW she wants me back ( Am I wrong for declining?) **TLDR**: I cut off my Best friend of 5 years for being flakey and unreliable this summer. She tries to guilt trip me into taking her back. She bought me a gift while visiting in Korea and wanted to give it to me this Saturday. I said ok at first but sent her a text this morning declining the gift and the offer. I feel guilty. Am I wrong? **Long Story (detailed)**: My friend and I had been friends since high school ( I am now 23 and she is now 21). I ended our friendship this summer after giving her numerous chances over the years. Long story shortish, she would never keep her word when it came to meeting up, she was super inconsistent and only really reached out when it was convenient for her. She would always be ""too busy"", she'd change our plans to hang out with others, or she'd flake out all together and not call or show. We both went to separate colleges in different towns so meeting up was hard and hanging out regularly was pretty difficult. I was always the one who would reach out to see how she was doing and I was always the one to initiate are hang out sessions. We would make plans to meet up a month in advance and the week of our planned day, she would flake out. After a while, I started calling her out and she would beg and cry exclaiming that she would change, but she never did. I would text her and she'd never text back. I called her once after a hard day at school and she rushed me off the phone but whenever she would call me for help and advice I was always there front and center ready to listen. I would ask her to help me out and she bail at the last minute due to scheduling conflict or her failing to think ahead. I once asked her to pick me up from the airport. I asked 3 times if she was sure if she could and she reassured me that she'd be able to. A couple of days before the day that she was supposed to pick me up, she calls me talking in circles only to tell me that she couldn't do it. I was broke and couldn't really afford a lyft. Luckily I was able to reach my dad. Over the summer things got even worse. She turned 21 and I had tried several times to link up and take her out. She bailed both times. The first time she bailed because I guess she forgot that she needed to pick up her aunt from the airport. The second time she made date night plans with her boyfriend. It continued to persist. she was teaching me how to drive but didn't think enough of me to let me know when she was going to cancel. Instead, she ghosted me for a week only to blame it on the fact that she was too busy to text me or call me. In September, I had had it! I deleted her on facebook and i blocked her number. She added me back a week later and then I blocked her. Feeling bad, November I reached out one last time to see if we could talk things through. She said that she missed me and was too sad to talk in person and that she need time to process what happened. I rolled my eyes at the text and said whatever. Toward the end of the month (November 19th to exact) she reaches out to me telling me about how sorry she is how awful of a friend she was. I vented my frustrations and she said apologized and alluded to wanting yet another chance. I said ok and we planned to meet on December 22nd. A few days before December 22nd, she texts me saying that the 22nd didn't work for her. She tried to place the blame on me by saying that I knew that she had job training that day and that I should've picked another day. I went off, She begs, I say whatever. Sometime goes by and we talk again and I explain everything that is on my mind. I tell her that its cool to be busy but its also important to make time for the people in her life. She didn't really respond because I guess it was finals week on her end. I told her that I would always be there for her and I wished her the best of luck. On New Years she texted me telling me that she had been thinking about me and she wished me a Happy New Year. I did the same. A few days later she texts me saying that she bought me a gift in Korea (where she had been visiting) and I said ok? I was a little irritated because I know that it was just another nice-nice sappy guilt trip manipulation ploy. We settled for meeting up on Saturday. however after thinking about it, I texted her today and told her that meeting up isn't a good idea. I told her that while she is a very sweet person and that I appreciated the gift, I do not trust her. I told her that I have since moved on and healed from the situation. I included that if she wanted to speak on the phone on Saturday that we could but outside of that I would not feel comfortable meeting up and hanging out. She texted me back a little short saying ""Oh ok"" and she asked if she could text me later. I said sorry and told her to take care. *Am I wrong? I feel a little guilty for how messy this entire thing has been but Im over feeling used and manipulated. She thinks that if she ""gives"" me gifts and or cries and begs for me to give her another chance that I give in. I mean it this time.. Ive gone back on my word so many times with her because of guilt and not wanting to seem like a bitch. She doesnt have many friends and I was kind of her should but she always had a hard time returning the favor. Should I meet up with her and accept the gift? Or should I just let sleep dogs lie???* ",SaitamasFist1994.txt
0,"Every Day is Exactly the Same. I'm Lonely, Worthless, and Done With Life Every day, I wake up, go to work, come home, and go to sleep. That's basically it. That's my life. Sure, I have a few friends that I see on the weekends, but it only helps so much. My ex girlfriend broke up with me and moved out of our apartment 6 months ago now. The almost three years we were together were the only time in my life where my depression was pretty much nonexistent. When she came home that day and told me she was done, I was floored. I had no idea that she felt the way she did, and she wouldn't even discuss the matter with me. I've tried meeting other people since then, and I've gone on exactly three dates with one person. That's it. I'm basically invisible to women, and no amount of effort will ever change that. I just have to accept the reality that I hold absolutely no value in a romantic context. Why? I don't know. Maybe it's because my generation is only interested in people who are aesthetically in the top tier, or make the most money. Maybe it's because my generation is eschewing committed relationships in favor of having fuck buddies left and right, whoring themselves out to whoever will get their rocks off, both men and women are at fault for this. I don't think I'm a particularly unattractive guy, and I make a pretty damn good amount of money for my age, but since I'm not in that top 10% of men, I'm just always going to be passed over and there's absolutely nothing I can do about it. It's almost like there something inherent to my existence that prevents me from having any intimacy. No matter how much money I make or how much I improve myself, that intrinsic quality of my being will always hold me back. I didn't ask for this, but it's the way things are, so I've pretty much given up completely. I don't have any plans of offing myself or anything like that. But every day, it gets harder and harder to convince myself that I actually have anything worth living for. The one thought I keep coming back to is how scared my cat would be if I gave her to a shelter or how she'd get by if I were gone. I love my cat, and she doesn't deserve to be put in a situation like that. I feel like she's the only thing keeping me marginally together. The thought of causing her any distress breaks my heart, and one of the big things on my mind all the time is simply making sure she's happy and feels safe. I feel worthless and frustrated. I wish I understood how to achieve what I want in life and be happy, but I guess that's just not in the cards. I can't wait until the day I die, I'll finally get some goddamn peace and quiet. I'm so tired of feeling broken. I'm so tired of constantly being reminded that there's something wrong with me, like I'm some sort of bastard aberration of what humans are supposed to be. I've struggled with this for 12 years now. I don't know how much more I can take. ",Judge_of_Java.txt

1,"Roomie read a text I sent about her on another friends phone So I'm gonna delete this right after but I kinda fucked up bad... I'm a 24 yo female btw living in an apartment w 4 other ppl. Ok so I came home from a stressful night and one of my roommates was drunk af, I left to go see a friend for a bit and when I returned there was a pot of mac and cheese sitting on the stove with the burner on high and no one was around... turns out drunk roomie started cooking then abandoned it there. What annoyed me more was that it was my mac and cheese she cooked and burnt. I understand we get drunk and we take our roomies food... it happens ok, I've done it (rarely) but yeah it happens. I was mainly annoyed that the stove was on high and left unattended while she went out partying! If I wouldn't have come home it could have started a fire. SO me being the idiot I am, I sent a text to our other roomie just explaining that I was a bit annoyed that our other roomie left the stove on and was also using my food wo asking. It wasn't shit talking in my opinion, as the text legit said.. ""I just came home and _____ left the stove on and burnt food and left it there and it was also my food so I'm a bit annoyed"" Me and said roomie had been talking earlier about how we were a bit annoyed she came home so drunk and loud. I legit just said I was a bit annoyed bc she left the stove on and used my food. But I wasn't like incredibly mad I was just venting bc I know I'd get over it in an hour and just tell her tomorrow not to leave food unattended or ask if she'd like to take some of my food.... SO here's where im dumb.... my other roomie left her phone in the kitchen and the message must have popped up or the other girl was snooping through her phone and saw it.... she then proceeded to text me bitching me out and sending awful passive aggressive texts. I remained calm and mature and just explained that yes I was a bit annoyed, but I didn't send the text to be malicious or shit talk, and that I wasn't mad at her. She turned it all around on me and now I'm left feeling like the mean person. The only person I normally vent to about friends is my sister and no one else.. I don't like ""shit talking"" but everyone gets annoyed and needs to vent from time to time. It's healthy to get it off your chest and I didn't mean for her to see it... also it wasn't a mean text or anything....and also she was the one to disrespect me so I feel I had a right to be annoyed, though I shouldn't have sent that text but it could be a lot worse ...

1,"A Long Story So here’s the situation I was and still sort of am in a group of four friends (friends for about 3 years). One of our four was a new girl who we added to the group about half of a year ago. But a few weeks ago three of us pranked the new girl’s best friend, it did not go well and suddenly the NG stopped hanging out with our group (we hangout but mostly play games online). But what I wouldn’t learn till the following week was that she wasn’t hanging out with me and rest of the group was hanging out her behind my back. They lied about having things to do, or saying the were simply to busy to spend time together. When we did hangout the other two and I they both acted odd and withdrawn, I attempted to dig into why and even asked if it specifically related to NG but I got backlash for doing so so I let up. However later I learned about her not wanting/being to hangout with me was a “intervention” where the three of them sat me down and told me that NG’s BF old her that She couldn’t be friends with me anymore because her BF told her that it was all my fault and she had to choose between me and her BF in addition I learned that why my friends had been harsh and avoided me earlier in the week, they had lied to me about the whole situation. They knew about the ultimatum that NG’s BF gave her the whole week and decided not to tell me till now, they claim it was to save my feelings but it didn’t come off that way. The “Intervention” ended with her leaving and me leaving as well. The next couple of weeks are bad not only is our group divided, I am the odd man out they spend the bulk of their time with NG and ignore me for the most part. So I confront my two friends (one I’ve been friends with for five years and the other three), I tell them it’s unfair that I am getting the short end of this situation when she made the decision to break up the group, I also tell them that the fact that they were willing to lie and go behind my back is wrong and that they justify it by claiming that NG is the victim because she lost a friend (so did I). They have apologized for the lying and going behind my back but I told them that I don’t feel comfortable with them spending time with her and being friends with all the problems she caused me and their easy willingness to lie for her to me. They tell that they will always be friends with her and that I can’t ask them to cut her off because it would divide the group, even though she already divided the group by pushing me out and they did nothing about it as a matter of fact the backed her up and supported her decision. So I told them that I have too walk away from the group then because I don’t feel valued, respected, or able to trust them after what they have done. Am I in the wrong? What should I do should I walk away? I don’t want to throw away my two closest friends but I feel like they don’t even care about me anymore. I apologize for the long post. ",DAran67.txt

He had been my father since i was 2. how could he betray me like this and hurt me. how could he take away my childhood. from that i learned that in the end everything will be bad and nothing is ever what it seems. I had to grow up so fast, i had to realize how the world really was. i had to lie and keep secrets. I learned to hide everything even myself, even my soul. It took me 8 years of pain and suffering. of growing, thinking and knowing. of wishing, hoping and dreaming. to finally speak up. To finally show myself. to make my soul vulnerable. To cry a million tears that i could never cry before. but now that i can be me and show myself, i don't like myself.

I pretended for 8 years and now all the hurt and bitterness is showing. When and if that's all gone what will i really be like? i can't even picture myself being happy or excited.

However, I want to know if he can legally withhold the info from me. -Can he ever at anytime get copies of various personally information of mine without me knowing or without my consent as an adult? -He said in the past you are still a minor if one is still in high-school. This is probably a stupid question but I will ask it. -When I go to enroll into a new high-school would I need anyone or since I am 18 could I just do it myself.

But to be honest, I'm not very good at it. High notes, any other trumpet player will be able to understand. In the past two years, my playing has underwent some other terrible thing where I hesitate at the start of anything I play. It's 100 percent mental. I've made some strides in it, but it still comes back. For the past two years, it has made me feel like I can't even play a simple fucking melody to someone if asked. Trumpet is basically my adventure, but it seems like I just cause myself pain. I want to keep working on it, but boy it hurts my soul to suck and to keep not doing well. On top of that, I struggle with my weight. I love fast food. I know it's bad, but I use it to cope. I also would love to stop watching porn. I'm addicted to that. I've been addicted to that since I was probably in the 4th grade. I just feel trapped, like I don't have the self control or am not smart enough to discipline myself to fix these problems.

1,"So, this is the first time I have ever posted something. Been thinking about a lot lately, so this might seem to be pretty random.  Things are changing all around, but I don't really think any of it is really going to make much of a difference. Out with the old, in with the new. New managers to work with at work. New owners to work with at work. Everything is new at work, except for me and what I do. Show up, talk to agents, managers, publicists, local bands, local press, etc. Book shows, promote shows, settle shows. It's almost getting to a point where I feel like I am going through the motions. I don't get as excited as I used to about bands. I'm probably just a lit bit jaded, but I hate booking shows like W.A.S.P., and ICP and all that other crap. At least by booking these shows, I get the resources to book the bands that I like. Just take the good with the bad.  About to be an uncle for the first time. Pretty excited about that, but I'm kind of scared for my sister. I just hope that she and her boyfriend are able to raise the baby together. I think it would crush her if he ends up leaving. I know that it will all work out in the end, but I have a feeling that it might be kind of a rocky road.  Been thinking about life and love a little bit too much lately. I really miss what it's like to be in a relationship with someone. It's been two years now, and I still find myself thinking about the good times I had with Colleen from time to time. It's not that I miss her, I think I just miss the idea of having someone like her to have around. It's nice to be able to see someone everyday and not get sick of them. Someone with whom I can share my thoughts and feelings.  On a similar note, I think it's time that I start taking care of myself a little bit more. I know that with my personality, I will always want to go out and have a good time. In turn, I think it's time I get off my ass and start trying to be healthier. Thinking about giving up meat again. We shall see. I know that if I manage to lose about 30 lbs, my confidence about my appearance will be a lot higher. Probably would help with the idea of trying to date again.

1,"What’s the worst thing a friend has ever said to you? I have two stories. 1. This was a few years ago. It was near Christmas time. I had gotten my friend a $300 iPod. I was planning on giving it to her the week before Christmas. So a week prior to me giving her the present, I take her to the movies. I worked at the movie theater so the ticket was free. But I got her a few pins we sell, we got a photo at the photo booth, and we got concessions. The total was probably around $50. When I got to paying for the popcorn and candy, my coworker said it was nice of me to pay for all of it. I jokingly said “this is her Christmas present.” My friend said that it was the cheapest present. Should have taken the iPod back after that, just to be petty. But she had been in a serious car accident that year so I reconsidered that. 2. This one was recent. We live in different countries. She texted me, after not speaking for three days due to busy schedules, about how I’m lucky to not have a health issue. I thought she was just upset with her life. But she was evidently mad at me. She made it seem like I don’t deserve my Masters degree because I didn’t work as hard for mine since I didn’t have to overcome any health issues. The worst thing she said was that I keep bragging about my life, but “nobody cares about you.” She tried apologizing maybe five minutes later but I ignored it. She somehow assumed I wouldn’t be angry. After many texts, I told her that I was upset and that I needed space. She got upset that I was upset about what she said. Just because you are sick and your life feels like shit, that doesn’t give you the right to say something like that to someone and still expect to be friends. Two weeks later she told me how my happy posts were annoying her and she hated it. Blocked her without replying. Sometimes we need to let things go. The people who are your friends will never say stuff like this. ",charmishgirl.txt

0,"Depressed? Or Just in a Bad Rut? (Long Post) I've never really felt like I've had depression before. I'm turning 24 at the end of the week, and this is the first time I've honestly wondered about myself. Usually, I'm pretty happy about things, and my outlook on life has always been realistically positive. But, lately, I just feel absolutely lost. And this morning, after I got off of work, I sat and cried. I'm not much of crier at all, and the only other time I've cried in the last ten years has been at an uncle's funeral recently. This past summer, for me, was a pretty great time. I was in a relationship with a girl who really made me happy, more than any other one had before. I seemed to be having fun every weekend, whether with her or with some friends of mine or family. I had a lot on the horizon, and a lot to look forward to. I was getting ready to finish up my degree, and it seemed like things were going in the right direction. The only thing that was a problem then was that my job was a third shift job, but it was 3 days a week, and usually 11-13 hour shifts, meaning I had time to do stuff outside of it. But, my then girlfriend and another friend had solid connections that they thought could help me land a much better job where they worked, which would carry me pretty well until I finished school. Things were looking up for me. I was pretty happy. I guess things started to slip for me when my uncle got hit with a terminal diagnosis in August. At 47, and with young children, nobody in the family was prepared to lose him. And the disease, an incredibly rare degenerative brain disease, was the same one that killed my grandmother 11 years ago. We lost him in early September. The thing with this disease that nobody in the family is talking about is that, if it hits twice within the same bloodline, there's a 50% chance that living relatives within the bloodline will get it in their 40's or 50's. There's nine of us left in the immediate family, including my mother, my brother and myself. And since it's so rare, there is absolutely no treatment plan. That, for me, was a lot to process. I'm not worried about myself, but the idea that I could still be losing relatives to this disease for years sucks. It's hard enough seeing it happen twice. During this time, things started to fall apart with me and my then-girlfriend as well. I kind of hid out with her for a while, because my family was perpetually sad and in a state of distress. And since I worked nights, I was kind of isolated. Things started to hit a rut between me and her when she started her own treatment for depression. I tried to be supportive of her, while doing whatever anyone in my family needed while my uncle was sick. She really seemed happy that I was there for her, (and things really worked out since she lived so close to my uncle anyways, and I could bounce back and forth from place to place on my days off.) Both my family and my girlfriend were very important to me, and I guess helping them out made me feel good about myself, even though the situation was shitty. I kind of let school fall to the back-burner though. And I kind of neglected my other friends for a while as well. But between work, my family, and her, I was consistently busy. My uncle passed in early September, sending most of my family into a pretty bad state, and only a week later, my girlfriend decided she was done with me, because she was afraid that if she recovered from her depression with me around, then she'd equate me with happiness, and if I left her then she wouldn't be able to recover. (Which ended up being mostly a made up way of saying, I don't love you anymore, but I don't have the courage to tell you.) Obviously, it wasn't fair to her to be stuck with me if she wasn't happy with me, but there were so many better opportunities for her to break things off, and she chose the one that was the most tedious and mentally draining for me. My state of mind after it ended wasn't great at all, and I said some very mean things to her after it ended, (I guess, at the time, I thought it was constructive criticism, but it was all just mean and awful and embarrassing.) Understandably, she hasn't talked to me since, and I feel like I burned any bridge towards reconciling with her. I missed my uncle a lot, but doing favors for his wife and kids helped me at least feel like I was contributing. My mother's still kind of a mess about it, but she has my father for support. My brother had a hard time for a while too, but his job keeps him well occupied. But, lately, for me, the things I can help with anymore have been fewer and fewer. Right now, I just want to fast forward to like March or April. I don't want to deal with my birthday, since the plans I had with my ex-girlfriend are obviously not happening anymore, most of my friends are busy with work and school, and my family is still not back to being normal. Nobody seems to want to do much for my birthday anyways, which is, for lack of a better word, normal for me. When I got home from work this morning, I cried thinking about it all. I've never had that kind of emotional reaction to anything before. The only thing I look forward to in life at the moment is my night or two out with a friend a week. The holidays are going to be rough on my family, I know now that my ex girlfriend (who I still care for and would probably take back) has completely moved on from me, and the once promising prospect of a new job isn't nearly as likely as it used to be. And, school kind of got caught up in the shuffle, and I'm not where I wanted to be with that, either. I'm going to be out on my own come January, which might help, but right now I'm just dreading the next month. I feel like the things I care about are slipping further and further out of my control, and it's hard for me to deal with. I don't know if this is just a rough patch in my life, or a sign that I have a more serious problem. But right now, I have very few people that I can be 100% open with, and it's been tough. Work is, for lack of a better word, quiet for me, meaning I spend most of my time thinking, and it doesn't help much. Since I've never really had a stretch like this before where I've been as mentally drained and just sad, I'm not really sure what to do. But there's very little on the horizon that I'm looking forward to, and I'm worried about that. tl;dr: Stretch of life events, most of which out of my control, have wreaked havoc on my emotional state. I now feel kind of hopeless. Don't know if it's just a rough patch in life, or something worse. ",Outtie_5001.txt

0,"So here is my situation .. I want to go to University .. Problems: I don't have a cent to my name, parents will not give their ok on the issue and I haven't had a job in over a year and there are no prospects in the near future. I could go behind their backs and apply for a loan but I would just feel a lot better knowing they were ok with it all, I don't want money from them. Some meaningless minimum wage job is not going to make me feel good, if anything it will make me feel worse about myself. I have not accomplished a single thing in my life and feel this is pretty much the last straw to do something meaningful, but day after day there is another block and I have no means of getting around it, I'm 100% dependant on my parents (who are usually the blocks) and I hate it.

1,"HELP! my friend invited herself along to a romantic holiday i was in the process of planning with my boyfriend. I (19, F) flat with my boyfriend (19, M) and best friend (19, F).  Yesterday i bought up that me and my boyfriend were wanting to go to Aus at the end of the year in the summer as a treat. my friend jumped at this and was saying how much she'd love to go to aus as well, and how great it would be if we all went together. i have to admit i was kind of encouraging her, and talking about what we would do and how much fun it would be etc. but now she's looking at flights and hotels and asking me so many questions about it when actually i want this trip to be a thing that me and my boyfriend do, as a romantic holiday. i love my friend and it would be a lot of fun with her there but i also want this to be special and intimate with my boyfriend. we want to do our own things together. i feel so bad about this i don't want to end up ditching her or for her to feel like she's not wanted. how do i tell her this??? how do i make it clear that this isn't a friend group holiday, this is a romantic holiday for me and my bf. Tbh i wouldn't mind her coming to aus with us on the same flight and doing stuff with her there/meeting up with her to do fun stuff there....but she wants to book a hotel &amp; everything for all of us.

1,Kids- I don’t want them...is it likely I will change my mind in the future Hey all! I have felt very strongly that I don’t want children for many years now. I don’t think there is anything wrong with me not wanting kids. And I don’t think there is anything wrong with people that do want kids. I’ve been wondering how likely it is that I might want kids in the future. Has anyone not wanted kids when they were in their early twenties and then had a change of mind/heart? Just curious!

1,"OPINIONS PLEASE/SISTER ISSUE I’m a 43 year old single mom of a 21 year old son. I suffer from major depressive disorder, ocd, ptsd and anxiety. I work part time and live with my mother. I’ve had issues since I was a child. So I believe my sister and I can be jealous of each other. Her of me because I’ve had issues and me of her because she’s normal. Our father passed away 4 years ago. Which was a devastating loss for all of us. I have lived and raised my son with my parents for the last 12 years or so. My sister moved away about 12 years ago and got married had two kids got divorced, had another kid and recently got married. She is a busy mother of 3 and working full time. After my dad passed my mother and I decided to move closer to my sister and her family. I admit I have issues and my sister is the type that I feel truly doesn’t “believe” in my issues. She sees me as lazy, crazy, etc. I see her roll her eyes when she thinks I’m being too much. She never asks me to help her out I guess because of my issues. I moved here to be closer to her and I feel abandoned. She has no time for me. We are building a house together, my mom and I have an inlaw suite and my sister and her family have the main house. My mother has given them the money to put a down payment on this home. At times I am pissed especially when she throws in my face that there are certain things that I want in the building of the house that are going to cost extra. She is a hard core bitch at times. She hardly shows any love. Her job has her so tied up that she doesn’t take care of herself, sometimes puts off taking her kids to the dr, she has no time to go out with us. She can’t even take time to respond to any of my texts during the day. She makes fun of me in indirect ways, “I didn’t really mean it” when I have a memory issue (from depression treatments). But when I respond with FU it isn’t quite so funny anymore and she’s done with me. My mom is so torn she hates that we feel this way towards each other. My mom has been there for us both thru thick and thin, financially and emotionally. I just want a sister, someone who’s going to have my back once my mom is gone. I have no one else. Help me, Am I just jealous of her? How do I fix this? ",cccakes74.txt
1,I think my friends ditched me. I was recently doing a mass unfollowing on Instagram and I noticed a lot of people that I went to high school and college with are no longer following me. Same thing with Facebook. I don’t blame them because I’m boring and they are either married with kids or they’re just out to the hottest bar or club every damn weekend. I don’t drink nor am I in a relationship or married. Where does a 29 year old go to make new friends and even find the love of their life? I failed to find her in school or work. Am I just doomed to roam the planet a loner who only can have internet friends. Sure it’s cool at first but I need real friends to talk to and someone to marry for real. (Disclaimer I do talk about romance a little here but at this point I’m mostly looking for new friends since it seems everyone I ever knew have left me behind.

0,"I've always resented my mom for being emotionally abusive growing up and blamed her for my depression. But I just told her I'm depressed and she responded in the most perfect way. I feel really weird. I'm an adult now (24) and have had crippling depression since childhood. Growing up, I never had emotional support or love. I was called names and my mom took out her relationship/life issues on me. I was distant from both my parents. I've hugged my mom only once in my life. This is just one issue out of many that led to me developing a fragile self esteem and crippling depression. Over the years, with distance, we started to talk- like once a month or so. The more educated I became, the more I came to understand why she acted the way she did (although I still harbor much resentment) I'm going through a depressive episode just now. I feel so alone and I texted her out of desperation. I told her I felt alone and depressed and couldn't get out of bed to study. Instead of judging me or saying something mean....she just listened to everything and all of my symptoms. She said that she felt so sorry for me and she wished she could help me. And she told me to never feel alone because she loves me and I'm very important to her. She asked if she could do anything to help me...and I realized, yeah, if we could call each other every morning, I could have someone to talk to and tell her about my daily goals. Then I could feel more motivated to get out of bed and feel less alone that day. I just feel weird, because I don't have a relationship with her. I'm scared it's going to be awkward, but I'm desperate for any support I can get right now. I also still resent her, but at the same time understand. I don't know. It's just weird. But, I'm happy she acted this way, for sure. Edit: I also don't mean to brag or anything like that.

I’ve known B for most of my school life (we didn’t talk from K to 5th grade bc different classes and moving away). In 6th grade she was the only friend I had in academic classes and we both formed a squad (spoiler: it didn’t last). Essentially we were very close and have a lot of inside jokes. Starting last April, B started ignoring me after I told her I wanted to do an assignment sheet alone. She took it the wrong way and we ended up fighting the entire break. We made up quickly and life was normal again. Another long ass fight happened over the summer for unknown reason. Then in November, I saw B at Target with someone she hated (lets call her E) at the time (B still does). What pissed me off that B fucking cat-fished E the same week. Again, made up 2 weeks later. She’s probably the only friend that actually asks to hang out with me (I have other friends btw). B likes to play these ditching pranks when I would leave then B and her other friends would leave me. She’s also destroyed my stuff after I told her no. One of my other friends (let’s call her A) told me that she was obsessed with me that every time when hanging out with B, B would mention me and it creeps me out.

Did they ever think that i don't want to talk to them? My mother is like a roller coaster ride you cannot wait to get off of. One day she could care less that i am sick, or that i need to tell her something, and then the next day she is all, talk to me, tell me what is going on. God it can be so annoying. i know that i have a problem with my emotions, i just can't seem to control them, when i am upset, stressed, angry, sad. There are always three things that i do. First i cry, then i scream, then i run to my room, and sometimes i might knock something down. And that gets me another, what is going on talk. Two years ago my grandma died. We weren't that close and i think that is part of my problem. every time i try to go to sleep i just lay there and think about my life, and realize, there isn't that one person, you know, everyone has one, that one person that you can just call up and say, ""hey, i am in a bad mood, can you talk..."" or ""hey i just got in another stupid fight with my mom, do you have time to talk to me..."" and maybe that is what is wrong with me, i don't have someone to vent to so i keep it all inside. i mean i try and find ways to let my anger and frustration out like, i am a poet, sort of. Everyone tells me i am at least, but what they don't seem to understand is that maybe i am a good poet because i have nowhere else to let all of this out. No one can see that, no one can see that i need someone to talk to. i try and talk to my mom, but she is so busy, and that is not her fault, it isn't like she is ignoring me on purpose, she has school, she has work, she has my brother's wrestling match, she has a meeting. then i try and talk to my friends, and i know that they would listen and they would try and understand, but i don't know, i just don't feel as though they need all of my crap on their shoulders, not that you do either, who ever is still reading this. i guess it is that sometimes, i feel ignored. i turned sixteen this year. Happy Sweet Sixteen...right? i wanted to have a party, i wanted to go out and have a good time. But that didn't exactly work out the way i had planned. At first i thought that my friends had forgotten about me, no call on my birthday, no card. And then they threw me a surprise party, nothing big and fancy, just small, just the four of us, the way we like it, but still it felt weird, it just didn't feel right. i am supposed to be driving, i have my temporary permit, i have had them since October, you know how much i have driven, about one hour. i could have gotten my license last month, but i cannot go to driving school until i get more experience, and i can't get more experience until one of my parents decides to let me drive. They used to take my brother out all the time, they would let him drive everywhere. i don't know, i just feel like sometimes being the middle child and the only girl i get ignored. i am a cutter. i tried to tell my parents three times that i was a cutter and i wanted to stop. i couldn't tell them in words so i wrote them a letter, they never read it. you probably think i am some selfish person, but i just have been holding all of this inside of me for three months now and there is more down inside of me, i just need to slowly let it out.

Her conversation, mostly murmured, not at all intrusive, continued throughout the hour or so I spent there, always addressed to herself alone, or to a figure I could not see. Every so often she went to the bar and came back with another tall glass of lemonade - or perhaps it was fizzy water. As she talked she made small jerky gesticulations with her arms in front of her; I could not hear what she was talking about n her speech was less loud than the noise from the crowded tables in the centre of the room n but the tone and volume of her conversation rose and fell; there was a sense of excitement at times, then of humor, sometimes of irritation, sometimes of the mundanity of everyday speech. The bar staff seemed to know her n one of them, a tall boy with a goatee came and chatted to her briefly. I finished my food n which was not that great n read the paper, drank another beer, occasionally watched the lawyers, ruminated, day-dreamed, and then left.

And lately I feel like they are just both rude to me and just don’t care anymore... (they aren’t friends with each other so they aren’t like ganging up on me.) I just feel like I’m less important to them. And they are both just so important to me. And I wish more than Anything I could be on my own and not need them. I’m really not sure what I’m tryin to say. Other then... I’m just not sure if I want to continue this life anymore. But I can’t kill myself. I lost my mom about a year ago. Well she’s alive... just not the same. She was in a motorcycle wreck, and she’s a totally new person. I can’t even stand to be around her. We were best friends. And now I don’t even have her. I know this sounds pitiful but I just don’t know what to do anymore.. 😞 ",pos69.txt
1,"Why is my dad like this My brother was recently tripped in the cafeteria as a joke. It was another friend and they do it to eachother all the time, but my brother ended chipping his front tooth. The two of us go to a joint middle/high school and I really appreciated all my guy friends who went up to talk to him and ask if he was ok. Today these two guys ask me when he's going to get it fixed when I have to admit to them my dad doesn't want to take him to the dentist but rather just get him a grill. They laughed so hard.

Finally there is Risperdal and Topemax - a headache medication. I tried to kill myself last spring and came very, very close. This event has opened up spiritual dimensions more terrible than I thought possible. Forgive me for sounding weird, but with my life just one little hop, one small step away from obliteration, the return back became a long journey. And most of me didn't even make it back - after the attempt I was hospitalized on a ward with a sociopath as my neighbor. I was naive and even befriended him. Far too late in the relationship I realized that this person may not have my best interests in hand. So I left the hospital but I left beaten. Then I went home to my family and some of them reacted terribly against my illness. I felt powerless, like I was spreading some miserable disease. My struggle goes on but at least I am alive. I believe in many things I never used to now, and that gives me hope. To anyone reading this, I just hope you won't toy with your life. Live a long one, it's important you do.

1,"Today is shaping up to be an extremely frustrating day.  For some reason, whenever B has Guard Duty, the kids think that it is a good time to be their most obnoxious.  And to top it all off, my period is due tomorrow which cuts my tolerance in half.  I have been so exhausted the last couple of days, I'm not sure if there is something going around or if it just the 10 years of interupted sleep that is finally catching up with me.  I have no energy and all I want to do is eat.  I need to get out and do something.  Still mulling over the idea of a move to AL.  Sometimes the thought of starting over in a new place is very refreshing and at other times, terrifying.  Truth is though, I probably don't have the drive to move this whole family.  And I know that B is pretty happy right where we are, if he got a little better job we would probably be very comfortable, and wouldn't even be considering a move.  I've done so much work with tweaking his resume and getting it out there that every time he has an interview and it doesn't work out, it almost feels like a rejection of me.  Stupid I know, and he totally takes it in stride, but I am starting to get frustrated that people don't see his potential and qualifications.  Well, I should really get busy and get something done today, there is a ton of laundry to put away and maybe I'll bake something.

For the time being he can't do anything physical, can't drive, and just looks like he's in pain, and is talking about probably retiring. Meanwhile in my life i'm struggling between choosing to go off to college or getting a full-time job. Only just a week ago I was getting ready to start to apply to FAFSA in preparation for actually starting college this year -- now with recent developments i'm not sure if that's even a viable option. I'll probably need to stay home and help out by getting a full-time job since both me and my brother are reliant on my dad financially, and my brother is already in college. I really don't know what I want to do or what I even can do. Add onto more shallow but personal reasons for me to feel down, like the fact that I have no social life to speak of and honestly it's enough to make me seriously consider suicide.

1,"My friend is ruining her frienships I'm not really sure what to do here. My best friend, let's call her Sam, has lost a lot of friendships recently. And I mean a lot. In the past two years, she's lost almost every close friendship she's ever had. The count is in the double digits. Something would happen and she'd declare them dead to her and never speak to them again. Unfortunately, I find myself usually feeling like it's Sam's fault that the friendships are crumbling. Recently, she's started shamelessly using her friends. One girl worked as a seamstress at a community theater in her free time and Sam would constantly arrive unannounced and drop off clothes she wanted tailored, imposing absurd timeline, even saying she'd be back that night to pick the dresses up. When her friend finally asked Sam to start paying, Sam announced to everyone that their friendship was over and that she refused to associate with someone who didn't view her as a friend. She's started yelling at people for not texting her more. She called one of her now former friends, an elementary school teacher, and yelled at her for not responding to her texts about where they were going to get dinner that night. She wanted to make sure she didn't eat the same type of food for lunch. The teacher cancelled and they haven't spoken since. And unfortunately, with each new friend lost, her demands on those remaining have become more and more extreme. Her need for attention has gotten out of hand. She demands that we all hang out four nights a week and constantly accuses people of not valuing her friendship enough if they can't make it. One friend spent every night with her one week trying to show Sam that she mattered. When the friend didn't continue that schedule the next week, Sam screamed at them for pulling away and called her a coward for not just ending it if she didn't want to be friends. Worst of all, she accuses people of saying things they've never said, claiming that she's stupid, she can read between the lines. And when people try to explain that they never intended to hurt or upset her, she claims that it doesn't matter what they said. What matters is how she was made to feel. It shouldn't come as a surprise that Sam has serious self-esteem issues. She's in therapy and has been for a while, trying to work on them. Unfortunately, she goes back and forth between crying that no one knows how hard it is to live with ""being such a failure"" and accusing others of not being deserving of her friendship. I want to be there for her. I want to help. She's been my best friend and she used to be able to be there for me, but I'm not sure I can handle who she's become and how she's started treating us. tl;dr: My friend has serious self-esteem issues and is ruining all of her friendships because she treats everyone like absolute garbage. She's getting therapeutic help but I'm not sure I'm able to stick around long enough for things to get better. ",discardaname.txt
0,"Have you ever cried for missing your childhood so bad? Well I often do, quite sometimes frankly. I just miss those good old days, when life was just so beautiful and easy. Nothing to worry about, nothing to cry for other than silly childish little things. My childhood was so beautiful. It was in France. It's been now a whole decade since I left France - the country I've always admired and will always do. I remember going to school, having so many friends, I felt like I'm the happiest child on Earth. Then suddenly one day, everything changed. The passing of time took away from me my childhood, my friends, my beloved France. Life suddenly just changed like that. No more joy, no more innocence, no more real friends, no more homeland. No more beautiful sunny days, only darkness, depression, nostalgia and tears. I'm trying to survive day by day through this hell on Earth. Each time those memories of my childhood flashbacks, I can't help stopping the tears that drop from my eyes. Whenever someone mentions France, I get overwhelmed. I'm living the hardest time of my life. A 10-year ""war in lifetime"", as I call it, still going on, and doesn't seem to have an end soon. I know those good old times are just memories, obviously. Tomorrow when I wake up, things will be just the same. But my hope will never die. My redemption will come, soon or late. This moment of my life will also be just memories, just like those good old days of my childhood in France. I didn't go in detail 'cause I don't think many people will be interested in my story. But if you are, I wouldn't mind sharing you the whole story, as long as you can share me yours. And how about you? Have you ever cried for missing your childhood so bad? ",portoladrive.txt

1,"My bio dad died and his family didnt tell me until 3 days later... Him and I were never very close. Probably an understatement considering our only interactions were him calling drunk and calling me dirty names since the age of 14. I believe it started at 14 because I had sent him a letter wanting to have a relationship with him. I just wanted to know my dad even if it wasn't a super close relationship I still wanted one. Well fast forward 6 years later he's in the hospital for nearly a month and no one tells me, not even his sister who I am in contact daily with. Finally he passes away last thursday. He was intubated and couldn't speak for most of his hospital stay. He was 39. I asked his side of the family why nobody told me he was in the hospital or why nobody told me died the day it happened. Their reasoning? I had vented at a few points saying I wished he was dead (normally after he would call me drunk and call me a whore and talk shit on my mother who raised me since birth). I am also not invited to the service. Should I feel duped? Should I feel cheated out of a chance to say goodbye even though we weren't on the best of terms? Because his family and girlfriend sure as hell made it clear i don't even deserve to grieve. All i wanted was a relationship with him and all I got was name calling and him taking me and my mom told court over the $200 he had to pay in child support each month.

Times I thought about driving into a bridge abutment or into a truck at the last second. Absolutely crazy stuff.

0,"Well, I have to admit that as a male I've always viewed my own depression as personal weakness. I still do, I can't help it ...it's a notion, feeling or philosophy or whatever that's been instilled from an early age. I know this is not a popular or realistic way to feel about depression. I mean, it's an illness, right. I've never been to a doctor to have my condition properly diagnosed or treated. At the moment, I really can't face my doctor with that sort of issue (btw, I'm in my mid-40s and I've suffered from depression since as long as i can remember) - I've learned to cope, in a fashion, but probably at the expense of a reasonable sense of social 'normality'- i.e. divorced, emotionally empty relationships, enormous amounts of time spent alone, dissatisfied working life, etc. One covers up & disguises the depression at work, at home, and wherever/whenever necessary...and then, when you're all alone, the demons can come out to play(or even before you're alone) - but at least you maintain the expected external masculine dignity, most of the time. For example, today my son wanted to come over to visit me but because I've been feeling so miserable and morbid and soaked in ennui this week, I made an excuse to put off his visit because I didn't want him to see me feeling low & depressed(and weak) and thus ruining his day/week. Instead, I went out on a freezing 10 mile walk alone to try to physically squash the depression. This is a regular occurrence - I get depressed, I hate myself for being weak, so I do something physical to try to alleviate the symptoms(and also to punish myself for feeling depressed)... it works...temporarily. In my mind, this sort of masochism is (or has been)preferable to taking alcohol, drugs (even prescribed medicines), fags, therapy or inflicting real self-harm and so forth because, at least, it keeps me feeling physically fit-physically balanced(and I guess that's important to me) even if it's not always an effective cure for one's depression. And I can keep up the public pretence that all is well. Sorry, back to the point - yes, it seems a lot of men do tend to suffer depression in silence (one wonders what the real percentage could be!).When I joined this group yesterday it was the first time I'd openly voiced the notion that I DO suffer from depression. Not so macho. Perhaps my condition is getting worse... or maybe I'm just feeling a little more realistic about what it is to be a male suffering from depression. Are there MANY women (or even men) out there who are truly sympathetic to males who suffer from depression? Unfortunately, I haven't seen much evidence out there so far? ",paulfrank_e_1_b_1_xx.txt

1,"Is he justified for being so mad ?? Thoughts on my plan?? No judgment please?? 6 months ago I stayed with my aunt for two weeks but I really wanted to see my cousin who I’ve been talking to on Facebook.  Well,  I didn’t get to see him until like the day before I was supposed to leave and didn’t get to speak with him as the way we were seated at our gathering I’d have to literally yell across the table and I’m not like that.   So later that night I got in an uber and went to his house around like 11 pm lmfao and I told him I was coming but he was like no and he was pissed that I didn’t say much to him but I showed up it was raining, freezing, windy, etc and he didn’t let me in and so I left and went back to the airport cuz I didn’t have enough money to go all the way back to my aunts it was like 60 something miles away I only had enough to get to Newark. But he got super pissed at me and won’t talk to me blocked me on all social media but your girl is about to take that train for 5 hours and go again in like July/August but I’m not telling him I’m just gonna wait till he gets off of work.  I have zero way of contacting him other than physically going there.  Any idea what I should say so he can forgive me ?  I’m aware what I’m doing could potentially make things worse but if I leave it be we might not ever speak again.  I’ve also lost a substantial amount of weight since then and he probably won’t recognize me?  Thoughts please ?  I know what some of you might say but I really want to fix this?? ",__nopls__.txt

0,"It's been a while since I've written and I decided to start off again with a bit of a bang. I'm going to post my story of beginning recovery, this is to try and cheer some people up and to let them know that they could do it too. Well now, where to start.... About a year and a half ago (the beginning of Grade 8) is when I started to notice the changes. Not physical but emotional. I had been told many times that this was very normal for teenagers so I thought nothing of it. There was an incident with a rather immature and nasty young man, who I just happened to have an ENORMOUS crush on. Anyway we both kind of lead each other on for a while but nothing happened, than he meet this girl at a hockey game. He immediately started talking about her all the time and how he really loved her so much.  I began to feel more and more useless. After that I started rolling down hill like a circle of cheese, and by March of that year I was quite close to suicide at several occasions. This is when I started noticing that this might not be normal and tried many self-help methods, all of which failed. I thought Grade 9 could be a new beginning, it wasn't. My grades were starting to slip and I just couldn't be happy anymore. Finally after a close call in December I told my mum all about my failed attempts and how I was feeling. She agreed to get me a new doctor. I visited her and I got diagnosed with depression and was prescribed Cipralex. Of course that took a while to work too which involved me missing a lot of school, falling really far behind, and having several more close calls. Finally I started feeling a little better and was even stable enough to start going back to school and going to visit my family in the East. Well I just got back from that trip and I have never felt better. I am ready to face the world. That trip was just what I needed. When I get through these next weeks until my birthday all I can see is a varely clear path ahead! For the first time in a year and a half I can concentrate and tolerate less than perfect circumstances. I hope everyone here will feel this way, you can if you just push through! Power to us! Rock on! ",membrain_e_2_a_1_can.txt
1,"hot and cold friend I do quite a bit of online gaming on console the past year and have made some great friendships during the span of time. Some of them have developed into stronger friendships (we bond on more than just gaming). I became close with one guy in particular and I'd say he's become one of my best friends. We met each other through a mutual group but through shared interests and our ease in conversation, we became close enough to add each other on various social platforms and IM. Initially, we texted all the time but I've been noticing very recently, his texts have gotten shorter and less frequent. I get that eventually friendships can go through lulls but I feel like things have changed. I had always thought he was very sweet and affectionate; always asking about my day, initiating conversations, and just being a kind friend in general. If it's been a couple of hours and i haven't replied, he'd message me to check up. I admit it was a bit intense at first but I had gotten used to it and reciprocated. But now that he's kind of dropped off, I feel like I am becoming overbearing and that's the last thing I want to be. I feel like I'm putting in more effort to keep a conversation going these days. I've brought up the change in our interaction but he reassures me nothing is wrong yet things just aren't what they used to be. On top of that, I am starting to feel this tiny annoyance grow inside of me...I don't nearly game as much as he does so when I do come online, we usually play games together. Sometimes we play with other friends but about half the time or more, we game with each other. We don't really play in groups much because he's a bit of an introvert and doesn't feel comfortable in large group settings. The other day, I was invited to play with a friend we made online. Prior to this, my friend and I had some particularly frustrating games so he was signing off early. But me not wanting to play with our new friend alone, i told him i got an invite and got him back online pretty quick to join me...but the whole time he was kind of silently sulking until he texted me he just thought it was weird that this guy would want to play with me and that was what made him feel weird. Eventually he warmed up and started talking like a normal person so I was happy by the time I called it a night and found that all of them were bonding. These incidents have happened a handful of times in the past month and it's left me slightly annoyed and very confused. ",RDuser123456789.txt

1,"Would you still be friends? Are we unreasonable? Hello dear people of Reddit I have a small major problem in my little group of friends. My problem is rather selfish but I feel betrayed and I don't know if she is still our friend. So let's start all over. There are 5 people involved BF (My Boyfriend) Snorly (My female friend and the 'victim') Berta (My other female friend that gave me the feel of beeing betrayed) Root (Because of him kinda started everything) And my humble self. So it all begun wenn Root sexually assaulted Snorly, she was at his home, learning with him and afterwards they watched something together, she started to feel tired and was half asleep. He touched her during that period she was shocked and pretended to wake up, when he noticed he pretended to be also asleep. She told him at the beginning, we all go together to school, that she had a Boyfriend and that she doesn't want any romantic relationshio with him. He didn't stop. At a slumber party we all were together, he touched her again, and suddendly lied directly next to her. She still hadn't told us any of this. Then came the point where he told someone some really private storys of us, which we told him in secret. We ignored him for a while but gave him a 2 chance. He messed up, again. My friends had to go to a further education, I wasn't with them because I work in another company, but well there he was awfull to BF when someone asked him why their team was so slow he answered because of 'BF'. This was the limit. We wanted to have nothing to do with him anymore. Snorly told us sometimes earlier what he had done to her. He told her to not tell anyone. But she told us that anyway and his boss. Now he gives her the fault, that everyone hates him. Just to mention, Root has depressions, and has already attempted suicide. So there are also moral and ethical views on everything. We don't bully him or anything like that, we ignore him. Well, Berta still hangs out with him, she even ditches us to eat lunch with him. And no she doesn't have any romantic intrest in him but in one of his best friends. We expected her to side with us. It is selfish but I can not forgive Root for what he has done, when doesn't even apologized for his actions or stands justice. Berta doesn't care. She laughs with him, she hangs out with him af if he has never hurt us. And this, this feels like betrayl. How do you see it guys? Are we wrong? Are we to harsh? Would you want to be still befriended with a person who sides with another person who hurt you? Or are we unreasonable? Tl:Dr My friend sexually assaulted another friend multiple times and was a mayor dick to us but our other friend still hangs out with him, would you still be friends with that person? Dick has depression and has attemptet suicide. ",MadameUnskrewed.txt
0,"Feeling numb I’ve realized that if I can’t talk to someone about my feelings then the next best thing is to write them down and seek advice from reddit so here I am. I’m on campus right now preparing for my midterm and my confidence is at an all time low. I haven’t even seen the paper and already I feel as if I’ve lost. I never thought I would reach such a low in my life. Something weird happened today. I finally set up a countdown timer to the day my exam results are announced. That seemed like the next logical step and it made complete sense to me in a weird way. The only thing that made me remove that was talking to my parents and seeing the hope and love for me in their eyes. I know my life isn’t truly mine and that if I hurt myself then I also hurt other people but it’s just getting too much. The thought is always there in my mind and for the past few days that voice has gotten stronger. I’ve been through this period before and had come out nearly unharmed and at the beginning of the year I was feeling optimistic about what’s to come but that lasted all of one month. The future I was dreaming of looks bleak and distant and with every passing minute that future keeps on going farther and farther away from me. I try very hard to keep my guard up near people I know and love but it’s becoming harder and harder to do so. I used to think that I was destined to do some good in the world but maybe that was just me being delusional. It’s getting harder to keep the tears in. Whenever I used to feel numb, I used to punch the wall just to feel something but even that is not helping now. All I wanna do is talk to someone and pour my heart out but I don’t know if I have the strength left to do that. Getting out of bed is starting to feel like a struggle and for the first time in a while I’m afraid of myself, of what I might do if things don’t go my way. I know that this is not the end of the line but why does it feel like it is? How can anyone recover from such a failure? It’s gotten so bad that I would much rather prefer that I disappeared than having to tell my parents what’s wrong. Depression is nothing new for my university and it wouldn’t be the first time that someone took a drastic step and now I know why they did what they did. The pressure and stress which comes with a university as respected as mine, is just too much to handle. I’m almost inclined to reveal my university’s name just in case someone’s able to figure out who I am and I can finally get the respite I desire so much. All around me I see happy faces and I can only hope that one day I can leave all this behind me and be happy but in the meantime I guess I just have to struggle on and wait for the light at the end of the tunnel.

1,"What can I do in this situation? After graduating high school last summer, I stopped hanging out with all my friends. Some just stopped contacting me since they now live far away living in dorms and such..and others I dropped because they were fake. Sometimes I do sort of regret it, but that's only because of the loneliness and boredom I feel home alone on a weeknight. I'm currently taking a year off and I only have one close friend. I've only known this friend for a year but we got along so well. We had soo many things in common. But now I feel like he's super fake. For ex, he talks crap about his ""friends"" but then posts photos and acts all nice and friendly around them. When he talks about them with me, it genuinely sounds like he hates them and says he never wants to hangout with them..but then does??. Not only that, but nowadays whenever we hang all he seems to do is complain and judge other people. Like, at first it use to be ok..but now it's all the time. It's so toxic and just a cheap form of communication imo. He's also always late whenever we schedule a meetup. Not once was he ever on time, sometimes he makes me wait an hour because he took his time to get ready when he knows that I'm waiting for him. We also never get to do what I want to do anymore because he's ""lazy"". For ex, I really wanted to go to this cute cafe and he also did too..but then on the day of he was taking so long to get ready we ended up not having time to go. We only get to do what I want if he's benefitting from it. Just thinking about this makes me wanna go to him right now and let out all my anger at his face. I do confront him, but it's almost as if he forgets. I would tell him that I hate it when he makes fun of my body or rubs whatevers on his hands on my shirt as if it's a tissue but then a couple weeks later he'll do it. ugh. Just recently too..he was telling me about his cousin and how she literally talks crap about everyone which led to me asking if she ever talked about me. He said yes and she basically called me weird just because of my face shape. I know it's nothing serious but it made me mad because I'm super self conscious about it. But what made me even more mad was the fact that my so called ""friend"" didn't even stick up for me. He didn't tell her to stop or anything. Sorry that this turned into a rant, but I really wanted some advice. I feel so lonely. When he hangout I feel as I have to be this super fun person because he seems to talk about how his other friends are so fun when he hangs out with me. It wasn't always like this..maybe we're growing apart from each other, I don't know, but I'm purposely taking a break from him for two weeks..we scheduled a meetup for his bday but idk how that'll go. Any advice or opinions are welcome. I just want to hear what others think about my situation. Thanks. ",jkim9974.txt

I just assumed it was just life getting in the way, but recently my dad tried to contact this cousin about some money he loaned him to buy my old car (which I sold to him well under half of market value), because my dad needed the money to pay for a surgery (he has stage 4 liver cirrhosis).

0,"Hi I'm Ricky, I'm 17 years old and I think I've been living with depression for the past 2 years. I've been through a lot of issues in my life that makes my life feel so unbearable and lonely. I haven't been through any therapy so I haven't been diagnosed with depression but I obviously haven't been feeling happy. I'm a senior in high school and I hate going to school every morning, I don't feel like I fit in really. Reasons are because I'm a social outcast and I don't really like being around other people because I may seem to be off tangent. People seem to judge me too quickly and this really pisses me off, or is it that I'm way too paranoid. I zone out a lot and just stare at people without even saying a word to any of them. Like I'm really anxious around them and I feel completely uncomfortable. I started smoking weed when I was a sophomore and ever since then people such as my friends seem to drift away but it didn't really bother me till now.

I felt like it was my own fault that I felt so sad and angry and that I wasn’t good enough for other people. One day I decided that if it we’re my own fault I felt that way then I could also improve my situation. Al my negative emotions went into working hard. I finished my studies (not by working hard, but because I was good at it) and put all negative emotions into working out. I got accepted into a difficult job at the Army. Now I quit the Army because of an injury in my knees. At the same time I lost a girl, even though we only went on one date, I thought she could be the one positive thing to take from the Army and all the hard work I put in to get into the Army. So what’s my situation now? Jobless, girls still despise me, have a degree with which I can’t find a job with and all the work I put into improving my situation was for nothing. While trying to improvie myself and during my studies and time at the Army I still had periods where I felt very down. It just becomes harder and harder and harder to crawl out of it every time. The negative voices and feelings are too much and getting up to fight just becomes impossible. I had the power once to get up and try to fight. Now I don’t even have the power to suicide.

0,"I'm 46 and have been depressed since I was maybe 5 years old. I was emotionally abused by two confused parents. Depression & alcoholism runs rampantly in my family - fortunately I escaped the alcoholism. I was diagnosed as having major depression when I was about 25 and I've been on medication since then. I've also had intensive psychotherapy and done lots of research on the subject. Nothing erases the stigma!! ""Depression"" is misnamed. It should be called serotonin-deficiency disorder or something long and fancy so people will respect it. Too many say, ""Depression? Snap out of it!"" Or ""Do something to cheer yourself up."" What bunk. It affects every part of your body. Last year I realized that some of my depression was caused by kidney failure. I escaped dialysis and will probably be OK. But what a relief to have something ""serious"" to blame my problems on! Everybody respects kidney failure as a ""real disease"". I had to disown my brother last year because his reaction to my failing health was to call me a loser and an embarrassment. Very typical reaction from him, although the rest of my family were supportive. I now have no brother. I should have done it a long time ago. It takes such a long time to come to a point where you believe you deserve something good in life. I'm intelligent, employed and don't do drugs or alcohol, never have, but sometimes I feel like a bum, a worthless waste of space, not worth the effort. I have to argue myself out of that mindset every day, and it's so exhausting, and people wonder why I'm tired all the time and have no energy. I'm very angry, too. I have never had a successful relationship and don't believe I ever can. I don't even believe it exists. No kids, either, but maybe that's a good thing. They take a lot of emotional energy. Anyway, I hate to sound like a whiner, but sometimes you have got to whine!! And I'm happy to listen to everybody else and give them my support. We're all in the same boat here.

0,"I was just curious what your feelings are on long-term outcomes for depression. A little background for me: I've been on and off medicines for several years. I was always depressed as a child, but didn't really seek professional help until maybe 10 years ago. I originally went on medicines. for severe pms prescribed to me by my ob-gyn. I just kind of continued on with it because it made me feel ""leveled out"". Then I had issues with sleep apnea, joint pains etc. My neurologist put me on Effexor. Every time I tried to go off that drug I was dizzy and had bad side effects. Finally, I reduced the dose myself and weaned myself off the Effexor. I had gained a tremendous amount of weight. I was off all medicines for 8 months and then I really feel into a dark depression. It was then that I sought a therapist, etc. I have been on medicines ever since...since June of 2004. I had lost 40 pounds by going off the medicines, but then became depressed again. following several deaths and major life events. I was put on Lexapro and gained weight. Not wanting to gain weight again, I hated being on the medicines. He kept saying it will stabilize. I told him that the weight gain was making me more depressed. Finally, he changed my medicines to Wellbutrin. We talked about trying to go off medicines when life events settled down...my main reason to go off was the weight gain. Immediately the weight came back off. That was a year ago. Now a year later, I am still losing about a pound or two a month. The last time I went in, he didn't say anything about going off the medicines. How long do people take medicines? Is it just better to stay on them and not fall back into the hole? Are there any long-term use side effects to be concerned with? Is this something I will probably be on forever? It just seems like I will always be like this. It just seems like depression is always just standing back in the shadows. I go for a very long time and feel fine and then I have a week where I get very down and know that if I wasn't on medicines. it would be very bad. I haven't gone to talk to my therapist in a long while. When I am having these bouts of depression, should I call and say I need to go in for a ""check-up"". I don't really have any specific issues to discuss. The big thing right now is I just feel down because I have lost my closest friends and don't feel like I have any friends to do anything with. I feel so isolated. Would it be good to just call and go in? I just feel stupid saying I feel sad because I don't have any friends. Are there any good books that you can recommend on self-help--esp. negative thinking, understanding why I think the way I do, etc. I found Dr. Phil's book on Life Strategies to be very helpful in discovering that there are reasons why I do things and think.

My life has been one failure after another, in relationships, jobs, and anything else. I had been on antidepressants for about 10 years and then stopped after I got arrested for a DUI and felony hit and run. The man who was injured received a cut on his face after chasing after me when I split the scene, that was the whole extent of his injuries. After the arrest I was feeling so bad it made no difference whether I took them or not. The charges were dropped but I had to wait day after day for a year or more just waiting for them to recharge me, which my attorney was sure they were going to do. That was 2 years ago and I think the experience did some very serious and real damage to me. I just lost my job in my probationary period of 2 months. I have worked so hard to create some kind of financial security for myself (BA in Psychology, technical degree in computers, numerous computer certifications) but where ever I go I don't fit in to the group and find myself alienated and let go. Some many failed romantic relationships, never having friends, and what family members I have are abusive and are incapable of providing healthy support. Most nights I calm myself enough to fall asleep by fantasizing about killing myself and the relief that was provide. I feel like a freak physically. I shortened my fingers on my right hand by 1/2 inch and my hand is deformed because I hit the wall in my apartment one night about 4 years ago after I was let go from a job and my girlfriend broke up with me at the same time. Of course what I have stated so far isn't close to all that is weighing on me. Now I am just so tired and hopeless I don't know how to get the energy to try again.

0,"I think I ruined another friendship TL;DR: Made a wonderful friend, had a depressive episode, and ruined the friendship by trying to force my problems on her. Just like I've done a million time before. I've had depression my whole life and I've always gone through episodes. Sometimes they're mild, and I'm just generally down for a few days, sometimes they debilitating and I can barely get out of bed for weeks. I've also never had a lot of friends. I don't have casual relationships. I either don't really think of you a friend, or I love you with every part of my heart. There's no middle ground. I've been building a friendship with a great girl from work (call her Amy) for a few months. It doesn't seem like anything romantic is gonna come from it, but it was nice to have a friend I could do stuff with. We went hiking, rock climbing, we even went on a scuba trip to the Caribbean together. I'd opened up to her about my depression and she seemed really understanding. She actually seemed to appreciate how open and communicative I was about it. The day before the Super Bowl, I felt an episode coming on. It wasn't severe, but it made me fragile. I'm a big Patriots fan, so when the Pats lost, it set me up for a bad episode. If I'd just been sad about the Patriots Monday and let myself heal like I usually do when my teams lose, everything would have been fine, but instead I started to blow my friendship. I texted Amy Tuesday that I was feeling down and I'd like to see her. I made a big deal about how I wasn't crying about the Pats, but I was having an episode. It seemed important to me to point that out for some reason. She said someone was visiting from our India office and had a ton of work for her, but she would try to come over after. She worked until 930 that night and never made it. Wednesday I left work at 10am because I was too down to stay. I was texting her the same stuff throughout the day, how I was sad and I wanted to see her. She worked until 930 again and didn't come, but this time she had never promised to. I texted her this big apology about how I've been a shitty friend and I'm sorry for forcing my problems on her. At work Thursday she told me to stop apologizing for everything. I told her I would try to stop. Friday just felt different. She was less talkative with me than usual. She brought me cookies she made, and I thought that might be a sign that things were getting better, but after work I asked her if she had plans that weekend, and her answer was simply ""yes"". I said have fun and left. Normally she would have at least told me she a general idea of what she was doing. I talked to my roommate/best friend (Samantha) about it Friday night. We agreed I needed to just leave Amy alone for the weekend, so I texted her and said if she found any free time I'd love to see her and then I didn't contact her again until yesterday at work. Yesterday some things happened that really made me feel like things were ending. First, we had talked about planning a trip President's day weekend, but she had a surgery and she didn't want to plan anything until it was done (that's a whole other thing that's bothering me). When I asked her yesterday, she said she thought President's day was in March and she promised to see her brother this weekend, so ""we'll see"". She also told me she likes working late and going to the gym at like 930. Apparently she's been working 12 hour days for the past week. The gym part hurt because one of my favorite things to do with her was work out, and now I've lost my gym buddy. I've had a lot of friendships go this way in the past. Speaking a little immodestly here, but when I'm not depressed, I'm funny, energetic, and interesting, and generally a fun person to be around. I've had lots of people enter my life, meet that me, like him, then after a few months meet the depressed side of me and just nope the fuck out. Amy first met the depressed me a few months ago and she didn't run away. I thought she could be a big part of my support network moving forward. But I'm worried that I just tried to put too much on her. Like I've done a million times before. The worst part is she sits right next to me at work. She's leaving next month to hike the Appalachian Trail, but until then, if I really did blow this, then I have to sit next to her every day for a month. I don't know if I can handle that. Anyway, thanks for listening to me whine about my problems. ",Throwthrow19424.txt
1,"My friend refuses to pay his 600 dollar lost wager to me. What to do? [Long text] One day, a friend and I started arguing about something. It turned into a heated but friendly discussion, and eventually we were both fed up with each other's differing views, so we both proposed a wager. We then spent the rest of the day simply arguing, but without any real conclusion, we decided to actually follow through with our wager. Before making the wager, we agreed on 600 dollars, and it was 100% agreed on from both sides. Fast forward to him losing the wager and promising to pay me within a month or so when he would get his next salary. I also felt a bit bad about winning, so I decided to call him and ask him what he would have done in the exact same situation if the roles were reversed. He said he would have taken the money. Right then and there, I decided I would also then take the money, as my friend is (or so I thought) a man of honor. During no time did I ever say I didn't want the money from him. Some time after I won, I made a little joke on facebook along the lines of: ""When am I getting my juicy money?"" with a little meme, as it would be awkward to simply tell him to pay me. He simply said: ""I invested the money into [[fucking]] ethereum [[of all things he could have done]], and it rose 16%! I probably won't pay you the money."" I thought this was a joke, but later found out he was 100% serious. Of course this made me mad - not only that he wouldn't pay me all of a sudden, but also that he broke the news in such an arrogant way. I then argued with him, saying he owed me the money and we agreed on it as two men who made a very serious wager, both knowing what we would get ourselves into. I know for a fact that I would have paid him the second I would have lost, and I have told him so many times. He now claims that it is too much to pay, that it doesn't feel right (yet he also feels guilt) and that I am being negative and should just move on. I get very mad at unjustice just like this, as could very well have lost the wager. I basically took a very unnecessary risk with this wager. I've told him I can't trust him anymore, but he seems to just want to move on, typing messages on Facebook like nothing has changed. He said he was sorry, but I don't accept the apology as he can still do what is right: pay me the money. He tried twisting this on me trying to make me look greedy, when in fact he is the one who fucking scammed his friend. What is your view on this? ",PleaseImmortal.txt

Then it's back to school for one day, then I'm off again Thursday, then school Friday, off for the weekend, school for three days then off again for six days. I don't know why they schedule two big breaks so close to eachother, but that's YTI for you. I had a pretty decent 4th. Each year both sides of my family have a picnic. They're usually on separate days, but this year they were both on the same day. First we went to my second cousin Jim's house for what is traditionally known as the ""Shinndig"" (I am descended from the Shinn family). This is attended mostly by people who I either don't know or only see once a year at this event. Afterwards, Beth and I went canoeing at Camp Blue Diamond. I hadn't been to Blue Diamond in years, but my parents used to send me there for church camp when I was a kid so it conjured up a lot of memories of not wanting to be there. It's a lot more enjoyable when I can do my own thing instead of being forced to do this or that and sing a bunch of stupid songs. We paddled around the lake for a while, enjoying the serenity of nature....or something. Then it was off to my aunt Wanda's house for picnic #2 where we ate food and watched my uncle and cousin and a couple of kids from accross the road set off fireworks in the rain. Then we headed to my grandmother's house for a little while before going back to my parents'. Overall, it was a good day. Good times were had by all and Beth got to see some wildlife she's never seen before, like dragonflies and a vulture (or was it a buzzard? I don't know the difference). I don't know how you can live for 26 years and never see a dragonfly, but that's Beth. Well, that's it for now. Maybe I'll update this thing again sometime. ",3690800.200407060.male.25.txt

1,"New friends Hi, I’m new here. I have a huge problem. It’s extremely hard for me to trust people I have a bond with (friends). Out of fear of rejection or disapproval for my actions, I don’t dare to become closer. I fear people will leave me eventually, so the idea that I have friends, isn’t present. When it is present, I feel like I need to stay in touch very often. I feel reluctant to take initiative often. If I don’t get asked for something, it’s a strong sign I’m not wanted. This has become standardized. I have some vague friends, but they live far away. We can’t that close, don’t share many interests, but we like each other. We can’t meet up often. What can I do to find new friends and do regularly something in my neighborhood. I’m close to a city, but I live in a village. I’m all day home (except for school and such), don’t feel energized to take action. Sigh. Getting advice like ‘find a sport, hobby, club’ doesn’t help much, I get suck. I feel like I don’t have even insight in the process of making friends. Or I’m not wanted. I feel like something is going wrong every time, but I don’t know what. Thanks in advance.

0,"We were all given about five minutes to decipher what the fuck this meant. Now, Mr. Runge had a reputation for being a tough teacher. He wouldn't let you get away with ANYTHING. If you fell asleep in his class because you were out all night in some cornfield with a bonfire and a bottle of Jack, he'd kick your desk in such a way that your head would fly upward at warp speed and your hangover would instantly get very very bad, and then suddenly disappear. Mr. Runge had some freaky special power that students couldn't tap into. I knew what the acronym stood for. But that's only because my high school boyfriend was a year ahead of me and gave me a heads up on how the first day with the Jolly Green Giant would play out. ""He's going to write this on the board, make you feel incredibly stupid and then it will be over."" TINSTAAFL, pronounced TinStaffel. There Is No Such Thing As A Free Lunch. Runge went on to explain that ""free"" didn't exist. The ""free"" lunches at college tours were paid for when your parents registered you were charged a ""service"" fee. Or, more on my level, Clinique never REALLY has a ""Free Gift with Purchase"". Because, you see...you have to make the purchase, dumb ass! And they over charge every other product just enough so that you're really paying for your ""free"" gift. This burst my bubble. Because now, whenever I take something marketed as free, I know I'm paying some sort of overhead or some poor schmuck is working extra hard so that I can get 2.5 ounces more of my favorite shampoo for the price of the regular size! You would think that I would have held on to this knowledge while looking for apartments. While scanning the ads, I bypassed the ones that used words like ""full of character"", because I knew that meant dump and ""TLC needed"", because I knew that meant dump. The one I honed in on boasted country living, quiet, serene, pond, lots o' land and everything included! I love where I live. I can't say it enough. If I didn't think raccoons would eat me at this hour, I'd jump on top of the roof and scream to the surrounding hills ""I love you and all your coniferous smells and the creatures you shelter!"" (Yeah, apparently the rooftop would make me a tad wordy.) My landlords are awesome people. Salt of the earth. Nice, down-home, trusting folk. And, as the contract for country people reads, ""Coon Hounds Must Be Owned and Bred"". I had never seen a breed of this type until I moved here. The momma dog was so sweet and gentle and quiet. She was quite the fatty too! Then suddenly she wasn't. And in her pen were ten little squeaky pups, eyes shut tight, blindly falling into food and water dishes, only to be rescued by momma. Cute, no? Who doesn't love puppies?? (If you bring Jackson up, I'll have to cut you.) It's been about month. Puppies have found their voices. All ten of them. And even the momma is begging for a release. Tigger is in the window, constantly doing a head count to make sure everyone is in their place and not a single one wanders off into oblivion. He's exhausted. Momma is exhausted because at night she performs a constant howl that cracks my heart. She's begging to be released from those needy fucking kids for at least ONE night of respite. And I'm exhausted. Because momma won't shut up and deal with her fate and every time a puppy so much as peeps, gaymancat is all over my head doing a get-up-because-they-might-run-into-traffic-and-get-hit-by-one-of-the-four-cars-that-pass-by-here-at-night dance.

0,"I don't particularly want to go into details about how I've been feeling the past couple of years, only because it's too much for me to go into, and I don't want to leave out important details or anything. In September 2005, I voluntarily admitted myself to the hospital's psych ward through my psychiatrist, the reason being because my depression had grown so severe that my muscles gave out and I couldn't move anymore, and my will to live had vanished entirely, I stopped eating, I was dehydrated, I stopped going to school, all I did was lay in bed all day, it's the only thing I could do. The decision to go to the hospital turned out to be a very, very big mistake, and I regret making that choice. I felt no connection with the other kids there, especially because I was a week away from turning eighteen, and most of them were thirteen, fourteen, and maybe one or two sixteen year olds. We were similar in an emotional aspect, but otherwise I couldn't relate to any of them. I just bored them, and the way they talked and the things they talked about just confused me. I did get involved with them to an extent during the last couple of days there, but I regret that now. This is a story in itself, but I also got involved with a girl there. She fell in love with me, and so did I fall in love with her, briefly. Only because a girl had never shown any attraction to me before, nor did a girl ever show any interest in me like she did. My feelings for her quickly faded after talking to her a couple of times outside the hospital. She turned out to be a real mess of a person. I did not suffer from the relationship, though. I do not talk to her anymore, and I actually became a better person because of it - I was enlightened. My depression practically disappeared following my discharge from the hospital. I don't know if it was because of the Zoloft that I had begun taking, or because I was finally free from that prison. By the way, I do have a form of claustrophobia. I am not particularly afraid of being in narrow or tight spaces... I am afraid of being locked in narrow or tight spaces. And the hospital was very small, and they did not let you leave or go where you wanted. You were confined to your room, the main recreation room, and the hallway connecting those two places. The day before I was discharged, I was constantly shaking, sweating, and going to the bathroom. I couldn't sleep, and I was afraid to move. I had to stay in my room most of the time and skip out on the group sessions. So anyway, even though I felt better right after getting out of the hospital, that quickly, VERY quickly changed. By mid-late October, I was on home-schooling (and will be until I graduate in June this year, I am a Senior in High School), and attending group therapy several days a week, as well as seeing a psychologist once a week and a psychiatrist every several weeks. All of this therapy did NOT help me. I was feeling extremely depressed and suicidal one night, after a brief fight with my dad (I accidentally bumped the curb while parking, he yelled at me to watch the curb, and I got very upset, pulled the parking break, and walked off while screaming about slitting my throat...), and called one of the therapists at my group therapy to help me. I'd locked myself in a room in my grandmother's basement, and I had called her so she could talk with me and help me to relax. Instead, she threatened to call the police if I didn't open the door and let my dad in. So I opened it, but after that I completely lost my trust in her and couldn't stand being around her anymore. Another counselor at the group therapy also lost my trust. I felt a connection with him, and trusted him a lot, so I told him about my girlfriend (whom I had met online - another story) and he kept on accusing me of things... like using her for sex, or not really being in love, and etcetera. So after having lost trust in two therapists, and then all sorts of insurance problems came up. I stopped going. A few weeks ago, I stopped going to my psychologist as well. I felt like I was being lectured by him instead of actually helped... On top of that, he was taking weekly co-pay from me while he knew my insurance did not require co-pay for anything psychological! (i.e. Counselors, psychologists, psychiatrists, etc.) And he still owes me a couple hundred bucks. He also charged my insurance for appointments I had cancelled. Basically, I took two steps forward, and then three steps back. My depression is not as bad as it was in September 2004, but I am pretty much tired of living. I am constantly thinking of suicide, and have even written brief suicide notes and made plans (which I never carried out). My Zoloft has been at 150mg for the past couple of months. It's helped my social anxiety slightly, but my depression - no. I am aware of the state that I am in, and I am simply tired of it. My future is all dark, I don't see things getting better. When I spoke with my girlfriend this weekend, I cried the entire night...  I just couldn't take everything anymore. I saw a new psychologist last week, but again, I feel like I'm being lectured. I am eighteen years old, and being talked to as if I were twelve. It's insulting and makes me feel even more left out of things than I already do. I don't know. ",mindslave_e_1_a_1_us.txt

I started them for anxiety mostly so I'm surprised that I'm relapsing so hard into depression. I just wish I didn't exist-- eh, better yet I wish I didn't have to participate in every day life. I don't know what to do. I used to have so much motivation to finish my college work and now I have none. I have finals that start tomorrow that I haven't studied for at all. Like, not even a little. And somehow I don't care. That's just not like me. I'm exhausted from putting so much effort in all the time. I exhausted from being stressed all the time. I don't want to keep doing this. I just want to sleep. And to think I have four more years ahead of me. I don't know what I'm going to do. I already feel like a failure. I keep thinking that maybe I could find something to take my mind off things but I have no hobbies. I don't enjoy anything any more. Not even eating, which I used to love probably too much but hey. I want to lie in my floor and watch the days pass by me. I don't want to have to keep trying. Another thing is everything and everyone irritates the living hell out of me now. The smallest thing sends me over the edge into my spiral. Three weeks ago if I spilled my coffee I would have laughed it off. It happened the other day and I cried for hours and was so angry. Three weeks ago I was better than this. And I'm crashing all of a sudden. I don't know how I'm going to study for my finals and maintain my GPA to keep my scholarships. I'm fucked probably. My therapist is not that great and I haven't seen her in awhile and I don't have money to go back to her. My psych appointment isn't until late January, after my medical procedure. I just want to be happy and have some motivation for fucks sake. ",marinacatherine.txt

I was suprised to find out we had quite a bit in common and I felt so giddy every time I talked to her.

I don't know what I was expecting but she read it the note and walked away with the gift. She texted me a few minutes later she was nervous to reject me because she knew I was afraid and she would like to stay friends. I can't blame her for how she feels, it's her choice. Although, I feel utterly defeated. I have never been on a date or been kissed, or in any relationship with someone. I thought maybe this would be it, but I was wrong.

0,"Hey, I guess this is the place to post this. I don't really know if I'm depressed and if I am I'm not sure how to go about getting help for it so I figured you guys would be able to help me out a bit. For the past year and a bit I've been feeling really out of sorts, pretty down and kind of lost in general. I left school in July 2004 and started a year out before I went to university. That's when I started feeling strange and I put it down to (and still believe it was) just a weird kind of feeling when one leaves school and their life changes forever and it's the beginning of being an adult which is a scary time for anyone. Over the year I'd go through different stages where for a few months I'd feel really positive and enjoy spending time with people and then for a few months I'd feel lonely and sad and not go out with friends for months on end. Then I went to university in September 2005 and felt very very sad. I think it was the shock of leaving home, living away from everyone I'd ever known and also the feeling of being back at school. I knew immediately that I'd made a terrible decision starting university, it wasn't what I wanted to be doing with my life and for the 6 weeks I was there I would stay in bed pretty much all day and not eat much. I think I lost about a stone and a half and even now, 3 months after dropping out and moving back home I'm still half a stone lighter than I was last summer. So now I'm back at home and I've started a job cleaning tables in a cafe where I got on with the people I work with and I'm back in the same city as my girlfriend again and things should be ok but I keep dropping into really low moods.  A few weeks ago I thought that maybe it was depression and so I took some tests on the internet with what seem to be the basic questions. I tried to answer as truthfully as possible, you have to understand that depression is not something I want to have, I've known too many silly teenagers who think that having depression makes them interesting to other people and so they exaggerate emotions to try and look sad to find it appealing. So even though I found myself answering questions that I knew were making me seem depressed I answered the anyway because it was the truth. Things like a lowered libido, I find myself wanting to have sex with my girlfriend far far less frequently than I used to and to be honest a lot of the time when I'm having sex I feel that I'm just going through the motions. My sleeping which has always been a little odd has become increasingly erratic and I've found myself thinking about death a lot. To be honest though I thought that everyone thought about death and dying and that it was natural. I fin myself becoming very easily bored with people and situations and where I once used to enjoy writing stories I can't being myself to do it anymore. The worst thing though is the mood swings I have and the low moods I find myself in quite frequently. When I feel like this I don't want to be around anyone or have anyone talk to me and I can't stop myself thinking about bad things that have happened to me or could happen on a personal level and making myself the centre of blame for them. So am I depressed or is it just, as I'm leaning towards, a natural part of growing up and finding myself in the world of work and adulthood and trying to adjust to it. And if I am depressed how do I stop myself being this way? The thought of going to my doctor and sitting there and saying ""I think I'm depressed"" doesn't make much sense to me. I've always thought that with problems of that nature you must be told that you're ill and not decide for yourself that you are. Sorry if this has been very long and poorly punctuated, I wrote it all fairly stream of consciously. Any help at all would be very much appreciated, I'm feeling pretty vulnerable and down right now and don't want to feel this way anymore. ",chalieburd_e_1_a_1_xx.txt

And it just seems so much better than being alive. When you’re alive, you feel so much. Yes, there’s happiness, excitement, surprise, love. But there’s also sadness, anger, hate, jealousy. Why would I chose to bare such things when death can provide none of these things? All the “good stuff” about living doesn’t weigh out the bad, in my head.

0,"Has your family always ignored your problem? I think the hardest part of being depressed since I was a kid is how absolutely ignored I was/am by my family. My parents split up when I was 5 and my father died when I was 10. My family completely sweeped it under the rug like I was supposed to be completely ok with it and it has never been a topic of discussion at home. I walked around sad, slumbered over, quiet, avoided eye contact and stared into the distance for years and years and no one ever assumed proper to ask if there is something wrong with me. The only time they sent a psychologist my way was when they had to determine who I should live with after divorce. My mother to this day seems absolutely oblivious to my suffering. I don't ever feel like telling them for they will propably assume I'm ungrateful and spoilt. I've had everything! They sent me to school, fed me, put clothes on my back.

While we aim to facilitate a fun and welcoming place for online strangers to meet and make friends, our core philosophy rests on the concept of free and open discussion. This means the staff takes a hands-off approach in regards to the opinions of the users and the language used. At the end of the day, The Glory Hole is all about hilarity and friendship, nevertheless, if you are easily offended, this probably isn’t the place for you. **What’s with the Theme?** Our server’s theme is a fun piece of window dressing that allows a colourful hierarchy of roles for users to work towards via their activity in the server. We may be a hole in the wall, but we are a classy one at that :p **General Life?** The server consists of text, media, and voice channels where users share their interests, pets, favourite videos, etc, and have discussions of all varieties. Most of the action happens in the voice channels however, where we have rooms for watching movies, listening to music, and playing video games in addition to large rooms for rowdy discussions and smaller rooms for more quiet conversations. Sometimes we’re all in a big room together, chilling out as we play video games, and other times we splinter off into separate rooms to partake in differing activities. Once a week however we host a planned movie event where users make suggestions, cast votes, and hold screenings of their favourite films. We would like to partake in more regular planned events as the server grows. **Bots!** Our main bot, Madam Luvaeux, incorporates a silly currency system so that you can gamble, purchase other users, and even buy colourful roles to lord over other users. Many other bots are also available that allow users to listen to music, play games, post memes, and other various time-wasting activities. **Should I Join?** We have a great group of friends already, but we are always open to welcome newcomers into our fold. A group of people like The Glory Hole is an amazing way to make new friends and to fill those lonely evenings up with lots of laughter and other voices.

0,"The Irony of Loneliness in an Overpopulated World As I spend more time in the presence of depression, I've tried to apply a further focus to understand what's actually going on in my head. Dealing with the sudden appearance of depression has been a nightmare and a half to deal with to say the least. So in response, I regularly attempt to interpret the spiral of self loathing thoughts and whirlwind of emotions that march throughout my mind. My initial reaction to a diagnosis of major depression and multiple failed suicide attempts has been to run away from everything that reeks of painful memories, both theoretically and literally: * I write this post 7,000 kilometres from my home country, in Japan, where I aim to live for the next couple of years. * ‎I've ghosted those whom I use to call my close friends. * I left all social media in order to avoid contacting people that I knew, and because looking at how happy other people were brought me down. * ‎I changed my image drastically over the past year as an outward expression of the fact that I'm trying to change as a person. It's here in Japan that I've come to a terrifying realisation. I can't run from depression. Here I am, in a country where people speak a totally different language and immersed in a totally different culture to my own, writing a post about depression. Recently, I was walking the streets in search for job opportunities when I sunk into a depressed mood and began thinking about my place in the world (which always turns out well). Nothing actually matters. We work in order to pay rent, in order to stay in the same place, so that we can reliably keep a job so that we can pay rent. It's in this meaninglessness that humans as social beings look to others for comfort. Our lives are but a meaningless speck in an expanding universe. That's quite the depressing thought... And it is. But why is it that when another body's lying on top of mine, or when I'm held in a warm embrace, this thought doesn't have any impact on me? I've done quite a bit of thinking by myself,  and have talked to a bunch of people from back in the psychiatric ward on what 'fixes' us. And the unfortunate answer for most of us is... Nothing. We can't be fixed. It's just how our minds work. But what if we don't have to be fixed? The hardest part about depression for me, is the intensity of the loneliness I feel. When I'm at my worst, I'm so focused on my own loneliness and the meaninglessness of my relationships, that the few connections I do have, I dismiss. Now, this isn't the case for all people suffering from depression. For a lot of people, their negative emotions are driven by a sense of worthlessness,  meaninglessness or sadness. But the general consensus is, although we can't 'fix' ourselves, we can have people around us to support us when we're at our lowest. And it makes sense that as social beings, human intimacy provides us with a safety net for when depression's hitting us the hardest. Unfortunately for most of us, the type of physical and emotional intimacy that we strive for is unobtainable. In my life, depression's caused me to push away the people that I've spent time building connections with, and has limited the amount of contact I've had with strangers and people that I COULD connect with. I think it's ironic. It's ironic that in such an overpopulated world, depression is such a big issue. We're the people that need intimacy the most, so you'd think we'd be in a position where intimacy is more readily available. But that's not how the world works. Our lives are still meaningless. We still hate ourselves. And we're still alone. ",SKMojo99.txt

1,"Okay, so I just spent $50.00 bucks on a optical mouse.  It was either that or spend the money on food or shoes.

There were reports of people actually being so appalled at this film to go as far as slashing the screen in anger.  And it's easy to see why, to put it bluntly, I love Michael Moore.  In short, it's about the bush adminidstration and such follies and gags.  Mr. Moore goes into the very bowels of the bush admniistration(too big of a word for this late at night) and brings up all the dirty secrets that they have been hiding in the past four years.  It goes from the election, to the patriot act all the way through the war in Iraq.  Not only that, but he got to poke fun at bush the entire time.  Its good wholesome family fun.  Actually I shouldn't say that, there are in fact a lot of very graphic scenes that were incredibly hard to watch.  A lot of things that made me incredibly angry that this could ever happen.

He was one of those people who were better off just in jail so they can’t do harm to themselves, others, and the community. I cringed every time I saw him around. I couldn’t understand for the life of me why people put up with his shit and enable him. The same people who put up with him were the same ones who would complain and complain about him. My mom didn’t want my younger siblings around him.. we wouldn’t put it past him to do stuff to kids. I was so sick of hearing what Kenny did or tried to do. I feel absolutely horrible for my great grandfather who is 85 and is ALWAYS the one to clean up his mess. I feel bad for my great grandfather in the sense he has to burry his son and once again, clean up the mess that he has left. I may be the only person to not see this as a “loss”. No one has to sit around and worry, watch their things, wait around for a phone call that he’s either dead or in jail again. All of the bullshit just stops. ",Help_Me_Reddit01.txt
0,"girl So in the past 2-3 months i been talking to this one girl. I love everything about her and we really clicked together, seeing as we're both socially retarded. Literally everything's been looking up, i started working out, being generally happier and more carefree even in social environments. I'm not exactly depressed, just don't really feel much emotion and I don't relate to people around me. Never been a fan of going out and I've had major problems getting to know anyone (I only have 1 very close friend, besides her). I've always had the feeling that I'm tolerated but not wanted whenever I'm around others, but this chick changed that completely. I actually started to look forward to waking up in the morning and meeting her at uni. On a side note we also like pretty much the same things - similiar music taste, similiar views, similiar feeling of being a reject and ofc vidya games, books and other shit. I knew I was steadily falling in love with her (something I honestly thought impossible before) and just recently I found out she's got a boyfriend. I proceeded to spend the next 2 hours crying like a little bitch for the first time in over a decade. After that I couldn't even hit any fucking awp shots in cs cause I still had tears streaming from my eyes. My question is, have I reached the point of being pathetic enough that I should call it quits and neck myself? ",sup9rsymmetry.txt
1,"Should I meet estranged grandfather? I've never met my  grandfather due to him and my grandmother being divorced, and my mother being the ""least favorite"" wants nothing to do with him. However her siblings are super close to him and my cousins have known him their whole lives. I'm not aware of any physical abuse that happened but I know verbal towards my mother and grandmother and their appearances and capabilities occurred as well as blaming my mother for the divorce. He has attempted to apologize to my mother for years and sends her cards which she throws away or returns. If physical occurred I would not want to meet him and I'm wondering if my mother is acting the way she is because she's hiding something. Also he has never reached out to me but my aunts say he asks about me regularly. He may have not reached out due to the fact my mother won't speak to him. But part of me doesn't want to care if he's not willing to reach out. I'm torn.... Any advice? ",hummingbird423.txt

1,"I can't forgive her, no matter how hard I try I'm focusing on improving myself and working through repressed emotions from a difficult upbringing, namely with my grandmother. I am currently staying with her but thankfully I am already making plans and taking steps to move out within the next 5 months or so. I have stayed on and off the last several years and before I became an adult, I lived with her from birth. We have a complicated relationship. Although I appreciate the things she has done for me - and she often tries to make me happy by buying me something or getting me food I like, etc. - I can't seem to let go of the deep seated anger and resentment I feel toward her for the mistakes she has made and how she has also been cruel to me. I understand no one is perfect; adults aren't always ideal role models to kids. But my grandmother had a unique way of mentally and emotionally hurting me as a child. She would often act like I was her partner in crime [in the absence of a husband] and made me feel responsible for her happiness. She would try to talk bad about my mom so I wouldn't favor her [my mom wasn't living with us and had mental issues]. She would give me the cold shoulder, or say things to incite anxiety and guilt in me if I happened to act like I wanted to spend more time with my mom or got in a bad mood. It confuses me because I think deep in my heart I DO want a happy relationship with her...or maybe I try so hard out of guilt, knowing she has tried to make it up to me, I guess? But every so often I implode and I tell her how much she bothers me or even that I hate her. Sometimes even hearing the sound of her voice is enough to make me want to scream in irritation. I feel terrible about it and like I'm a monster. I always feel guilty when she tells me 'you're the only one who is really special to me, you're the only one I have.' [She doesn't have a close relationship with mom, her other D, or siblings.] Maybe I get angry because to me, this doesn't feel normal, it feels like I'm being trapped. I'm seeing a DBT therapist but we aren't making progress about this ... yet. I just wish this was not my life. I'm not looking for solutions per say, just sympathy or someone who also understands. It's so exhausting. ",tsundokuprincess.txt
1,"Im Tessa. Im 16 years old. My little boy Ian is now 11 1/2 months. Everyday I look at him and am just amazed by how big he's getting. my life has changed so much since I had him. I mean who could believe that just over 2 years ago I was on my way to being in the ""popular crowd"". I was Miss Suzy High School. I hated it and I hated me. Prentending that I loved cheer. Don't get me wrong cheer is great just not for me. I don't have the patcience or the determination to give up that much time to one lousy sport.   I hated pretending that I loved hanging out with my boyfriend. I gave up all my friends for him. I loved him but I definitly missed my friends. Critter was so controlling. Always telling me who, what, where, and when. He let all his friends just walk all over me.    But that's changed. I got pregnant at the young age of 14. Critter didn't want to believe it. I was making it up supposedly to get him not to break up with me. Ya right! I loved him but I'm not that pathetic. I was too scared to tell my parents. So I waited until I was 5 1/2 months along. Too far along to keep hiding it. I don't think I've ever seen my parents so mad. They were convinced that I couldn't handle a baby so I'd give him up to my parents. My mom can't have any more children and she's always wanted another. But i knew differant, I knew i could handle a baby. I fought over every little thing with them. I was so stupid about the true rights for teen parents. I believe my parents when they said that I had to do with that baby what they wanted me to. So I let them talk me into giving Ian my stepdad's last name. Ian Matthew Kubitza. Everyday since they talked me into it I've regreted it more than you can imagine.    One thing that I was right about was that I could handle a baby. I'm the one who deals with temper tantrums, dirty diapers and late nights.  Don't get me wrong, without my mom I never could have made it this far. My mom watches Ian when I go to school and when I work. I still go to school full time and I'm going to start nursing next year through a program in my HS. I can't wait. I also have a part time job now. Granted it isn't the best but hey it's something!

My girlfriend and I just had a very important discussion two weeks ago about getting married. She then left to go on vacation for two weeks with her family. Since she leff, I keep thinking that she will say she doesn't love me and doesn't want to marry me. I've told her I love her and that I want to marry her but haven't yet proposed.      She is the type that likes to know all about what's going to happen before it happens. So she asked me all about the future and what I think about when we should get married and what will happen after that. I told her I want to marry her in December. She objects because she is a school teacher (like me)and that is a busy time of year. I'm okay with doing it another time (like June) but I love her so much and want to begin my life with her right now.      Anyway, I'm ultimately worried that she will get scared and run away.

1,"My family might break apart... Sorry this is a long post. Yes I know this is common thing sadly. But I don’t want it to, 12 years my family have been together. Just to start off, There is me, my brother, my dad and mum. So my dad has anger issues. His parents never told him it was wrong so he has been like this all his life. Our mum is his second wife because his first wife divorced him for all the reasons I’m about to mention. We only listen to him because he rules out of fear, he isn’t teaching us anything, and is a bad influence on us. When he gets annoyed he yells really loudly on purpose for everyone to hear (including our neighbours) then drives off for an hour. He’s always threatening to me and my brother, “I’LL KICK YOU IN THE FACE”, “YOU’LL END UP IN HOSPITAL.” I’ve despised him for about 3 weeks and it’s actually a lot better when he drives off and vanishes. Problem is, he makes 80% of our money. My brother is slowly becoming like my dad.I’m trying to help him, my mum is trying to help him but it isn’t working. I believe he can still change because he’s still young (12). He yells at our parents trying to prove he is right all the time. Problem is, he won’t listen to us unless our dad threatens him and scares him into stopping. Heres the big problem, he is a messy person and our mum is a very tidy person, she tells him all the time clean up but he says, “I’ll do it later”, but never actually does it. So my mum and brother argue often about this. He says he doesn’t care about who he is becoming, but I know he does. Despite all the tension between me and my brother I still love him very much. My mum is the only reason our family is still together. She ends up stopping dad from slapping/threatening us and is the one that teaches me and my brother right from wrong. She’s basically carrying our whole family and I feel bad about it. I love her very much and I feel so much empathy for her. She was a good daughter and this is the life she grew up for. It’s sad, really. And me, I was also becoming like my dad, but ever since Mid 2017 I’ve had a fear of me or my brother becoming like him in the future. I’m using my words, I’m trying not to yell. I’m trying not to walk off after every arguement so I can tame my temper. I’ve slipped a few times, but this fear is actually changing me for the better. I’m telling my brother not to answer back to our parents but he won’t listen. I’m trying to help my mum because I feel sorry for her. So recently, it’s me and my mum trying to stop my brother from yelling at us, stopping our dad threating/slapping us. I’m trying to get my brother to see the future like me. So just yesterday, my brother made a light-hearted joke to my dad and he got mad and slapped him. Later that evening, our mum asked him why he did that. So he drove off and came back at 1am. After this, our mum and dad haven’t spoken to each other. This morning my brother keeps arguing his point to our mum, I try to support her. My dad has done nothing. All he did was wake up, drove off and come back at 7:30pm to sleep, then he drove off again. So just a few hours ago, my mum tells my brother to clean up. This causes a arguement. I support mum, but my brother won’t stop yelling. I told him to stop 3 times but he told me, “You don’t have the authority to tel me to do anything”.  After this my mum asks me, “what should we do now?” Then I messaged my brother and things have been solved between us. Thats too much arguements for just 2 days, don’t you think? And my mum is right, what can we do? There’s too much problems with all of us, and we’re all depending on each other so it’s not easy. My mum would’ve divorced dad long ago if she had the money. I want me, my brother and mum to live together peacefully away from the bad influence of our dad. We haven’t called the authorities because my mum is afraid of what will happen to our dad. We haven’t got outside help because our parents think it’s embarassing. So, what choices do we have? ",Greenjets.txt

I bought some of my favorite snacks and got my old blanket, just going to watch some of my favorite movies today. I also bought a card for myself ( which i do every year) , written on it was ""Happy Birthday, Love mum and dad""... they were the last people to ever tell that to me and i know that even tho its been over a decade since they're gone, they were the last people to celebrate and be happy because of me, the last people to love me. i miss them so much. I get so lonely, its hard to cope sometimes, i wish i could spend more time with them. I love you mum and dad :) EDIT 1: Thank you all so much for the wishes, it really means a lot. this is the most i've gotten in years. Really made my day, been struggling to cope especially in the last few months, everything is just hitting like a train so thank you to all! Wish you all a good day :) EDIT 2: THANK YOU SO MUCH TO EVERYONE! You are all such awesome people. I cannot express how thankful i am and how this has been my best birthday in years, i feel like a kid again. i have not smiled more in the past years. It brings tears to my eyes to receive so many thoughtful messages and support, all of you are just great! Hearts of gold. Thank you. Thank you. And to everyone in this subreddit I've finally found my bit of happiness, all thanks to you! I no longer feel alone, and you shouldn't either! Theres so many good people here on reddit. Hope you all are coping and hope you have a great day! ",indict_me.txt
0,I have gone days without talking to anyone I just got out of a bad relationship recently. But I have a issue with dependancy. I let him dictate my entire life. I let him into my head to the point I feel brainwashed. I hate everyone. I don't trust anyone. I don't want to talk to anyone because I know he will get mad and be jealous. He is the closest and only person I have in my life and even though we broke up he wants us to remain best friends. We dated for 2 years and it was Rocky the entire time. But I let him get his hooks into me and I can't get out. I am terrified to not have him in my life because then I will be truly alone. I don't talk to anyone else. I am 26 years old and I have 0 friends other then him. I am terrified of being alone. But he is seeing someone else now. She is 100 times better then me in every way. She is super model gorgeous and everything that me and him shared she has as well. I feel replaced. But I don't want to not be his friend and not have him in my life. I'm terrified to lose him. I cling to the hope one day he will want me again. I haven't talked to another person in over a week. and if he is busy with her I don't talk to anyone at all. I just lay on my couch staring at the wall and having a constant never ending panic attack. I have sever depression and severe anxiety that I take medicine for both. But they only make the feelings bearable and don't take them away completely. I don't sleep. I just want to throw myself at every fuck boy on dating apps just to have some kind of physical attention even if it is only sex. Even if I am not attracted to them. I don't care. I just want someone to love me. I want someone to hold me and make me feel not alone. I don't know what to do. I feel like I've been kicked in the chest. It hurts to breathe. I made a noose and stood on a stool with it around my neck for over a hour the other night crying. But I couldn't do it. I don't know how to go on living. ,LillithMoonx.txt

My life is so controlled and he doesn't even see it. He denies it when i bring it up. I cry because i can't buy things for my children or grandchildren. This isn't the way it is suppose to be. One of the reasons I don't make it to church on some Sundays is because I don't have clothes to wear. I have a pair of black jeans i keep switching jackets and shirts so i don't look the same every Sunday. My daughter bought me a nice dress and it was warm enough last Sunday to wear it. I guess i shouldn't care about what people think and all the people at my church are wonderful, not judgmental. I do go to the Lord in Prayer every morning and study my Bible. I feel content because we are supposed to give all our worries to him and not get in his way of taking care of them. I know God is working in my life, my daughter finding this site is just one of the ways i know. my husband just got a job after being out of work for a year. I prayed for that too. He didn't just get a job but he got a good job. I told him he didn't get it on his own. I know I am going to get better eventually. Thank all of you for being here for me.

0,"This sub is useless I don't want to appear pessimistic or a negative person, but I do really believe this sub is useless. This is the usual happening on this sub, op posts ""i feel like shit because I have no friends""/ ""life sucks"" /""I want to feel normal"" and other redditors reply with ""yeah same"" /""i understand""/""I feel like shit too"". I mean, what kind of reaction one expects from posts like this? I realize that op doesn't really want advices, he just wants to vent and I admit I've done the same, but honestly, did I feel better? Did I feel better after I realized other people are suffering with me? No. Maybe if I told a friend, to my brother that I'm feeling like shit, maybe, I would feel better,but to unknown people on the internet? What they tell me is worthless. I don't need to feel comforted or understood, I need help from people and receiving advices on how I can improve my life or stories of people feeling better. Something which is really lacking on this sub. I want to feel better and I don't care about intellectualizing my pain or feel comforted. If one day I feel I have no hope and no chance of feeling better I will kill myself. Today sucks, but tomorrow might not, so let's just try doing tangible efforts. Thanks for reading.

1,"This is my first attempt at keeping any sort of journal. I have never been very good at keeping any sort of record of my life. I have always had the fear that once an experience is put on paper, the brain no longer has a need to remember it and the memory is thus discarded, or rerouted for use in another way. Therefore, I am rather skeptical to put much of note down here too soon. Perhaps my mind ramblings will be just that, ramblings, nothing more, nothing less. Or, perhaps, I will learn that the more I jot down, the more I will be able to remember. The brain never ceases to amaze me. It remembers things long since forgotten, in a way...Perhaps that is where DeJaVue comes from. I am constantly in a state of rememberance, that is the way that I know I am on the right track in life. Whenever I don't get a memory of something that I am doing that I know I have never done before, I know that what I am doing is that which I am supossed to be doing. My life, otherwise, might get very complicated and then where would I be?  A friend from my childhood has had a very trying life and started blogging to sort things out. I am very proud of her for that. She is who made me decide to try it. I don't really have an outlet for my life, my husband has a hard time understanding my need for higher and higher education. That is not to say that he is not supportive or encouraging by any means, it is just that he felt a Bachelors degree was all that was really needed. I, on the other hand, feel that I need to get more. I am in the process of completing my BA in Molecular Biology and a minor in Chemistry, only to persue a DVM/PhD combo in the next 6yrs.  Perhaps I will obtain that goal, but for now I am just looking forward to finally obtaining my first degree...and it has only me since 1996...3 years sabatical for work and my son...etc, basically life in general...

1,"Obesity Is Killing Our Friendship Context - I'm 21 F, my friend is 24 F.  Both students living alone. Obesity related health issues don't just run in her family - they've killed almost half her relatives. Six years ago, she ate fine, sure she was ""curvy"" but that was her build, her nature. She went on walks with her friends. Now she can barely make it to her front door. Her cousin - in his teens - died recently from heart failure. Weight related. Yet, she continues to put on weight, eat awful food - like taking home meat double burgers from mc donalds and then re-frying them at home, for breakfast, plus sweets, every day - and also taking energy drinks all day followed by sleeping pills at night. That is, physically, killing her according to her doctors, but there's where our issues as friends start. What's killing out friendship is her desperation - but absolute lack of effort - when it comes to loosing weight. She talks about switching back to eating the things that, when we first met, she loved - banana breakfast smoothies and chicken schnitzel. She even did a Go Fund Me for a stomach reduction surgery. Has seen more nutritionists than I knew existed. Yet whatever happens, she only eats more, or worse. She was told to stop eating pringles, and replace them with a healthy alternative like corn wafers but instead, she swapped them for deep fried pork buns. And so on. Friends have always offered to help, to buddy up, to go with. I've been on diets she ditched the first day. I've been to the gym only to have her ""go bathroom"" out the front door. Everyone else gave up. It doesn't help that her family, Fijian-Indians, seem to see food as the only way to show love. The early years, when she actually tried to diet, they'd constantly bring her fatty treats because they thought she looked too skinny. And of course, she'd eat them. And they'd bring more. I have seen her go through almost four years of pretending she'll try. I've gotten so excited and so happy and so hopeful only to have it thrown in my face. I love her, but in all honesty, I don't want to keep waiting and watching for her to die. Because that's what the diagnosis has been for the past 6 months - change her life, or die from complications. But all she does is whine about being fat, and then ask me to order in pizza. What would you do?  I don't want to continue to watch her kill herself, but I can't think of anything I can possibly do to help her change. ",bloggingbitface.txt

1,"Which I already knew, of course, but I am feeling pretty sorry for myself. Three and a half weeks ago I tore ligaments in my left knee, effectively curtailing most fun for the next several months. PMO!!! Anyway - the good news is that the bruising has now faded, the swelling is down, I can walk further than I could even a couple days ago. The bad news is that I am still wearing this silly brace and using a cane. The physiotherapist said I ""did a real number"" on my LCL and illotibial band (sp?) and can expect the healing process to take a while. It could have been worse right? I could have broken my leg or completely torn the LCL. It could have been my right leg and I wouldn't be able to drive.   So much for paddling this summer. At this point I still can't bend my knee far enough to get or out of a boat. I CAN still do weights though and I had a short somewhat successful trial on my indoor bike a couple days ago. I walked around the bloack today too - not exactly the 10km run I wished I was doing, but a few days ago I could only make it halfway around and today the whole loop was easy. Progress, progress.

1,"Hello. I'm so glad you've come. Would you like a cup of tea? I like mine with two heaped spoons of sugar and full-cream milk. But you can have yours any way you like. I'm not going to stop you.   Well, I might as well introduce myself, since you've made it this far. And you look like you're comfortable so I've got nothing to lose.    My name is Mrs Walker and I am 26 years old. I live in a pink square house on Harlem Avenue, in a working class neighborhood ten miles west of the Chicago loop. My husband, Mr. Walker, and I, bought the house in April and we moved in on May 1.   Our house is different from other houses. From Harlem Avenue, our house looks just like a pink square lego brick that's come alive and has grown eyes and a mouth. In front of the house is a strawberry field and there are five fruit trees on our double lot. We have grape vines growing over the deck and peonies, roses and other exotic looking flowers exploding all over our Chicago plot. On the other half of the lot (it's a double) are neat blocks of soil divided by wooden walkways. We have planted corn, brocolli, carrots, beans, tomatoes, peppers and herbs here. Every day my husband and I look on in astonishment as the plants rise up out of the ground in their mission to feed us.   When we first looked at the house in March this year, we had no idea what was already in the ground. The stawberry plants, berries and grapevines have all burst forth since we moved in. In the last two weeks we have picked perhaps half a dozen pounds of strawberries. We've given away baskets to friends and I took a couple quarts into the office one day. We've made strawberry jam and I tried strawberry fudge but I didn't wait for the mixture to get hot enough and it didn't set. I threw the whole pan of fudge out and only had to feel guilty about the dollar or so that I spent on the can of evaporated milk, and the three cups of sugar.   Well, that is not exactly true. I was sorely devastated by my failed fudge attempt and I bought new ingredients at the grocery store today. In fact I'm going to attempt a new batch again right now. If it turns out alright this time, I'll share the recipe with you.   So please come back to visit. Next time I may even have a chocolate biscuit for you to eat with your tea.

I really felt like maybe I was on the wrong line of thought to get over the depression. Yet I did feel better. I thought my life isn't changing though. I have so many hopes and dreams for my life and here I am sitting around wasting it. I still feel like that at times but then something bad happened and I didn't react to it. I didn't feel worse. Then someone did something stupid and I didn't yell at them. I went to a friend and asked if she thought I was getting better. Her answer was. Hell Yeah. You bother to talk to me now. It seems she was doing all the talking at one stage. I didn't know. It's been 10 years since I first got depressed In all the tests on the computer it went from severe depression to moderate the other day I got mild depression. Ok today its back to moderate.

I'm kicking myself for it for being incompetent and those words from that woman came back you have all this knowledge you should be better.

I've gone through therapy before, stopped for a while, and am now trying to find a new therapist that takes my insurance. Every day is almost total isolation. I go to class. I fantasize about working up the courage to talk to someone or say something in class but never do. I go back to my apartment. My randomly assigned roommates, all several years younger than me, keep to themselves. I am too afraid to talk to them. So I hole up in my small room and play video games or do homework. Day in. Day out. Rinse. Repeat. This has been my life for several years now. I'm incredibly insecure. I have some combination of body dysmorphia and an eating disorder. I'm probably quite good looking but I've never been in a relationship; I'm still a kissless virgin. This eats me alive and makes me afraid to talk to women. Another reason to isolate further. I'm losing touch with reality. I have loving parents but their advice isn't particularly helpful. What I want is a friend, someone to talk to--but the anxiety gets in the way. I can talk to people in a structured setting, like therapy, or online (and easily and freely at that). But it's the act of doing it in the real world, in a natural setting, that is just impossible.

This solidified into a type of gel, not very stable ( a bit like me) but lethally flammable and sticky.  But a revised method is to pour some gasoline into an old container and force it to eat up styrofoam-you can even use the little white balls from the inside of a bean bag- untill it wont take anymore, this dries into a form of foam itself, with a wet slice at the bottom, tie some into a soggy ball and wrap with cling film to seal it and you have a perfect pocket rocket for throwing into a car window or something else that wants to burn, you could even hook up a basic fuse into it and run away, very fast indeed, because if you have tied the cling film on tightly enough it will just explode big time, superb.

1,"Why is it so difficult to preserve wealth within a family for longer than one hundred years? Some family members can make fortune during their lifetime. Because they were lucky, or because they worked hard, or smart. It doesn’t matter. It is almost inevitable that after two generations passing the lucky one the third generation returns to the poverty with very poor financial background. There are always and always will be more failures than successful stories. Why is it happening? Because of mismanagement. There are no other reasons! Not because they are too old, too young, too tall, or too stupid… But, because they failed to create a system which can monitor, rule, manage, predict future successes and failures. Most families have no idea that such systems have been existing and successfully helping some families to do this job efficiently. Do those families share this knowledge with humanity? No way. Why would they do that? They literally rule the world, they have all the power and all the money. I’m fortunate to collaborate with some of those families. What if I ask you: Would it be interesting for you to uncover their secrets and to know how they do it? Would it be interesting for you to see a blueprint of their success? Many families are struggling in our society. They have no idea where they are going to and what goals they have. It leads to frustration, procrastination, apathy and depression. Because they have been caught in a daily routine. Day after day, month after month… No time to think, no time to plan, no time to review or set goals. In my opinion, this is the reality for 99,99% of the human population of the Earth. Is there a solution? Yes! But, you have to implement some strategies.

1,"car shopping today went well. i'm really looking at two cars, the nissan spectra and the a saturn coupe. both have the basics that i want, sporty look, power everything, sunroof, standard transmission etc. the spectra has got more balls than the saturn but i think i'll get a better deal with the saturn. this is my first experiance buying a NEW car. soo many choices, i feel like a kid in a candy store..hehe  still no real resolution on the female issue. seems as though it get more complicated whichever way i go, so i think my plan is going to be to just ride out the storm and hope for a better days in the future. i know i know not a very creative solution but i honestly can't think of anything else.  on a different note i was thinking about the relationship my generation has with their work. my parents worked three jobs when they were younger and to this day i haven't know them to complain about it. they saw it as a chance to make money and as simply doing what you needed to do. it's strange that just one generation later we see people who can barely handle working one fulltime job and endlessly complain about how much they do. i really believe if we worked harder as a generation we would not only do better personally but do more for each other. not to get too religious but catholics believe that forgiveness/redemption is not based on faith alone but also on good deeds. maybe if we did more for each other on a regular basis we would all be better off, then again that's just my opinion...

0,"Is it better to find out your love was a lie, or never to have loved at all? Last year, after 16 years of marriage, my wife says she never loved me, has never found me attractive (who can blame her), and doesn't think we've ever been right for each other. She only married me because she felt pressured from family and church to get married, and I was a ""good guy"", as she puts it. This crushed me. She has been everything to me. I have always loved her so much. My whole marriage has always been a fairy tale for me, it was everything I wanted. This was the girl of my dreams. I remember thinking when we were dating that it was too good to be true that any girl, especially one as amazing as my wife, would ever like me, since I'm shy, boring, and ugly. I guess I was right, it was too good to be true, and I should have trusted my gut and known it back then. After a year of trying to find ways to connect with her, make myself more attractive to her, and hoping she'd love me, I've finally accepted that she never will. We are staying together for the kid's sake, and really for mine, what else would I do, no one else could ever love me, and I doubt I could ever really love anyone else the way I loved my wife. I've accepted that I will never have love. It makes me wonder, is it better to have thought I had love, and enjoyed it, only to find out it was lie, or never to have loved at all. At this point I really don't know. ",whiteranger_2000.txt

0,"Aha! moment during therapy So I've been meeting with a therapist about once a week since October of 2017. It's been really great, and has helped pull me from the brink more than once. Background: I'm gay, and was raised Catholic in the 90s. Guess what happened next! Spoiler: I was bullied mercilessly. If I wasn't too gay, I was too fat, or too tall, or too weird or too unpopular. You get the gist. It it wasn't my hair, it was my mannerisms; if it wasn't my high voice, it was the dark circles under my eyes. (Gee, what could have caused me to be losing sleep?) Flash forward to today: My therapist guided me through a meditation today that instructed me to visualize and speak to a younger version of myself. I described what I looked like, what characteristics defined me, and how I saw myself. Then I was instructed to, as myself as the adult I've become, speak to that child and tell him what I was feeling. I spoke with kindness and compassion and love and respect for that child, and told him everything would be alright. I told him that all of that hatred was wrong, that it was incorrect and that those people who say all those nasty hurtful things, they probably aren't even going to remember saying it, so don't waste your time holding onto it. And it got me thinking about all of the baggage I've he'd onto my life. All the glances and side comments and nasty, hateful things. And how I've internalized it, and believed it. And that's when the Aha! moment came. *All this time, I've been so worried about all the bullying that other people did, I wasn't even thinking about all the bullying I did to myself.* https://media.giphy.com/media/12KiGLydHEdak8/giphy.gif All this time, *it was me.* Sure, it was other people who planted those seeds, but it was me who perpetuated it, who told myself that they were true. After all, if you say something enough, it might as well be as true as anything else. So there it is. There's one step. It might just be one step, but it's a step in the right direction. There's my holy shit moment of the day, and I just wanted to share with you all. There is hope. There is progress. There is love. And I hope you all are able to find it. ",CPUihlein.txt

0,"According to the mental health nurse i'm not depressed So since october 2016 i've been (or at least thought I had) been depressed. I dropped out of school, started self harming and was put in hospital twice among other things. I spent nearly the whole of 2017 at home doing nothing because I simply couldn't. I got a full time job in september but I hated it and it made me worse and I had to quit after I started self harming again and have been cutting up until now (i'm 18 by the way if that's important). Things have been getting worse again recently. I'm cutting almost every night and feel down and just cant do anything. I don't even have the energy to shower most days and just stay in bed until the late afternoon. However I was hopeful for today as I was going to see a new nurse who I was hoping would be able to set up a plan to help me. I was with the child services before and had an amazing nurse who helped me greatly but as i'm 18 i'm classed as an adult so have to go to the adult services. So as soon as I met the new nurse and we went into the room to talk she told me she knows almost nothing about me despite there being many notes from the past year. I told her about leaving my job and feeling low and the self harm and everything and what she basically told me is ''you aren't depressed''. She said that my self harm was normal as it was just scratches and I wasn't cutting deep enough to leave any scars which just completely confused me considered i'd been put in hospital partly for doing the same thing before. I've also suffered with terrible social anxiety all my life and find it very hard to communicate with others. I told her the only friends i've ever had was the friends I've made years ago when I first started going to school and what she said was it sounds like I have great social skills as i've been able to make friends. It honestly felt like she wasn't listening to a single word I was saying. As I said she had no notes from before and was basically just assuming what was wrong with me and that was it. Also I should add i'm in the UK so this is with the NHS so i'm not paying for this however my parents have said they would be willing to pay for some sessions with a therapist if that's was I need. I'm sorry if this is long or it just sounds like i'm complaining. I just wanted other peoples opinions on this as I just don't know what to think. ",rhino98.txt
1,"Stuff goes nuts as soon one gets mad.  As if somehow civility is erased from our brains and mindless matter comes out of our mouths.  Blows thrown at breakable things as if relief of someones frustration is inevitable.  Things twist as a tale changes and turns from moderate to worse.  My wife begged me to let her go her parents house,  while I shaked my head in disapproval.  So I said ""ill make you a deal, I let you go but you clean the house tomorrow.  And get everything ready to go...and I mean everything! including me! get my clothes ready."" As time progressed somehow my wife lost track of time.  Then the time came for me to get ready to go to work.  My stuff wasnt ready as we agreed.  I let my wife know that im about to leave and im not taking her to her moms house.  She gets mad and storms out of the room while screaming  "" I have RIGHTS!!""  me thinking to myself.. ""Fuck man... I have the right to enforce what we had agreed on.""  The arguments got worse as she decided to resolve to threats of what she wasnt gonna do anymore. Of course that incensed me beyond borders of sanity as I thought on my head ""hey its not my fault you took forever in getting ready!!"" We went off to work and she dropped me off.

0,"I've had a rough time of things lately, which is partly what made me search for this site. I've had recurrent unipolar depression since my mid teens with an associated anxiety disorder and a panic disorder that took root 5 years ago after I beat a drink problem I had at the time (between the age of 22 and 25 I used alcohol as a bit of a crutch which was a huge mistake). Anyway these days I am teetotal, on anti depressants and only really get a bad time with my depression A during the winter months or B if something triggers an episode (circumstantial). Usually it lifts up in the summer months (I think I might get a bit of SAD) but last year my mother passed away on the 23rd of March and it caused a huge crash in my mood which never lifted in time before the winter episode took hold. I dealt with it by comfort eating (I do comfort eat at times, but I also get bad food cravings in the winter for foods such as chocolate, cheese and carbohydrates, so pizza and chocolate ice-cream became my regular fodder for a while). Anyway that lead to weight gain which is besides the point but which I was planning on correcting (as I have done before) this summer when the food cravings wear off and my mood lifted. Unfortunately it's not lifted as of yet due to recent circumstances. Not only did I have the first anniversary of my mother's death to deal with, but my partner whom I loved very much decided that this would be the best time to dump me and completely rip me to shreds in the process. He basically emailed (he lives in another city) a few days before the anniversary of her death saying he wanted to end it. I tried to contact him but he wouldn't talk on the telephone or by voice, and would not respond to any emails I sent him. He then contacted me by IM on the day of her anniversary (23rd March) to rip me to shreds and tell me that he couldn't love someone like me before posting publicly on his journal running me down before posting disturbing replies to some of the posts on my journal anonymously (but I recognized his ISP number so I know it was him even though he denied it) making it sound as though the whole thing was deliberate. I wouldn't mind but it came out of the blue, the night before all this started he was discussing a work transfer to move to where I am and signed off with 'I love you'. Next day, wham. I'm social phobic so don't really have many friends I cant talk to about this, my mother was usually the one id turn to but she isn't here anymore, so my mood, although it usually lifts at this time of year, has taken a nose dive and I'm having trouble getting myself motivated again. The emotional pain I felt on that Thursday was like nothing I had felt for years, I just literally felt like my heart had been ripped out of my chest. I couldn't sleep and I couldn't eat for the best part of that week, although I'm eating and sleeping again now. Am I over reacting to what he did, because I'm hurt as hell and completely and utterly infuriated with him at the same time? I know I can be slightly prone to being a bit of a drama queen at times (over reacting to stuff) and I can sometimes be a little paranoid. But the whole thing felt deliberate as though he intentionally intended to hurt me, and even now when I try to contact him to get answers he is being spiteful and running me down. Of course after this I spat a whole load of vitriol at him and now I'm being painted as the one that was in the wrong, and he is saying he did nothing that warranted the vitriol and is the innocent party in all of this. Of course he also interprets home truths as vitriol, and I tend to be very open and say things as I see them, to the point of lacking tact now and again. But whilst I'm willing to stand up and say I made a few mistakes and apologize, he is acting as though the blame is all mine and he did nothing wrong. I just can't seem to make him understand that the way he went about ending the relationship was one of the most hurtful ways anyone could have done it. I know he claims to suffer from bipolar disorder which he wont get treatment for, and I know that can make him highly moody, but I cant understand why he doesn't understand the hurt he caused me, or if he does, how someone who professed to love me, doesn't even seem to care. He seems totally and utterly cold, so cold it's chilling. I know he gets periods of emotional flatness because he told me, and he also told me he hears voices as well. Could he be suffering from some kind of depression related psychosis? One post he made to my journal was: Wisdom comes only to those who seek it, and sometimes to those who deserve it regardless of perfection, intent or even understanding. The common denominator though, seems to be deed. For one must do, or be done to, in order for wisdom to take root. Am I misreading that? Or reading into it? So am I over reacting? Was I wrong to argue back with him? How can I move on and get my motivation back again? ",angelofshadows_e_2_b_1_uk.txt

1,"Hi there.  I don't plan on telling anyone I know about this blog spot. Fuck it. I have been on an eating binge since Friday.   On Friday I ate mushrooms and had an awesome time hanging out with some people I am just getting to know. It does seem however that I am not going to be hooking up with one of the girls like I had hoped.  Which makes about 31 times in a row for me to fall into that gray area called the friend with no benefits zone.   I am going to be a dick from now on.  Not that I feel like a dick but I don't want to be disappointed  by some shitty friendship where I get to hear some girl cry about her exotic exboy friend.  Fuck him.  That pillow biter. Fuck her.  I cover the tabs and she knows why.  Once a month she might pretend she wants me over after he neglects to call her because he is getting it some where else. And God forbid I summon the courage to bust a move.  Even on an eight of strong mushrooms I can't put aside my cowardice and at least offend someone with my rotten cigarette breath kisses.  I had gum.  My trip lasted way longer than everyone else and she clearly did not want me to even sleep on her couch but I couldn't just up and drive home, i was seeing 8 of everything and they were all melting.  I did feel bad wandering around the tiny apartment zapped out of my mind while she slept.  I did bug out at the beginning of the night.  There were about 45 minutes to an hour where I could not bring myself to say one word.  I think everyone else was starting to think that either I was retarded, angry with them, or even more retarded.  Lucky I did break out with some good material and get some good laughs.  So did my friend's cousin,  she also had some funny moments.  I keep sending weird text messages this girl.  I even called her and left a message with the excuse that I couldn't find my wallet just so she would call me back and tell me it wasn't at her apartment.  but to most people this probably isn't a new trick.  what is wrong with me.  why don't girls like me?

1,"im lost without her but I don't know what to do So me and my best friend of about 7 years stopped talking and being friends essentially, around a year ago. We had been fighting a bit before and it kind of led up to this. So what kind of started it off was the fact she got a new boyfriend who was and I swear still is, the biggest jerk of all time. I can see now that it probably wasn't my place to tell her that but I was only looking out for her and she used to appreciate advice like that from me in the past. Then she started pretty much ditching me for him and taking his side and telling him things that were private and I felt like she was slowly kicking me out and replacing me. And I told her that, but she didn't see it because she had her new guy and it was kind of like she didn't care because she had someone there for her. She also lost a couple other friends before this happened pretty much due to the same reasons so I didn't feel that bad at first because I was kind of like you know ""she did this to herself, she made this choice"". But now, I really miss her and I hate that we stopped being friends because I kind of need her. Im not sure what to do. She did actually text me about a month after we stopped talking and was like ""hey, I know we don't talk anymore but I wanted to see how you are going"" and I actually ignored it because I was angry and didn't care but now I kind of see it was a bitch move. And I don't know how to text her or talk again because its awkward and she's still with this guy and I'm pretty sure he hates me and I juts don't know how to handle it. But I really want to make this right again. Any help would be really appreciated :) ",quietppb.txt

1,"21/F/US Looking for a long term friend Hello! My name is Mousey and I live in Georgia. I’ve been very busy with school, work, and starting my own business. I’m looking for people I can have serious connections with. I used to have a best friend in the UK whom I talked with every day all day. So, time zones don’t really bother me. I have an open mind, and I love sharing thoughts and ideas with people. I love learning new things (and since I have an awful memory- you can teach me the same thing three times and I’ll be excited every time lol) I am currently studying to be a middle grades teacher in the fields of science and social sciences. I also have a chinchilla and a hedgehog. They’re wonderful babies and I’ve had them for a long time now (they’re my heart) I am pretty blunt and open to receive and give advice. I really want someone who i can share my daily life with, and they can share theirs with me. Funny pictures, goofing off, hard experiences we encounter, the whole nine. I miss having that connection with someone. I’m not looking for a specific gender, age, or region. I just wanna spend my time and experiences with someone who will become special to me!(: I’m not sure if this helps or hurts me here- but, I’m not really into anime or gaming (I thought I would throw that in there because of the people on here seem to enjoy those things) A lot of people also tend to be into computer science, and that’s okay! But, I’m going to tell you now that I’m pretty technologically impaired so I won’t be able to hold a conversation about it with you :P If you’re okay will all of these things then just shoot me a message, I can’t wait to meet you!(: ",ATiredChromosome.txt

When I left school I moved to Johannesburg and from there moved to my mom in Mpumalanga, South Africa, a day before my 21st birthday I got raped ..... the most terrible feeling ever, I was not wearing any revealing clothes, had jeans a t-shirt and tekkies on, how do you explain this. I always believed that those girls, wearing the most revealing clothes are the ones that ask for it, but do they really?  I can not see how any one can ask for this, it is the worst thing that can ever happen to you.  A few months thereafter I had to have an abortion due to the fact that I could not keep the baby ...... I was way too young, I never and still up until date, don't believe in this type thing, but now I think?  Was it the right thing to do, will you ever be able to face the child the same way you will face a child born into a happy and wonderful marriage? I also suffer from depression, high blood pressure and all those wonderful things, I got married in December 2005 and due to me and my fiance having a big argument with my dad, he never walked me down the aisle on my big day and me and my husband had to pay for the whole wedding, I feel awful, but the things my dad said and done can never be forgiven.  My stepsister had a baby at the end of December and she is getting married now in April 2006, guess who is doing and paying for her wedding ..... I feel sick, sick of people always walking over me, always stuffing it in my face and my frustration gets taken out on the wrong people, my husband is the one getting it?  I battle to have healthy sex, due to the fact that every time I close my eyes, I see this person on top of me, forcing himself in, I feel guilty to have kids, how can I have more, if I killed one? How can I bring up a family if my own family is up to shit .... I often find myself wondering why? Why me, why am I the one crying myself to sleep, why do I have to keep myself in tone, to prevent a stroke, especially at my young age?? ",jahe_e_2_b_c3q_sa.txt

1,"Best guy friend is ignoring me, and I don't understand why My best guy friend ""Jake"" (not his real name) have known each other for 14 years. We are now both 19 years old. Of all the friends I currently have, I've been friends with Jake the longest. We first met in kindergarten. I used to be really chubby and shy when I was much younger, so I got picked on a lot. Jake was my only friend back when I was in elementary school and middle school, and he stood up for me a lot back then. In high school, I started to grow out of my childhood awkwardness, lost a significant amount of weight, and managed to find a small group of friends in my school's anime club. Throughout all this, Jake was a very steady, loyal, and supportive friend, and I'm forever grateful to him for that. We ended up getting into different colleges, both around an hour away from our hometown. Even though things got somewhat busy at times, we kept in regular contact and found time to hang out when we were both in our hometown at the same time. Recently, I met a great guy ""Aaron"" (not his real name) in college. We started dating. I wanted him to meet my friends from back home, so I arranged a time to meet for dinner. During our meetup (I invited 3 friends from high school, including Jake), I noticed that Jake was unusually quiet. He didn't say much of anything during our dinner. I thought it was a bit weird because he is normally really talkative (I'm usually the quieter one in our friendship), so I pulled him aside and asked him what's wrong. He said nothing, so I figured nothing was wrong. That meetup was two months ago. About two weeks ago, I reached out to Jake on Facebook to ask him how things are going and to try to catch up on life. He completely ignores all my messages. I tried texting him to ask if he's mad at me. No response. I don't understand. I feel completely blindsided by this because Jake has never gone more than one day without responding to my messages. A mutual friend told me that she always suspected that Jake liked me, but I highly doubt that. He never showed any signs of liking me back when we were in high school, and he had a couple of girlfriends in high school. He's not the shy type, so I highly doubt he would be the type of guy to hide his feelings for so many years. ",jar_of_hearts123.txt

1,"You wanna know why this girl looks how she looks?  Well this poor little girl was forced by me to talk with me  for more than an hour.  Hmm you wonder why I did this?  Well lets start with the background  Since Simon (a class mate of mine) invited us to a grill party, this became a tradition. The photo was taken at such a party and me being very drunk started  to talk to every girl telling her such great things like  ""You're the horniest in our gradates!"" or ""You can run but I'll  always find you""  Well for this not being embarassing enough I looked for a victim I can talk to for longer time, well there she was!  This time I was in love with a chubby cheeked girl named Karen. Luckily my ""conversation partner"" was the best friend of her. So the conversation was only about how Karen and I match together.  You can imagine that me being very drunk said things, which I had better not said.  Finally I can only say that I don't remember all the stuff I told her, but my opinion about relationships and what is important in such relationships were the best things I told her, because now everybody knows what a horny  guy I am with my 17 years.  Well this evening seemed to be a turning point of my imagination for a  relationship with Karen, because later she wanted to clear some things, between me and her. This resulted in a telephone conversation for about nearly two hours. The only thing I can conclude from this session is that she is an ecological cunt, who thinks that she is something better than others.  One reason, which lets me conclude so is that a friend of her told me that Good-naturedness was the only reason why she talked to me.  Well I didn't knew that every person, who talks to me is just good natured. I don't think that conversation is a thing of Good-naturedness, because if so the world will get egoistically and it will become a privilege to talk to someone else.  Sorry but here it seems that sombebody stayed too long in the broad sunlight. Maybe she planted too many patches, which is what she does right at the moment :D  This is it for now, I hope you enjoyed reading this and I hope I could give you a small view of my life.

1,"Friend is acting distant, not hanging out much, i don't know what to do. *Apologies ahead of time for the novel.* So i (M 30s) have been friends with my buddy (M 30s) for several years, and there seems to be a repeating pattern with him and i really don't know what to do when this happens.  Instead of a long history, i'll just cite these last few months as an example. So as i said, we've known each other for quite a while.  He's probably my best friend, although i wouldn't say i'm his (i'm not sure he really has one).  But anyways, prior to the last couple months we were hanging out as we usually do.  If we don't hang out every other day, we'd usually catch up over voice chat while playing video games, etc...  And this is the normal routine for us, we'd talk or hang out at least every other day, if not more often.  Then suddenly, a few weeks ago, it's like a switch went off and he's out. What i mean by that is since then, i may hear from him once a week for an hour or so, at best; sometimes longer.  When we do chat, he mostly seems normal, but i can tell he's off.  So i've asked him what he's been up to, what's going on in his life, you know the usuals, and i get the usual answers for him: work, playing video games, seeing his parents occasionally.  I've brought up his absence and asked him what's going on, and his answer is usually the standard runaround, ""oh nothing"", ""i've just been avoiding everyone"", ""just doing my own thing"".  I pressed a little harder a couple weeks back and got a jokingly put ""i guess i've got a serotonin imbalance, haha"". I could sense his desire not to talk about it (which he never does, he hates discussing anything feelings related), so i let it go. Next time we spoke, i brought it up again, asked him how he was doing with his issues, and got the usual ""meh"" or ""i dunno"".  When i asked what i could do to help him, he answered, ""you can stop fucking asking me about it"", so i of course let it go, and our convo continued as if there were no problems.  But of course there are, he's still MIA for weeks at a time.  The thing is, this is a pattern with him.  We're normal buddies, seeing/chatting all the time for months, and then WHAM, he's out and like this for weeks or a few months.  Then as if another switch goes off, he's back on again and acts normal and as if nothing's happened.  This has happened more times than i can count. You know i wouldn't be so concerned if he were actually busy with life and doing things, but as he tells it in his own words when i do see him, he's doing nothing out of the ordinary (which for him is work and sitting home every night by himself (lives alone) playing video games (something we usually do together).  But as far as i can tell he's just sitting alone by himself every night. I've considered the possibility he's depressed or bi-polar (although you'd never get him to admit that), in which case i don't know what to do if he won't talk to me about it.  I've considered that perhaps i've done something to make him angry, but when he does come around (if i'm not bringing up this issue), he acts completely normal and we laugh and cut up, and whatnot like nothings wrong.  I've thought perhaps he's just not interested in being friends anymore, but he does still come around, and as i've said, after one of these episodes for a few weeks/months it's as if nothing's happened at all. So my problem is this.  I don't know what to do when he's like this.  I don't know how to act, what to say, how to approach him, etc.  You know, he's my best friend, i'd like to be there for him, to help if i can, but he rebuffs any attempt on my part to find out what's really going on, well besides him just ""avoiding everyone right now, and doing my own thing"".  He gets agitated if i push the issue.  So how do i handle this?  Is there a way to broach this topic that would get a better response?  When he does come around, how should i act around him?  What do i say, should i even bring it up?  I'm a very open person regarding my feelings and inner workings, and he's obviously not.  If this is just a thing he does, if it's not my fault and there's genuinely nothing i can do to help, how would i even get him to tell me that's the case if he doesn't like talking about it?  When he gets this way i just feel like i'm walking on eggshells around my best friend.  I dunno if it's ok to text, to invite him around, or whatever cause i'm afraid it's gonna bother him and push him further away. So i'm sure i've left out a lot of details, but i guess that's the gist of it.  I would appreciate any meaningful advice anyone has to offer, especially if anyone around here has experienced anything similar with a friend.  Thanks to everyone ahead of time for replying.

1,feeling betrayed My best friend and I are dating two guys who are also best friends and roommates. At first we all got along great and had a lot of fun. Out of nowhere my best friends boyfriend started voicing how he really felt about me. He told her and my boyfriend (his best friend) that he hates me and can’t stand to be around me. He even said “seeing her is the worst part of my day.” This is only one of many many rude and uncalled for things he has said about me. He acts as though I am a nuisance when I have never done anything to him. My boyfriend and I can’t even be around them anymore because of how bad it’s gotten.

1,"A friend of mine is being mean, or am I sensitive? A long time friend of mine (let’s call her Abby) has recently been a little cruel imo, but I’m not sure if it’s me. These three things happen in less than 2 days and now we’re not speaking. Also, we’re 14 and just started high school. 1: She laughed at my new haircut. I know that sounds frivolous, but Abby and this other girl were literally outright laughing. She claims she was just ‘being honest’. 2: She left me wandering. We had agreed to walk to an after school event together. She started walking without me and didn’t tell me, so I was walking around the high school, sending her a million messages trying to find her. I guessed she had left, but I didn’t want to ditch her if she hadn’t. I eventually just walked by myself. When I got there (late) it turned out she walked with two other girls (including the hair-laughing girl). When I called her out she said I was overreacting and that walking alone shouldn’t bother me (it didn’t, I was upset because she didn’t care about me) and that she wouldn’t care if the shoe was on the other foot. All I asked was that she apologize and next time *let me know* if she changed plans, which earned a sarcastic/sassy ‘we’ll sor-ry’. 3: Another friend of mine and Abby’s (it’s a trio friendship) asked to hang out (her name will be Robin). Abby didn’t come which I was kind of glad about, so it was just me and Robin. We walked around town and all. It wasn’t even very late (6:00) when this one group of guys (4 of them, 18ish) hollered at us from their car. At first we thought it was a prank, but it kept going. They did this multiple times, following us or looping back around to greet us. We were getting freaked out. So, when they loop back around again I’ve had enough. I yelled at them to F*** off. I thought this was smart. I figured they’d either realize we weren’t having fun or something. Surprise, surprise, it made things worse. A lot worse. Eventually, they got stuck at a light and we sprinted to a family members house nearby (who turned out had recently been hospitalized) and hid there until my Mom came. Now, I know the F off move was incredibly dumb. I made it worse not only for myself but for my friend. Either way, the next day I was feeling guilty as hell and worried about Robin and what she thought of me and was just stressed in general. Not in a good mood. I don’t even tell my friend what happened, she greets me with weird hints about last night. So I simply ask her to stop with these weird hints and actually talk to me. Basically, Robin told her about last night. So Abby being super nice says, to the best of my memory, “You realize your mistake, right? You understand that it was your fault. So just so you know, I have no sympathy at all.” I know I was dumb, but hearing this after everything and what I already blamed myself for being told so bluntly and harshly at me by my friend set me off. I left and actually went and cried in the girls washroom that I know no one ever uses. I’m not sure what I expected, it was my fault, but she *greeted* me like this. No, “Hey, I heard you were followed...” or ANYTHING. Just straight up “it’s your fault I have no sympathy.” Like, Hey, nice to see you too. Either way, we’re not talking anymore. I’ve tried to bring it up but it’s always, “I was just being honest... what did you expect? So you want me to lie? You’re being silly...” No acknowledgement. Also, this fight between me and Abby is affecting my friendship with Robin because it was a trio friendship. Also, Abby is my only friend at my school, I’m scared to be alone. Sorry for how long this is, I think it’s sort of a rant too. What should I do? Am I completely out of line? How should I go about fixing this? At the very least, how can I prevent this from affecting me and Robin? ",ravenfeather1234.txt
1,"My Friend is Draining Me Apologies, this is a very long post! I’ve been good friends with a girl for around 10 years since we were teenagers. She moved overseas around 5 years ago. She used to be such a fun, bubbly and funny person until she met her boyfriend around 3 years ago. Looking back, I can see that she was a always bit crazy and insecure (her father is emotionally abusive and tells her she’s worthless and stupid), but meeting him seems to have exacerbated all her bad qualities. She has a really low self esteem and perception issues when it comes to relationships. She also has OCD. She was, and still is OBSESSED with her now ex boyfriend. They had an on off relationship where she thought it was normal to call him “just ten times” in one day, and would get upset and not be able  “sleep or eat” if he doesn’t reply, thinks talking on the phone three times a day is not much, they pushed and shoved each other, she hit him, he talked to other girls and acted like she wasn’t his girlfriend, she’d call his voicemail just to hear his voice, he threatened to hurt her, she considered going to a shitty college just to be near him, etc.. basically an abusive and obsessive relationship with awful communication. Every time she messages me, she’ll ask how I am and ask a few questions, and then steer the conversation back to her numerous problems and her ex. About how she’s so poor (goes out every second night and goes on shopping sprees), how she’s really sad (but won’t see a counselor because she’s “too poor”), how she wants to be confident and independent (goes back to the ex repeatedly and doesn’t listen to any of the advice I give her), tells me she can’t eat or sleep because she’s heartbroken (I told her I was eventually okay after I broke up with an ex, but she brushed it off as I hadn’t gone out with him for as long and how she gave everything to her ex). She also says how I’m so lucky to live with my boyfriend and how I have such an amazing life, as if she’s the only person in the world that has problems. I’ve talked to her multiple times about how talking about her ex all the time and her problems is effecting me (as well as her other friends), and how she should really see a professional as this behavior is really hurting her. She always apologizes and says that she didn’t realize how it might make me annoyed, and she’ll send me an inspirational video or inspirational words, and asking about me before going back to changing the topic so she can talk about herself, her ex and how it’s so hard for her right now, how she feels suffocated and her heart is broken. I understand that people go through hard times in their lives, but this has lasted at least 3 years. I’ve always said how I’ll be there for her and that if she needs to talk to someone, I’ll listen, but I’m starting to feel that this is a one way relationship. The frustrating thing is that she says she agrees to everything I say, and how’s shes going to change, but nothing has changed! She says she’s more confident and doing this and that to help herself, but she just plasters selfies and videos of herself going out with people to try and convince people that she’s having an amazing time. I don’t want to just ignore her, but I don’t think talking to her again will do anything. I’ve been nice, brutally honest, and even angry at her and nothing has changed. She’s stuck in her own tragic world and I’m realizing that maybe she thrives in this drama, and that she’s lonely and needs a boyfriend’s attention to validate her self worth . Our other mutual friend has cut ties with her due to this. I think I have put up with this for so long as we’re not living in the same country.. Sorry about the long rant and formatting, I’m on my cellphone. TL;DR friend who lives overseas is emotionally draining me every time I talk to her.

So, hi, I'm just your typical British kid dealing with the stresses of College but the problem is that I'm not stressed because of college (I don't really care much for it but it's better then work), I'm stressed because of this constant cycle of: wake up, spend an hour trying to get up, be 20 minutes late to everything every day, eat, browse the Internet and sleep. All around me there's people who have clear career paths and know what they're passionate about, but I look at myself and realise that I don't have that. I have no interest in working in a job for the next 45 years of my life because there's nothing that I'd like doing. I'm doing fine in all of my classes (As in History and Cs in Maths, Distinctions in BTEC Engineering, everything just feels too simple) but I just still get these weeks where I feel worthless and pointless. I get brain fog, I end up teary eyed and can't talk to anybody for fear of looking stupid (I have speech problems). But then when I end up actually talking to others I apparently look happy. I have spoken to people at my school about it, but it's the same thing every time. 'Oh you're struggling? We'll have a five minute conversation about your feelings and wait months to make sure you're not still sad'. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety but I stopped taking medication in July 2017 and haven't seen a doctor or therapist since. They didn't help, the medication I was on turned me into a god damn zombie and my therapist got exceptionally pissy at me for not telling the truth about my lack of improvement. I felt like I had to lie so I didn't waste their time and mine, I worry that's why I end up wearing a mask 90% of the time. Even around my family, who believe more in self-help then actually getting an actually decent therapist to try and help me. I'm ashamed to talk to them about it, no matter what anyone says, trust me when I say that they will NOT understand. I have been incredibly clear about it all and got mocked for it, some people just don't want to learn. I had a pretty bad childhood that I try to justify my problems with (dealt with a lot of sexual abuse and my mother died in 2013) but when I'm having these 'days' I'm not thinking about anything in particular that would make me flighty. I ended up admitting a lot of my past to one teacher last week who I admire greatly and whom pretty much just saved my life and I am still cringing today. I know I have no reason to cringe either, I just get so nervous of social interaction. I just don't get why the universe picked me to be its miserable little experiment. I never asked for anything bad to happen, I never asked to constantly feel tired and under the weather, I know that life isn't gonna be perfect but why is it that day after dull ass day I have to feel worse and worse? I try to take responsibility for my health, I feel like dirt, I have other people have some part in it and they take it for granted and hardly any of them actually make a big effort on me. Sorry if my words are jumbled and rambled, I just needed a place to vent whilst I still can. ",Vexxyus.txt

But recently he moved overseas and now we for talk 30 mins everyday. My friends are all attending universities while I'm here waiting for the dream I've always had. I've had suicidal thoughts when I was younger, I googled it one day and mistakenly I told my friend. She got so fucking serious. So then I told her it was all a big joke. And it eventually started to look like one. Nowadays, it's getting harder to cope up each and everyday. I can't seem to concentrate on my college apps.

0,"I want to die [trigger warning] [Trigger Warning] My trauma happened when i was 8, I'm now 18 and still suffer from it daily. I actually suppressed the trauma completely until I was 12, when it all came back to me; so I guess I've only really been dealing with it for 6 years now. I have severe PTSD, severe depression, anxiety, severe panic/anxiety attacks, OCD, severe memory loss, and had an intense eating disorder for 6 years that I'm still struggling with constantly. I haven't gotten a good nights' sleep in years. I have constant PTSD nightmares, regular nightmares, and insomnia/constant fatigue and exhaustion. I also disassociate a lot and self harmed for years. Currently clean from self harm for about a year and a half. I've been admitted to a hospital because of all of my mental problems, and honestly wish I could go back sometimes. I was gaslighted for years to believe that my trauma was normal. My home environment was constantly hostile. I go through long periods of feeling suicidal. Currently in that period. Don't know what to do, honestly. Years of being in therapy and being prescribed pills and yet I still am nowhere near being close to healthy. Looking back, I can't even remember the last time I was genuinely happy. The periods of my sadness last longer than my periods of calm. I'm so afraid of waking up when I'm 40 and still feeling the same way I do now. The thing about being an adult that spent their entire teenage years thinking they would have killed themselves by now is realizing that your mental illnesses have real repercussions. I have fucked bones and a fucked stomach because of an eating disorder that lasted so long and a GED because I couldnt find the will to do schoolwork when I was just trying to find the will to live another day and not cut myself again. I can’t afford college because I didn’t do any extracurriculars to get scholarships because the thought of having to stay after school made me want to have a panic attack and i just wanted to sleep. I have no friends because when people invited me to hang out my anxiety made me cry myself to sleep instead. I didn’t have any real thought-out “grand plans” because I was too busy hurting myself and getting high and wanting to kill myself to really sit down and plan things out. I said I wanted to do things but never took the time to think it all through. It doesnt seem fair that I went through this trauma, had/have all of this mental illness, and now have to do with the repercussions of those illnesses. It doesnt seem fair that I'm suffering so much still. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm tired of trying so fucking hard. I know this is self-pitying and 'emo' but I just don't know what to do.

What is this blog about? why's it here? who the hell are you? and why do you think that this deserves to take up valuable internet real estate?   well i'll tell you grasshopper. this blog is a test, a personal test. a test designed to push my own boundaries, and maybe...just maybe bring into being something bigger than just another shitty internet blog.  ultimately, this blog will be a place where i can give wings to my voice and throw open the doors that hold back the whirlwind of emotions and thoughts that dance their way through my headspace. ambiguous enough for you?  on a specific note, i am hoping to eventually provide enough detail about my personality and ideas/ideals that at some point in the future my posts can be used to create a simulacrum of myself. some sort of personality that will capture the essence of what I am about. but that's more of a long term goal.  short term this blog will aim to provide myself with a sounding board for my own thoughts and emotions. a place where I can cry out to my imagined readers and tweak my opinions.  the title of the blog 'generation gap' reflects a deep emotional feeling that I have regarding being labeled by society, and falling down into the generation gap [or generation trap]. hopefully my rantings will address this give the site a 'feel' of changing for the better.  so who the hell am i? i am me! i am someone who is searching. someone who is constantly looking, not sure what he will find, but making the most of the journey of discovery. i am someone who is sick to death of the crap passed down to us by society, in an unconscious attempt to mold us and tell us how to be. i am someone who is trying to push my own boundaries to discover my own mettle and shine in whatever way i can. i am me.  as for why this site should exist, well simply put, cause i want it to. it represents an extention of my will into an infinate void [the interent] where there exists plenty of room for everyone to play. so if you run into this site and don't like it... don't read it, don't come back... sorted. this site exists for me, but if someone else benefits from it then fantastic!  next question.

This is my first time visiting this subreddit, and so I don't know what's generally expected or done on here. Let me just get into this. I'm 22 and I've never experienced depression. I'm a Psychology major and I've taken classes over the topic, but I know reading about it can only give me so much insight. The reason I'm posting on here is because I have a 12 year old cousin who tried cutting herself the other day. She's depressed, says she wants to die, and I am so, so worried about her. She lives a few hours from me and is being watched closely right now, but I plan on going out to visit her this weekend. To be honest, she has a horrible living situation. My aunt (her mom) is awful. To my aunt, every problem can be solved by God, she's financially fucked and letting it out on my cousins, and she's extremely dismissive of my cousins feelings, needs, and emotions. It also doesn't help that my cousin is adopted, and I know she just feels detached from her own family. Anyways, I know that there's no such thing as simply getting your advice on how to fix my cousins depression. I know how complex of an issue this is. What I want to know from you all is if there is anything I can do this weekend to just show her that things can get better. My little cousin has always looked up to me, and I plan on taking her out to do some of the things that she always wants to do (like go to the park, make slime, whatever 12 year olds like). But is there anything extra I can do? Is there anything that you all wish someone told you? Or maybe even something you wish they didn't? I would really appreciate any tips or advice you all have for me this weekend. I know my cousin has a very long road ahead of her, but I want to do anything I can to make it easier. Thank you. tl;dr my 12 year old cousin is depressed and attempting to hurt herself. I'm going to visit her this weekend. Is there anything I can do (or shouldn't do), that might at least show her that things can get better. ",sikecarly.txt

1,"Labour leaders more often than not tell us how they will ""die in the Party"". Blair said that he wasn't born in to the party but he will die in it. I now know that this is a very useful device for making people rule out the idea of ever leaving Labour and it's a phrase that sounds good, and it's one I've copied and used myself for dramatic effect. But when it came to it, when this War criminal leader decided to throw in his lot with George Bush, stayiong in the Labour was not an option. What should have been the most difficult decision I've ever had to make (after 10 years flogging my guts out for it)  leaving the Labour Party was not only an easy decision but essential. How could anyone stay in a Party that stains itself in the blood of thousands of Iraqi civilians, dropping cluster bombs on them against the will of the UK and International community, against the UN, against the Law and for George W Bush, Rumsfeld, Cheney - Financial and War criminal one and all - and with the Tories, Berlusconi, John Howard, and Aznar.  We couldn't even be bothered to count the bodies. If anyone stayed in the Labour Party after Abu Graihb I wonder what they joined the Labour for in the first place. If it wasn't for justice and for an ideal that may or may not be obtainable, at least it was aspirational for humanity. I can't even begin to list the sheer number of crimes against people, society and democracy that this Labour Party has been responsible for and every single member is to blame. Your money has paid for a montrous, election winning machine that believes in privatisation, War and inequality. All the talk of saving the Labour Party from Blair is to miss the point. When a Party becomes part of the problem it doesn't deserve to survive. The dead children in Iraq will never be brought back. A new leader will not be able to lessen the personal pain I feel knowing that by helping to elect this Labour Government I also have blood on my hands. The Tories would never have got the votes in the Commons to conduct such a filthy War. Only a Labour Party wilting at the feet of it's Leader could have pulled this off. I will never rejoin the Labour Party and stand shoulder to shoulder with people who justify slaughter in such an ignorant detatched manner. My new pledge is that I will die outside the Labour Party.

0,"My weight is ballooning out of control. I take daily: 40 MG of Prozac (in the morning);  1 MG Klonopin (same time): 1 MG Klonopin (5 PM) 1 MG Klonopin (bedtime), prescribed by a psychiatrist. I also take 1000 MG Keppra at bedtime for migraine prevention (prescribed by a neurologist). I've been on various combinations of these for a couple of years. The psychiatrist is doggedly insistent that the medications I'm on shouldn't be making me gain weight - but nonetheless they are.  I've had other medications that have given me side effects that I ""shouldn't"" have had - but nonetheless I do. I have read many, many stories on the internet and through direct conversation with others that say they have had exactly the same things happen with SSRI's. When I've asked him to change the medication, he keeps preaching ""diet and exercise"".  It hasn't worked.

He has my son two days out of the week and for his birthday I gave him three to be nice (there’s a reason I don’t want him having more bc he can not handle stress) but when he dropped my son off he told me he now wants him for a week meaning I have my son one week and he gets the other but I don’t want that because I think it would be too stressful for my 10 month old so I told him I’ll take him to court which the father does not want .

0,"I'm not worth it I just don't feel like I'm worth anyone's time or effort, and I just feel like a burden to everyone. I have a part time job (anywhere between 20-39 hours a week) and I'm at college (in the UK &amp; I'm 18)and I'm constantly tired. My mum is such a lovely person, but I really do feel like she'd be better off without me, she's always complaining how she never has time to do anything (she works 30 hours a week + she always cooks + cleans up after my stepdad and brother but complains about any mess I've made)  and I'm lazy, messy and I quite often ruin her day. But I'm sure I've ruined her whole life. She had me when she was 19, which meant she had to quit her job because she couldn't afford childcare and she had an abusive step-dad, who would refuse to let her mum look after me, and she also fell out with her very religious grandparents as she wasn't married (they have since made up). She then couldn't get a job until I started school (which is actually a decent job). At this new job, she met my step-dad (after a few years) and they've since had a child together (who also doesn't seem to like me one bit). My step dad seems to hate me more than my mum does, but I can't complain because neither of them are abusive, and this is one of my problems; I feel like I shouldn't moan about anything in my life; I live in a decent sized 3 bedroom house, I have an education and I also have a job. Whilst my mum lived with her abusive step-dad, was forced to quit college (so she could get a job to start paying rent) and was also forced to baby sit whilst her parents went out drinking every other night. Yet here I am, never feeling happy, without many friends (I talk to the people at work when I'm there and I have 2 other friends that I speak to around twice a month, normally because there other friends are busy and they want to complain about their boyfriends, or because the other friend doesn't want to go  shopping on her own ( another reason why I don't have a reason to be negative; she was in care and now classified as homeless as she's now 18 and not catered for in the care system, so now she has to live in temporary accommodation with lots of drug users in the same building.) I feel like I just ruin everything, if I'm downstairs with my family, there always seems to be an argument, even if I'm not involved in the argument. But if everyone else is in the living room, whilst I'm upstairs in my own, I can only ever here them laughing and enjoying themselves. It's like, even when I haven't done anything, I seem to just produce a negative atmosphere. I really don't want to be here anymore, if I disappeared, it wouldn't really effect any one, my mum might be upset at first but she'd quickly realise how much better her life is without me. The problem is that I'm even too lazy and stupid to kill myself, so I'm just secretly hoping that a medical issue that has been ongoing for a while (and I haven't been to the doctor's in years because I would just be wasting their time, when they could be helping someone better than me) is serious, and nature will take its cause...

1,"I'm a [M/17] A guy and I both know each other but never spoke a word, how can I approach him. Before telling you about my problem that I seek advice for, let me tell you about my personality. I don't have any real friends, I just have acquaintances, if you will, people who I see in school mostly and spend some time with occasionally, I find myself to be happier this way since I could focus more on what I like most (Science and music) I basically spend a vast majority of my time alone even when I go out to the cinema or to get dinner I have no one but myself, I was like this since I was a kid, so due to this my social skills aren't great, I turn red most of the times when I speak to new people and just wish I'd turn into a tree just so I could escape the situation. However, I can speak on a stage in front of thousands of people if I had to, as long as it is not a direct interaction or I already know the people I'm speaking with, I am good. With that said, over the past year, I found myself trapped in a social situation beyond my understanding, I genuinely don't fully understand how this relationship (If you could call it that in the first place) developed in the first place but here is a recap of what happened. A little bit over a year ago in my school. Some guy and I sat around the same table in the library, this happened because the library was packed that day and there was no other place other than that table, so we just sat opposite to eachother not saying a word, and I'm pretty sure each one of us didnt know that the other existed in the first place, days went by and everyday I went to the library I'd sit in the same place and the same goes for him, even when the library was completely empty we'd sit in the exact same place, by this time we knew eachother but never spoke a single word I guess we got used to eachother and if a day went by without one of us being there I'm pretty sure we'd feel a bit blue. By the time we were done with our exams we stopped coming to the library and did not see each other that often until our classes got moved and my homeroom happened to be just opposite of his, and this is where the bollocks started, we got to see one another way more often, In the corridor, the bathroom, on the way out to the buses, and as we passed by eachother, we'd always just stare at eachother still not speaking a single word, we both know eachother but pretended that we didn't. We would find our selves in group conversations since we have mutual friends, we still wouldn't directly speak but if I say a joke he's going to laugh and vice versa. I developed some kind of liking for this guy, I almost consider him to be a friend although we never spoke, I'd like to say hi, but as I said before I will probably turn so red that I'd melt, and even if I was courageous enough and had the social skills to do so I don't even know if he wants to talk maybe he doesn't like me or consider me a friend, maybe I'm just an obnoxious kid he sees way too often. Now we see each other every day in the morning, I don't know how the hell it happens but we go to the restroom at the same exact time in the morning (I guess we both arrive at the same time). So this is a short version of what happened, this is bugging me and I've been losing sleep over it, what do I do? Sorry for the long post and rubbish grammar (English isn't my first language) Thanks in advance. ",DemonicAsteroid.txt

1,"How do I end this, or can I fix it? ok, so it's kinda a long story.. but me and my best friend met in high school, we clicked right away, there was this bond ( and kinda still is? ) between us, we would never separate, always talking etc. Still in highschool she cut me out of her life sudendly for a whole year. I dont know why I continue trying to talk to her, but maybe it would have been better for us if it had end there, and eventually she came around and asked to go out with her, we didnt talk at all about that, she just gave me a note saying why she did that, wich honestly didnt tell much except saying she has depression and didnt know what she was doing...She said she always hurts everyone so she cut me out. Years later, we didnt talk that much as before, but were still really good friends, then I started to notice that me or other friends counldn say anything to her if it was something that upset her. Sometimes it was so stupid that she got mad at me because I didnt agree with her opinion over an actor... She would rage in games with everyone, and stop talking.. now the part that hurts me like hell is that she would cut us all out of her life, for like weeks, then come back like nothing happen. She would never tell me whats wrong, if I tried to talk about more serious stuff she would step away again. Eventually I got tired, and told her that we couldnt go on like this. So I stoped talking to her, 2 months later I decided to give another shot, what happen was exactly the same. So I stoped talking again, and I though it was for good, we only talked when we were with all our friends etc. Then I learnt a few months later that she wanted to commit suicide. She actually tried it, said her mom, and was admited to an hospital. I was heart broken, thinking about losing her forever took over my jugdment... So I went to the hospital, and we talk normally. Then after she got out we had a conversation, face to face, about her stoping doing all that to me, she said she was going to try, and promised me, PROMISED ME that she would tell me when something was wrong, or when she would like to be left alone so I didnt worry as much, and that she would talk to me if I ever said something wrong about her. Everything was going great, amazing really. I could tell she was better with her medicine and all, but that only last 3 months. Now she had a problem with a boy she likes or something, pretended that everything was ok, despited her answers said otherwise, and started ignoring me. I was mad and said, some things never change, and she responded to me saying she was a lost cause. I wrote a whole text to her saying I want to be her friend, but that will only work as long as shes honest with me and stops pushing me away... she wanst answered yet. she also never said to me that shes sorry she hurts me, even thoug I say that to her when I hurt her.

0,"It’s not some fucking sadness anymore. This is madness. I remember when I just had a few days when I felt sad and out of it. And I would worry but then everything became better a few days later. Still, I went to a psychologist, because my downs were too consistent to be considered normal. It all went downhill from there. I feel like I’ve lost a part of myself. My personality, my identity, whatever. I feel like when I talk to others I’m not “there”, like I’ve lost control of what I say and think. Like I’ve lost my mind. Like others are normal and I’m in my own world, going through life on automatic mode, not knowing what I should think, say, or do. Even though from outside people might say I’m completely normal, even sometimes better than before, I feel like mentally, inside, the world is going down. My life is crumbling. Like piece by piece I get further away from a solution. Things that seem to work for others don’t work for me. I hate it. It’s not just a “bad mood” anymore. It’s feeling like I’ve lost my way, and there’s no signs to get back. Like a loop I can’t get out of. That’s why suicide comes up as an option.

0,"Can’t fix anything in my life I’m such a fundamentally broken person. I’ve want to say I’ve been fighting for years, but that’a not true. All I can do is fucking run away from everything until the day is over. No action I take to improve myself can ever have weight because I’m so godddamn broken that when I try to do something to better myself, it just reminds me of how much of a fucking loser I am. I cannot handle the fucking *pain* that comes with self improvement. It’s not fun in the least. It’s humbling. Too humbling. And it just shoves in my face all the time I’ve wasted and all of the experiences I never had simply by virtue of being my self. Everyone who’s happy acts like life is just some natural occurrence. Like things just happened to them and fell into place. This couldn’t be further from the truth of my experience. Nothing ever just happens organically. Either I try hard and fail due to my lack of intelligence, or I don’t do anything at all. It’s hard to stay happy after constant failure and social rejection. I’ve never had interests or goals or relationships or friends. I never will. These thing don’t just happen. You have to be a certain kind of person for them to happen. I am not that person. I will never be that person because I don’t even know who I want to be, and if I figured that out I would be too insecure to become that. All I see in my future is homelessness and destitution because I came into adulthood with absolutely zero interests, special memories, or relevant/helpful past experiences. My memory of my life in general is so goddam hazy at this point, if I ever did have those things, they have long been gone to the abyss. I just think why. Why do I have to be so broken and dysfunctional among everyone else? I’m not even a real person. I’m a complete shell of what could have been a person. This is too difficult to come to terms with, while impossible to argue against. It is true. It is my reality. It honestly just makes me angry, bitter, and jealous of others, at a very deep, fundamental, human level, for what the healthy people have. I fantasize about taking two AR-15s and unloading on people. Maybe I know them, maybe I don’t, it wouldn’t matter. Often lives completely lose their value when my headspace gets dark enough. Not as the result of an “illness” but of the fact that I am who I am both physically and psychologically. Blind rage. That is what the result of my dysfunction is. Pure fucking anger at both the world and myself. Unable to cope with my grim reality, all I want to do is destroy. The only thing I could ever really destroy is myself. The thought of my life slipping away becomes more attractive by the day as I see how impossible my desires are and how completely fruitless any effort to change is sure to be, just like it always has. I can’t handle the responsibility of being alive and I don’t want to anymore. I’m just here for the hedonistic pleasures life sometimes offers, until either I or something else kills me.

0,"Hi, I'm pretty sure I'm suffering from depression, and probably have been for the last 18 months or so. It's only been lately that I feel like the rug has really been jerked out from under me, though. I think it started in mid-2004 when I became seriously ill. Between June and September 2004, I spent three weeks in the hospital, umpteen visits to the E/R, and finally, major surgery to correct the problem. Physically, I'm fine now. But we had no health insurance (long story), and when the hospital bills started rolling in, we tried our best to pay the bills, but there was just no way. We ended up filing bankruptcy, I lost my home business, and we very nearly lost our home. Ever since then, I've felt like I'm falling down a dark tunnel, even though the bankruptcy is over with. I was drinking part of this time, but have stopped, thinking that may have been causing the problem. But it's actually become worse since I've stopped.  Here's my ""symptoms"": I don't usually have trouble falling asleep, but I can't seem to stay asleep for more than a couple of hours. It's hard to go back to sleep, so I usually just get up. Weight gain because I find myself eating even when I'm not hungry. The ""comfort food"" thing, I guess. I tend to be a ""stress"" eater, and goodness knows I've had a lot of that lately! I used to enjoy camping and reading books (etc.), but I don't care about any of that anymore. I couldn't sit down now and read a book no matter how much I wanted to. I get through 5 or 6 pages, and totally lose interest. That's depressing in itself, because I used to love reading so much. I have no desire to get out and do anything. I literally close myself up in my spare bedroom every waking hour, only coming out to use the bathroom and to fix supper for my husband. I feel like I have nothing to look forward to. I'm not happy, but I can't pinpoint exactly what would make me happy. I honestly can't think of anything. I have no energy whatsoever.  I've been dealing with a TON of guilt over the bankruptcy. After all, the bankruptcy wouldn't have happened if I hadn't gotten sick, you know? I feel horrible for dragging my husband's credit down along with mine, but the way things were, I couldn't file bankruptcy by myself. Our credit was PERFECT until I got sick. My husband sold a bunch of his personal belongings to help pay bills, as did I, but it was so unfair for him to have lost his stuff on account of me. He's never once complained, but I still feel terrible. I've also been kicking myself for the loss of my home business. I can't help but feel like if it hadn't failed (I couldn't keep up with it during my illness), that we wouldn't have had to file bankruptcy. I've never been a crier, but I sure feel like it sometimes. I can't seem to do anything ""right"" these days. Irritable!!! Throwing stuff, being unreasonable, getting mad about petty things. The one thing I haven't experienced (thankfully) is suicidal thoughts. A few random ""morbid"" thoughts here and there, but nothing I'd ever act on. Last night I took several online self-tests, and all of them said I had mild to moderate depression. One even said severe. I guess the next step would be to go to the doctor, but I don't have a doctor. My sister is taking Zoloft for panic attacks and a PMS disorder, so I guess I'll ask her who she's seeing. What do they do ... just ask questions similar to the online questionnaires? Or? I've been reading about all the different kids of medicines, and found the information about Wellbutrin to be the most interesting. Obviously the doctor would know what I need better than I would, but I sure don't want to take something that's going to make me gain even more weight or feel like a zombie. At least one good thing, though. We do, thankfully, have insurance now. Another issue is my husband and family. To them, depression is something that people should be able to ""just shake off"". They don't understand that I CAN'T seem to ""shake it off"", otherwise, I gladly would. My husband is supportive in other ways, but he scoffed when my sister started taking Zoloft. To them, if they can't ""see"" the problem, it doesn't exist. I'm sure they don't mean to be ""mean"", but they just don't understand. Sorry for rambling. Any suggestions or thoughts?

No it hasn't happen to me but I feel that I'm getting close and it hurts. I don't want to give up but what if he has? What if he's just ""over it""? You know that could be it. I'm all messed up. I should have stuck to the idea that he's too good for me. I told him from the beginning that I'm no good for him but he wouldn't listen. He just wanted what he couldn't have and now he has it he doesn't want it. Why? I'm mean, why do people function like this? I have to admit, I don't exclude myself from this terrible disease. But why? Why do people always want what they can't have? Because it's challenging. That's it.  I need some alone time. Some time to think things through. When I told him yesterday that the longer we are together the more scared I get, I did mean the more scared I get to lose him but as I was thinking today, I think I am scared. I don't know of what because I've been wanting this for so long now. After I got baptized, this just became more real than ever. This is it Antoinette. This is all for real. No joke. So what's so scary about that? I guess this is what they call cold feet. This is the time that the questions start rolling in. Do I really want to tie down so soon? Can I help make it work FOREVER? Will the love last FOREVER? Do I really love him? Does he really love me? Is this really love? Are these even questions you bring up in a deep, deep conversation? Am I being too emotional? I need some alone time. Some time to think things through because this is for real. No joke. I want to do the right thing because deep down inside my little heart, it sure feels like the right thing.

I suppose it is the factor that I was just feeling so much yesterday...But I did not want to feel...At least not on the inside. I miss sensory feeling. I think that I have closed myself off so much from the world that I have protected myself both emotionaly and physicaly.

Basically I joined this forum so I can realize for myself I'm not the only one with problems. My depression has gotten a lot better over the years as certain situations got better too; I have a loving boyfriend whom I have been with for 14 months now, which I'm extremely sure that he has helped me. Next year, well in the fall I will be moving away to college, which I actually think will be a good thing for me. I am also a cheerleader at my school, which doesn't help with my depression I am constantly under pressure about that. I'm also a dancer, my parents have this thing where they like to find every little thing I do wrong. It seems as if nothing I do is good enough or right. Which has lead to my wanting to be alone and not eating. With the stress of dance and cheerleading and my parents constantly telling me I'm fat has lead me to only eat once or twice every other day. I know it is not healthy and I know it is not good, but I personally think its better then cutting and better then trying to overdose on pain killers and every other pill in the house.

1,"I have never met or know what my real father looked like. That changed this week. Also I found out I have two more sisters. So, my wife's family is really into ancestry and tracing lineage all the way back they can. Because of this, my wife really wanted to do 23andme and, being the good husband I try to be, I got her kits as a gift. Fast forward to Monday, the day I got my reports back. I'm scrolling through, ooo'ing and aww'ing at the things I didn't know, and then I go to their DNA relative section. Now, my wife had a few 3rd or 4th cousins who did the kit as well. Not me. I had one half sister listed. I was immediately stunned, because I only knew my real father's name and this girl had his last name. After sending a few messages, we find out that, yes in fact, she is my other half-sister (I have a half-brother and two other half-sisters)! Not only that, but I have two other half-sisters! My whole world was turned upside down this week. Prior to this, I had no interest in finding or knowing my real father. But, after seeing his picture for the first time and seeing how my sisters revere him. I am considering it. ON TOP OF THAT, this whole turn of events is like a Lifetime movie plot. Sadly he was in a car accident last week and was in critical condition. Even if I wanted to reach out, I don't think now is a good time.

0,"I’m losing the girl I’ve been with for 7 years and it’s because of my drug use, really bummed I’ve been with this girl since 9th grade I’m now 23 and I can honestly say I love her with my whole heart. I’ve been abusing drugs of all variety since I was 15, herion, meth, pills, uppers, downers, alcohol, marijuana, research chemicals, it doesn’t matter, but I prefer if it fits into a syringe. I have been to rehab 9 times since I was 15 I’d get sober then relapse sober then relapse sober etc.. I have had legal trouble and been in and out of jail she has been with me through it all, she has always been my better half. No words can explain how blessed I’ve been to have her. This past relapse I was clean for two years before hand and our relationship had never been better we were both happy we both trusted and we both loved no matter what. She helped me get my g.e.d. And she helped me through my grandfathers death (he raised me). I had subtle depression over it I felt like that was normal losing a loved one and all, but I eventually stopped doing the things I was susposed to to maintain my sobriety, I felt like I was cured and no longer needed all the recovery stuff. I was wrong. So one day I decided to take some benzodiazepines and that made me go straight to crystal meth in the time frame of a week I was back shooting meth spending all of my money on it and staying up for days. When on meth I have serious delusions I accused her of cheating on me I actually believed these delusions with my whole heart I felt so betrayed and hurt, I wanted to die. What I feel like really did it was I accused her of cheating on Facebook. Even after multiple people telling me I was wrong I couldn’t believe it, I just KNEW everybody was out to get me especially her, I was very unfair and called her names and called her at all hours of the night, completely out of character of me. After being the good loving boyfriend she knows and loves for two years I suddenly became a monster. I totaled the vehicle I owned and went to jail for possession with intent (Benzodiazepines) possession of marijuana and dui. I sat there for two months (thank god) while I was in there she told me she just couldn’t do this with me anymore and told me she has somebody else in her life, this crushed me. I contemplated suicide while I was in there fought anybody that even remotely rubbed me the wrong way and lost my appetite couldn’t sleep. So I get out and I know that I should just stay away from her because I love her and I don’t want to hinder her pursuing something else, I respected her decision to move on, after all I did publicly humiliate her. So right now I have been sober a month and I feel good in a clear minded healthy way, but I have this hole where she used to be I find myself riding around for hours thinking and crying. I’m very upset that I let this happen, currently I just can’t keep my mind off of her I just want our love and friendship back. I am very depressed and lately I have thought about using again but I would rather kill myself before I do that, I can’t get high anymore I would honestly rather be dead. I’m going to NA meetings, going to church, praying all day, but I can’t seem to ever feel better about losing her no matter what positive things I do. I’d rather be dead then to live without her and I don’t know what else to do. ",agent_00de7on.txt
0,"Long Winded Post From a Failed 30 Year Old I don't even necessarily want to write this but I need to clear my head. I've been a depressed pissant for as long as I could remember. Some of my youngest memories are melancholic and sickly devoid of confidence or even reason. I grew up dirt poor. I remember spending a night pushing a needle through the rubber of my shoes to get the sole back on. My mom had a stroke and an aneurysm but survived. Sort of. She became a wicked, wicked creature who loved pitting me against my sibling and I never came out on top. My entire life has been from the cowering creature perspective. Life isn't experienced but something that happens to me. I joined the Army at 18. I had gotten recklessly married a month prior to shipping to basic. I ended up fucking up and missing a bus which led to a Lemony Snicket series of Unfortunate Events type shit. I went through partial infantry brainwashing but never made it past the build-up. So I ended my career, the only thing I've wanted to do, before it even took off. Luckily, it was more of a ""this isn't working so we'll forget it happened"" type deal and my enlistment ended without anything terrible. But I never recovered. At least back then I had some sort of tenacity. Now? I'm a fucking shell, mate, of what I was. A completely hollow individual. I'm 30 years old. I've no education. I have no passions. I used to enjoy writing but I can't bring myself to write anymore. The moment I try I go back into wounded animal mode. No, this isn't good enough. Nope, neither is this. Why bother? Why try? I can't help but think these things. I'm still married and that is the only reason I haven't killed myself. I did try early on because of relentless hounding from my father in law. It is obvious I'm not what he wanted for his daughter. I can't figure out why I'm alive at all. I can barely live my life. I'm depressed constantly. No matter how happy I know I should be or how wide I smile I'm in the grey of storm clouds that seemed, at least until this subreddit, to be only over my head. I've had so many jobs that I just explosively quit. I've got Intermittent Explosive Disorder as well as depression and anxiety. So I coil up and wind tightly before my brain dumps chemicals that make me explode with no regard for the damage done. I'm currently unemployed. I left my last job like that. I loved my job. I loved the guy I worked for. I earned several raises within a few months and was promoted quickly because I threw my back into that work. It has been too long though. I can't seem to find another job. I can't even bring myself to apply anymore. I don't have a car. I ""rent"" a couple rooms off the main house of my inlaws. I failed so hard in giving my wife a life worth living. She spends her time working and though understands and doesn't mind my unemployment it is killing me. On Dec.12th I lost all interest in anything. I used to escape in video games but now I can't. I load up Ark and just stare. I've anxiety about everything. Recently installed Heroes of the Storm and I played a mean Lili and Abathaur but now I've got butterflies even playing against bots. The smallest, most simple of tasks seems beyond me. I'm stupider than I used to be. How I interpret the simplest of sentences or instruction is out of whack. I have trouble reading though I've got tons of read Omnibuses from Warhammer 40k on my bookshelf. I have trouble speaking. I talk slowly and can barely push out the words off my tongue. I'm only recently able to make phonecalls without losing my mind anxiety wise. I'm so full of regret. I hate what I became. I hate that I married someone and am dragging them through the mud. To never have a real apartment or car. I can't hold a job. I barely take care of the house. I do dishes now but it is a real struggle. I've been thinking a lot more about suicide and I'm already sure I am too cowardly to really do it but I think about it a lot. How it'd hurt my wife but I think it'd be good for her to find someone else. I just don't see the point in continuing. I'm an adult now but I never learned how to properly be an adult. I don't know what to do. There is a burning hole in my chest and I feel guilty that I'm the way that I am. Even on the subreddit. I know people feel that people who've a significant other can't be as depressed but I'm swimming at the bottom of the barrel. I want this all to end. I don't know how to survive. I don't know how people manage it. I don't have that self-preservation sense that keeps people going despite it all. I'm weak. I am weak in ways that I can barely accept. I struggle a lot with the fact 22 veterans a day kill themselves but I'm still around. I carry endless guilt that better people die and I'm still alive. Goddamn it. People are dying from diseases and cancers while I exist. While I can't so much as go outside without feeling like all eyes are boring holes into my psyche. I hate that all I do is sit here and lay in bed. I hate myself. I feel if I don't get this out, even if it is never seen by anyone, I will implode. I'm on medication and it helped my depression but then the reality of my life struck me and I think I'm worse off than I was. At least then I was able to lose myself in video games. Now I'm here with the stark reality. I am not meant for this world. I am too sensitive, too weak, too weak-willed, and too much of a bitch to handle life. I'll go back to lurking now.

I don't know how you guys feel about putting on an act when really you feel so sad that it's hard to breathe, but recently I have been having to act like I am getting better from depression. My roommate confided in me one day when I came back to our dorms that he struggles with depression. He was placed in a foster home after his parents died, and his foster mom committed suicide. After that, his friend also committed suicide, so of course this takes a toll on someones' emotional health. I told him that I started taking meds and going to therapy, and I smile and laugh and act like I am doing better so that he can feel encouraged to get help with his depression. I feel so fake though, even though I am getting help, I don't think it is helping me, my chest has that particular empty feeling and breathing is hard to do. I feel like crying a lot of the times now while I am laying down in bed, and driving to and from class. I would never let my roommate know that I was actually not doing better though. I really want him to get help because I see myself in him, and he is a really good person who doesn't deserve to be sad. I wish depression never existed, it is such a sick disease.

1,"So.... welcome everyone! Yes... after reading many people's online journals, I have decided to start my own online journal.  Today, nothing happened today. I woke up around noon....pretty early for me. I had some ice cream for brunch. My sister needed to go to NOVA to drop off some work to her teacher so i decided to tag along. It was a pretty scary experience; In order to make her 5:00pm deadline, which was thirty minutes away, she sped down the highway like a mad woman. But we made through it.  Afterwards we went to Blockbuster to rent Kill Bill: Volume 2. Normally I despise Blockbuster and I would never support them, but I got coupons in the mail for $0.99. So I finally got the movie and went home....really exciting.  My mom wanted us to clean the house from top to bottom and we promised here that we'd do it. The hours went by and we hadn't gotten to it yet. I pop in the Kill Bill DVD instead. I thought it was pretty good, but i have to admit that some parts were kind of random. My sister was confused the whole time...she usually doesn't get movies like this.  After the movie was done, we realized that it was close to midnight and we hadn't started on any of the shit that we were supposed to. We do a lot of cleaning and finish up around 1:00am.  I apologize for this extremely boring entry but my sister insisted that I start my journal today and nothing interesting or exciting happened.  Oh yeah....I got my senior pictures in the mail today! It actually turned out pretty good. Now I have a dilemma because the slowasses that were taking the pictures took over four hours to do their job and I had to go to work so i left before I can take my outfit pictures. So now i had to reschedule another day so i can finishes the pictures. I don't understand why i have to go out of my way to do have another appointment when those slutty whores at LifeTouch fucked up.  I'm excited because in two days I am flying down to Nashville. I haven't been there since the Christmas holiday and I can't wait to see my family. On that same day, the twelfth of August...it's my birfday!

0,"What Depression is Like For Me. Having depression is like sailing with a hole inside your boat and only a bucket to keep you afloat. Depression is wanting to have friends but are too anxious to go out and stay a while longer. Depression is forcing yourself out of bed, not for yourself but those who count on you. Depression is having an empty feeling inside your chest while your head is crowded with self loathing. Depression is where people tell you ""it will all get better"" but only hearing the silent whispers of the wind. Depression is where you slowly lose your personality, joy, and interest for those things that you have used to love. Depression is where a stranger tells you ""I'll be here for you"" and you take it as an insult. Depression is where you hurt, crawl on the floor crying, grabbing on to dear life alone in your dark room with your thoughts, too tired to do anything and then go to bed only to rise again to pretend that nothing happened. To pretend, nothing happened. ",NofapIsAMust.txt

1,"Close friend suddenly turned cold I have a friend who's had some mental and anxiety issues in the past. We generally chat online, although we've met up in real life a number of times, and talk on the phone sporadically. They have an issue with trust. They believe no one cares about them and that every friend they have will eventually leave them. So fairly insecure. They are currently attending therapy (have for a number of months) to help them with their anxiety. They are meditating etc. At a certain point I stepped up and decided, 'Okay, if they truly believe this about themselves, that people always leave them, I'm going to be the person who doesn't.' For the record, I know of a mutual friend who did push this person randomly out of their life—so as far as I know, it's not a lie. Anyway, I stepped up because I thought this person was pretty special and intelligent. I loved that they were passionate and outspoken and unique. Over time, I developed some feelings for them too but more a great love as a friend than anything too romantic. Anyhow, we grew close. We shared many things, pretty much every day, although I believe she feared that she was abusing the friendship because I would try and reassure her a lot. She asked for my advice, and I gave it without thought. When she was upset, I tried my best to calm her down and express care. When she needed a boost, I gave it to her. She was worth my time. And she did the same for me. Because she was going through a hard time in general, I did all this because she was who she was. Then...we had a couple of fights. Nothing horrible, and we supposedly worked through our problems but...I've been having my own issues recently. After the last fight, where we talked everything out on the phone and she expressed the qualities she liked about me, as a friend, and how she was afraid that doing so in the past had pushed people away...well. Now, she's cold and distant. Not 100%, but there's something sincerely off, enough to notice. Phrasing that you wouldn’t use with a friend, let alone an acquaintance. I have years and years of examples to the contrary and I’ve asked a therapist friend to have a look at the differences as well. She’s definitely changed; it's definitely not just me. Supposedly, she’s looking after her mental health. I can see how having a person there to always reassure them may lead to this person not being as eager or able to rely on themselves, but we could have worked this out. I would have supported them through it. My support was enough up until three weeks ago when something quite major occurred and upset them. Now, I get ‘Well, I suppose that’s very kind of you’ when I express concern for how she is and ‘How do I know that you’re not rolling your eyes?’ when I express that I care and ‘What possible use could I be to you’ when I tried to give her a little advice and express that she's important to me too. These are all usual parts of the conversation and nothing out of the ordinary from my side. Her manner and actions are a huge backflip, because less than a month ago she expressed how important and vital my friendship was to her because she—definitively—knew I cared about her (and suspected others didn’t). She also stated that she was going to be a better friend. Now I hear ‘I need balance in my life’, as if it was a major issue to be close to someone. The two things—better mental health/developing more of an ability to take care of oneself *and* having someone close to confide in—are not mutually exclusive. I’ve lost a decent amount of sleep over this because the support was reciprocal, so it feels like I've lost a large part of my support network. I’m looking for any opinions on what I should do here, because I’m hurting and it’s already been a bad time (of which this person is aware). I've already asked them twice what's up and the question has been turned on me both times, as if I'm the one with the issue. I don't want to cut them off because they really do mean a hell of a lot to me, but is that all I can do here? I've tried to just back way off for the moment and see if they realise what they've done on their own. P.S. This is a six-year friendship. Did not just evolve to being close overnight. ",ged12345.txt

I tried keeping in contact after she graduated by texting her at least once a month etc. but she would hardly ever respond. It seemed as if I was making much more of an effort than she was. When I found out that I wasn’t invited but everyone else in our group was, she hurt me in a way so deeply that she could never understand.

1,"Is this my distorted reality? Okay, I almost always run into this problem with friends, and I'm not sure how to get out of the situation without feeling guilty or ashamed of losing yet another friend. Situation One There's this friend whom I helped many times and every single time other people bashed me, she would either laughed with other people or further ridicule me.  Things like asking me to fix her phone, helping her find a place to rent, providing her with advice on many issues... I have since asked her not to further ridicule me, and her response was, ""oh this is not what I do, but I would like to remain friends with you because you are a resourceful person and you see things differently."" I kind of ghosted her after I graduated from university, but I always wondered whether I handled the situation appropriately.  She always tries to avoid me in public space, but when she gets into a car accident, she would call me and ask for help.  I am neither interested nor in love with her.  I actually felt she might be in a hopeless state, that's why she wanted my help. SCENARIO TWO I have this friend who always makes weird implication towards how stingy I am.  They made assumptions about my contributions to me and my SO and said things like, ""Oh, if given the opportunity, would you kill [so's name] and claim his insurance policy"", ""You know greedy people normally turn out to be the poorest bunch in the population right?"".  The fact is, I have been contributing to the relationship between my SO, my SO is older than me, so in a way, my SO is more financially independent.  At times when SO is helping me out, I always mark the number down so I know how much I owe SO [actually he calculated the amount and sends me invoices].  But I won't disclose such details to my friends.  I am just disappointed as to how people assume things and the last thing I want is to be the victim in every f*ing relationship.

1,"Advice please. Am I in the wrong or is she overreacting? This is going to be a long post! This is my very first post! Me (F33) and, now ex best friend (F33) just had a major falling out and she’s blaming me. Here’s a little backstory; We were best friends, did everything together, babysat each others kids and just hung out all the time.  I have 5 kids, she has 2. My youngest are 19 month twins, her youngest is 9 month old girl. I babysat last for her on Nov 1st. Before dropping her baby off, I always vacuumed because she spent all of her time on the floor. Nothing dangerous in her reach (obviously, I Baby proofed for my kids). She was rolling around and got over by my shoe rack and found something I didn’t see and, like babies do, she stuck it in her mouth. I went over to her and did a finger sweep to remove it but I couldn’t get it and it made her gag; not choke, gag. So I angled her down, patted her back and it fell out. She smiled at me when I turned her right side up, obviously unfazed by what just happened. I stayed calm, and did what needed to be done, no harm. Told mom about it and she seemed unfazed as well and stayed and chatted and left shortly after. Thought everything was fine until just a few nights ago. She sends me a text; that’s right, a text, and basically tells me that I can no longer be trusted to watch her kids and that the state of my house should’ve been a red flag. (My house is lived in, not a pig sty). She said I dropped the ball and let her kid stick something in her mouth and she could’ve choked. Also, I was so nonchalant about telling her about it and that means I was lazy and didn’t see it as a big deal. News flash- it wasn’t a big deal, nothing happened.  She said she wants me to apologize for putting her daughters safety at risk and that basically this friendship is over. I’m sorry but if it’s safe enough for my twins it’s safe enough for her daughter. She found something that I couldn’t see from my view point and stuck it in her mouth. I stayed calm, responded and everything was fine. Should I apologize? Did I do something wrong? She is refusing to talk to me face to face. I don’t feel like I should apologize for something every baby does. I just can’t believe she held onto this for so long. We’ve even hung out since then and she never said anything.

My job has become busier so I've become more exhausted when I get home and I just don't want to do anything. Then on March 4 my brother from my adopted mother died of a heart attack so had to go through that experience with my niece, his only daughter. Then right after that my husband got really sick with pain in his belly.  We took him into emergency and they did a CT scan and could see only massive infection and couldn't tell where it was coming from.  So he was admitted and given antibiotics and scheduled for a colonoscopy. He was also very low on potassium so he was given bags of potassium and taking pills on top of that. His colon was clear so it was determined his gall bladder was diseased and needed to come out.  But right now it was so swollen and infected the surgeon wanted to wait until the infection cleared and swelling went down before he took it out.  So husband is now on a non-fat diet to reduce the swelling and still on antibiotics to clear out the infection. Fortunately, being vegan, non - fat is not too hard for us to do.  He goes in for a pre - exam on Wednesday and then surgery a week later. But through all this I haven't been doing my routing of medications and exercise and am suffering for it.  Fibro and migraines have hit me really hard.  I'm still trying to take care of my husband though by preparing his meals.  He lost almost 30 lbs through the last week of this whole episode.

I've had it for years and it causes weakness in my legs and pins and needles in my feet.  It could also affect bladder and bowel functions but I haven't had that problem yet. I've read that sometimes they cut the end of the spinal cord to get it out of the way of the vertebrae.  I'm not sure how serious my case is but my neurologist thought it was serious enough to send me to surgeons.  It's a rare birth defect I guess found in adults.  Usually they catch it in infants. So, in a LARGE nutshell, that has been what I've been up to ",geekgranny_e_2_c_c3g_us.txt

0,"Difference between antidepressent starting side-effects and hypomania? Hey all, So I've read about how SSRIs can send bipolar people who are misdiagnosed with unipolar depression / anxiety into hypomania or mania. I've also read that SSRIs can have activating effects during the start up period (including insomnia, restlessness, distractibility) that sound similar to some of the symptoms of hypomania. So if someone starting and SSRI experiences trouble sleeping, restlessness, increased energy, increased distractibility, periods of euphoria, spends money like it's nothing, increased pressure to talk/sing/dance, increased responses to music and caffeine, starting up old hobbies, etc.,  how can they know whether it's a combination of start-up side effects of the SSRI + feeling (much) better from the SSRI (or maybe placebo / excitement from doing something about the depression) or an antidepressant-induced hypomanic episode? I know it's a question for a professional but I like to hear experiences also. ",Cityzza.txt

1,"[Need Advice] best friend (21f) moving in with my dad (dad age) and I (21f) My best friend and I have talked about living together plenty of times. Now it’s really happening because her family is moving out of state and she has nowhere to go. My dad and I live in an apartment together and share expenses (though he pays for most of it). It’s a pretty good situation, but there are anxieties we both have about my friend moving in. She is unemployed and has been for a while. The deal was that she could move in once she got a job (the deal was made like 7 months ago), but she is still jobless and her family is leaving in 3 days. We’re letting her move in, and luckily her mom is willing to help out with her expenses until she gets a job. But here are the worries: • She had a lot of time before this to get a job, what if she takes even more time even after she’s moved in? My dad and I know from experience how difficult getting a job can be, but also expected her to have one by now. The thing is, she’s very picky (even when she can’t afford to be). She won’t just take any job, she’s only applying to places she’d prefer to work at. Which I totally get! But at some point you just gotta do something even if you hate it, it won’t last forever and will even help you get to doing something you don’t hate. She’s repeatedly said that she’s “not the kind of person that can work a job she doesn’t like”. And that is definitely making it take longer for her to find work. But what can ya do? • Another thing is, my dad and I (my dad especially) have had not-so-great experiences with friends/acquaintances moving in. That’s definitely made both of us have some not-so-great feelings about this situation (even if it may end up being really good!). A lot of things can ruin this and it’s hard to know how to avoid those things while still being a friend. It’s a thin thin line. • my dad and I (my dad more than me) are also worried about compatibility. My dad and I get along great and it’s been no problem for us to live together. We have an unspoken agreement on bills, chores, privacy, etc. It just works. How can we keep that agreement while including a whole new person who might not think the same way? For instance, I don’t know much about the way she lives. I know how it’s been with her family, but things are different when you leave home. It’s tough to say how it will be, but my dad is worried that she won’t be the kind of clean, kind, generous person he expects a friend/roomie to be. It’s tough because I agree with him.. • there’s the other matter of an official Roommate Agreement that could be made and signed by the 3 of us. We all think it’s a great idea, but I know how things can still get messy (literally and figuratively) when living with a friend. The problems that can arise are endless and maybe some even unavoidable. All we want is for things to work out well, with the least amount of issues as possible. Communication is key and that’s the goal of this Roommate Agreement. However, there is still that line that we do not want to cross. I want this move-in to be professional as well as friendly. How can my dad and I make the rules clear so that she will take them very seriously without this being like some kind of crazy contract? Thanks for even reading this! ",NyaAndersonsLies.txt

1,"I'm having trouble getting along with someone I want to consider a friend Long story short: This guy was originally a friend of a friend, I'll call him Jeff. We all go to the same college and have the same mutual friends. Jeff and I got along pretty well for a bit but recently all he does is piss me off While I get the whole ""friends mess with each other"" idea, but it just doesn't fly with me and this guy. I may mess around with my friends once in a while and I'm a big joker, but for the most part I just like to have a good time together whenever we do anything whether we play video games, go to the gym, etc. On the other hand, it feels that Jeff goes out of the way to piss me off no matter what we do because he KNOWS it will piss me off. I know typically you want to show no reaction to this kind of thing to avoid fanning the flames but I can't help it I don't know how to deal with him or get the message across. When I tried to sit down with him and talk man to man, Jeff didn't seem to take me seriously and kept going ahead with his previous antics. I talked with our other friends (who have known him longer than I) and they all just told me something along the lines of: ""he doesn't mean anything by it, it's just how he is don't get offended"". But unfortunately, we don't mix that way. Now Jeff's not inherently a bad person, when he's serious he's actually a pretty good guy. He has helped me out in some tough binds before and has done so for the other guys too, all of which I greatly appreciate.

We’re different but complimentary personalities and have always gotten along great. (She’s an INFJ Enneagram 1 and I’m an INFP enneagram 4 for reference if you’re into that kind of thing) ANYWAY, we’ve always had an issue (or at least I have) with communication. I love and value conversations with friends. She does too, but when we’re together we rarely have conversation. She doesn’t respond to a lot of my attempts to make conversation (which honestly makes me feel like an idiot, and over the top.) We recently decided to room together and it’s completely exacerbated the silence and my own insecurities. It’s hard for me to continue to update her on my life and ask for updates on hers when the conversation is so strained - and this is my main confidant, best friend in the entire world. I know she values our friendship and cares about me. She’s just quiet. And I’m insecure about that. I just don’t know how to live with the lack of conversation because I feel like there’s a lack of friendship in our quiet apartment.

0,"Hi, I am new here and don't know where to start, where to post or anything. I don't know what can help me, but I know that I don't like my self, and I am unhappy most of the time. I am not currently on any medicines (can't even do that right) and have never really been tested or diagnosed with anything other than depression. I live my life day dreaming of what could be and what should be......I am a 38 year old female and my problems started when I was born. I was born to an alcoholic dad whom I loved and a mom who did the best she could whom I love as well. My whole family was in therapy from about the time I was 4 years old. Our family therapist/doctor was Dr. Love, I am not kidding that was his real name. All kinds of things were going on in my family that I was not aware of until I was grown. One was the fact that my real father was sexually molesting my older half sister.......I was labeled a ""bad child"" ""out of control child"" and was locked in my room for hours at the time which was what our doctor told them to do.....I would not cry when I was punished or spanked and my mom would have to stop my dad from whipping me to keep him from killing me I suppose. I was the youngest of 4 children, 1 real sister 1 half sister and one half brother. Although after I was grown I found out that my real sister was only half too... I was very creative in a strange kind of way while I was locked in my room. I would open my window a scream for help with my tape recorder on, so when I got tired I could play it back so maybe someone would come......we had big metal blinds in the windows and for some reason I would raise the blind all the way up and tie the string to my door knob when I would go to sleep at night so the blind would fall if anyone opened my door... Crazy huh??? Any way, when I was about 11 years old I was put in a foster home, you know cause I was a bad child. Then I went to group homes, back and fourth here and yonder. Never tested for anything.....never medicated.....I was back and fourth from home, foster homes, group homes and mental hospital from the age 11 to 16. During one of the times I was gone my parents divorced, and my mom moved to a new house. I had met a guy during one of my short stays home, and thought that he was my world. You know by then I thought no one loved me, except for him. He was my world. My oldest sister told me that if we got married I couldn't be sent away any more. She knew how it was being at those places in the 70's and 80's....I mean if you weren't already ""mad"" you would be.....So I married the only person in the world that I thought loved me......As soon as we were married, I got pregnant. He cheated on me, controlled me, I couldn't even go outside without him beating me. He would come in from his girlfriend's house and if I said anything about it, he would go off and throw things and call me every name in the book, take aerosol spray cans and a lighter and throw flames at me until I was in the corner begging and crying for him to stop. He beat me in my stomach and said he hoped I lost the baby. He said if I ever left him he would kill me. I had to get stitches over my eye where he busted it. Of course I lied to the doctor.....scared for my life. All of this went on for a year, when my daughter was born he was not even there. His parents had to go get him out of his girlfriends bed....I was young and dumb. I thought that everything would get better now, I mean he was the only one in the world that ""loved"" me. Things got worse and when my daughter was weeks old he got in one of his moods and was beating on me and his grandma. That's who we lived with. He went out in the yard and took an axe to all the cars and his dad came over to stop him. My husband took the baby out of my arms and held her over his head in the street and threatened to drop her......that's the day I left him. His father called the police and had them come get him. Then he called my mom and told her she had better come get me and the baby if she didn't want us dead. He said that he had got my husband locked up for now, but that it was his son and that he did have to go get him out. So my mom came and helped me pack up and leave...... That is the first chapter of my life......it doesn't get any better.....but it does help to tell all on here. I will tell more later. I need to go to sleep for a while and pass some time. Thanks for the chance to just ramble on here. ",missinglife_e_2_a_1_xx.txt
0,"I think I may have been on this forum (it looked different) back in 2002 when I had a major bout with depression and anxiety due to some serious financial worries. I've always been prone to this I guess, but I'm starting to figure out that it's big, nasty life-changes that trigger it. Well, here I go again. This time it's relationship-related. My wife and I are on brink of divorce. I found out almost a year ago that she has been emotionally involved with another man, and was no longer ""in-love"" with me. We somehow muddled through the next several months, even though I found out it was still going on, we kept ""trying"" anyway, and things were still tolerable and ok, I guess. (We still shared same bed, got affectionate, cuddled and even made love). About 3 weeks ago, I discovered that it still had not ended, and they were actually conspiring on getting together in March. Well, all hell broke loose and things got worse than ever. I'm now in a separate room, sleeping on a single bed, and I'm miserable. I resumed Wellbutrin when this all started last spring (I took Wellbutrin for about 9 months when I had my episode in 2002), and have been taking it since. But since this really bad turn of events, I knew I couldn't take it, and to be honest, even before I discovered again, my therapist told me that I need to revisit my doctor and prescriptions because I've got some serious anxiety issues. So now I just started Zoloft (25mg/day) in addition to the Wellbutrin. I don't know how things are going to turn out. I'm in ""limbo"" while I give her ""time and space to figure things out."" The Zoloft I think started to kick in today, but not in a good way. I'm actually feeling MORE depressed when I came in this morning...I almost broke down crying in front of my computer -argh! My mood swings are horrible. All I can think about is going home and crawling into my bed and taking an Ambien, even though I hate that bed and want to be in the big bed with my wife. I almost wish at times that she would just say, ""That's it, we're done"", so I can know what is going on and just move on with my life. I may end up single and lonely anyway, but at least I'll have the opportunity to look for someone else. Right now I feel like a prisoner, being starved of basic human needs, like hugs, touches, affection. (Doesn't that sound lame from a guy???????  ) Well, anyway, here I am....here for the ride....

How imressed they all are by my resilliance. well guess what mother fuckers? it is fake. i am crumbling and you don't even know it or if you do, you don't care enough to say a thing. stay away and SUZY will pop back up like a wilted peace lily getting a much needed drink. i wish i could tell them that i am angry and that they too will understand my life when they watch their husbands die of cancer. watch as the man that you love dies while his baby grows in your belly. i was cheated. i was robbed and i have tried to make the best of it. i have waited for the best...it is alluding me. i just want some understanding, a strong shoulder to lay my head upon so that i can rest. i am tired of holding myself up. i am tired of running the show. i am exhausted and weary. where is my stamina in the form of a human?

0,Need more info about depression and other mental illnesses? I’m currently watching Kati Morton on YouTube and I always recommend her channel to people who wants to know more about depression or how to deal with it esp if you don’t have any therapist. I don’t know her personally at all! Just sharing this cause there are some things that my therapist and I haven’t discussed yet or some coping methods she haven’t mentioned to me that I found very helpful from Kati’s channel.

I cry about everything. I look at pictures of my kids when they were younger and I burst into tears. I have nothing to be depressed about , good wife, good kids ,good job, I don't understand what's going on. This is totally out of my character. Now it's getting to the point to where I don't want to go to work on night shifts because I'm afraid something will happen to them while I'm at work. Also when I have to sleep during the day I have trouble falling to sleep Its like I'm scared to sleep. I have also wake up from a deep sleep with panic attacks, I have learned how to talk myself out of them. Everything is so emotional it's like I'm morning the death of one of my children. Any way its driving me and my wife crazy, Its not all the time it comes and goes, other times I am fine. My wife says I'm so much more loving toward my family when I'm going through this.

1,"FIL &amp; BIL literally make themselves at home when they visit I like my home to look nice when guests come over. Sometimes I’ll have a lightly scented candle on in the bathroom or hallway or I’ll turn on a lamp to light up my entryway. The kitchen is always set buffet style to make it easy for everyone to serve themselves. I always make sure to make my guest bedroom is welcoming. Like fluffy pillows, comfy comforter, extra linens, working tv. You get the idea. Whenever my FIL comes to visit it irks TF out of me when he makes these little adjustments while he’s here. I recently noticed that he’ll blow out the candle in the bathroom. Like WTF?! I know this cause I went in there before and after him once. He’ll also just randomly walk over to turn off my hallway lamp when he’s only been here for like 20 minutes. A few years ago, when he lived with us for a minute he rearranged my guest bedroom AND would rearrange everything around in my kitchen! I’m like wtf, I like my keurig right where it is! Thank you! Another wtf, we have a sectional that sits about 7-8 people comfortably when FIL/Bro IL come over they insist on spreading out and lay across the whole damn thing. Do they offer me a seat when I come over? No. It’s only until my bf scoots over to make room for me so I can squeeze in to sit somewhere at the end of the couch. Oh and bro in law? He always makes sure we know he eats gluten free. FYI he is NOT allergic to gluten and insists that “If the package doesn’t say Gluten Free it’s not gluten free.” Everyone knows not to start that argument with him,  there’s no point. Even if I mention that if my friend who has celiac disease can eat something it’s gluten free. He just shakes his head like idk what I’m talking about.

1,"Is this my fault? I've been on SSI ever since high school but before high school I wasn't. My oldest aunt suggest to me to get SSI but let's call her Cancer Rat because her zodiac sign is a Cancer. I was like ""Nah, I'm good for now"" because I'm lazy I didn't feel like doing that but I didn't tell my aunt that! SO, she took it the wrong way and start yelling BLAH, BLAH THIS and BLAH, BLAH THAT. My mom was like ""Cancer Rat you cannot get mad because she decided not to do that!"" Cancer Rat gotten more mad ""I'm not mad, I was just saying."" I gotten tired of her yelling because she can't get her way. I was like ""Mom, let's just do it so Cancer Rat can shut the FUUUUUCK UP!"" My mom was like ""Ok, let's just do it. Let's get it over with."" The thing is ever since then I was in 3rd or 4th grade the relationship between Cancer Rat and I went down hill! I stopped going to church with is where is start going down hill. She got mad because I stopped going to church with her. From time to time Cancer Rat will bring it up to manipulate me to have me feel guilty about it but I caught on to it. She makes fun of my weight, hair, clothes I wear, what I eat and drink, just everything like she's overdramatic about every fucking thing I do but I'm probably ain't the only one though. It's so bad that I can't even read a story on the Wattpad without her bitch ass accusing me of texting a boy when I wasn't! She probably hates when I play video games. In 2016 she called me mentally retarded and said I don't think straight but I don't know why and if I ask her why she said that to me that she'll just lie, lie, lie of why she said it. She gets overdramatic when she's the last to find out shit or when you stop telling her shit, stop talking to her. I stop telling shit because you'll tell her not to say anything to anyone that she'll do it anyways. She did all of this ever since I was in 3rd or 4th grade and still is til this day.. Now you know my back story with Cancer Rat. Ever since 2014 I started to use Bitcoins and the only person knows I use it is my mom at the time but my brother started to find out and he ended up founding out. From 2014 to 2017 I will lose Bitcoins and wins or earn Bitcoins! Just like if I were to use the trade market, you'll win or lose some. In 2018 I wanted to make history by making thousands of dollars from a $29.00 Bitcoin investment and I did. The problem is that Cancer Rat daughter, let's call her Tuna Fish in her 30's. So I made 2 mil but the household only knew about it. Until I made a big mistake by making a youtube video about my 2 mil and shared the video to my Facebook! The mistake was sharing it to my Facebook page. Here's the thing…Tuna Fish love to lurk on people Facebook pages using her husbands account and I wasnt paying attention until after my aunt Cancer Rat confronted me about my earnings 3 days after I shared the link to my Facebook. Cancer Rat yell and cussed at me that accused me of using SSI money to earn my 2 mil, that I did it behind everyone's back, that I didn't even bother to let her help, that I was being greedy, I didn't even bother to tell her, that she had heard it through someone else how they showed her proof, that the person had showed her a video of it, she's disappointed in me, she will forgive but won't forget, and that she feels lefted out. Here's the thing I did use SSI to get the 2 mil because back in 2015 and 2016 that Cancer Rat b•tch ass sent a letter to them told a false story how I barely go places, that my mom have to do all the work, that I'm mentally retarded, that I rage on video games, other sh•t that I can't remember and one of the update application for SSI that Cancer Rat lied to them and said that I was in a wheel chair when I never was. So that's when I started to think that she might trying to get them to cut me off and thats why I used $29.00 of my SSI money to get the 2 mil as back up like I didn't think it was a big deal. It wasn't my fault to me because I wasn't the one sending letters trying to get someone cut off but my mom told me to not say anything about the letters when we had first found out and today is day to confront Cancer Rat. I had to do it. Now Cancer Rat wants to try and tell me what to do. She says ""Girl, whatever I say to you is for the best. Whatever you did to make that 2 mil that I want you to stop doing it because it's not fair that you made your first 1 mil before your 21st birthday. You didn't do anything specially to get it. I mean like you SAT ON YOUR ASS!"" She was pissed but I don't give a fuck. I said ""I had to do what I gotta do! It's not my fault that it happen. The reason why I turn $29 to 2 mil is because some bitch trying to sabotage my SSI by sending in false letters and I wonder who? Now you're mad because I made 2 mil before my 21st birthday OMG!"" so Cancer Rat yell and cussed at me that she said ""I KNOW YOU USED YOUR FUUUUUCKING SSI MONEY TO EARN THAT 2 MIIIIIILLLLLLLLL AND YOU USED 29 FUUUUUCKING DOLLLLLLARS! YOU DID IT BEHIND EVERYONE'S BAAAAAACK! YOU DIDN'T EVEN FUUUUUCKING BOTHER TO LET ME HELP YOUUUUUUU! YOU WAS BEING GREEEEDY! YOU DIDN'T EVEN FUUUUUCKING TO TELL MEEEEEEEE! I HAD TO HEAR IT THROUGH SOMEONE ELLLLLLLSE! THEY SHOWED ME PROOOOOOF! THEY SHOULD ME A VIDEO OF IIIIIIIIIIIT! I FEEL SO FUUUUUCKING LEFT OUUUUUUUUT! I'M SO DISAPPOINTED IN YOU GIIIIIIIIIIIIRL! I'LL FORGIVE BUT I WON'T FUUUUUCKING FORGET THIS."" After Cancer Rat stopped yelling that I was about to say something but my mom beat me to the punch. My mom said ""Cancer Rat, how is my daughter greeeeedy when you're the only one complaining about the money like she didn't even do anything wrong at all?"" Cancer Rat got so fucking fed up that she stopped her ass out our fucking house and slam our f•cking door but while Cancer Rat and her daughter Tuna Fish was leaving that they shook their fucking heads at me!! Another thing before I started to use Bitcoins that this household was very poor. Trying to make ends meet. Barely trying to keep the food in the house. What made it worse when Cancer Rat and Cancer Rat daughter Tuna Fish (Cancer Rat have 2 other sons but they always in the streets doing who knows what), Cancer Rat grandkids Mices always bragging about money, money, MONEY everytime they come over to our house. ""Look we went and bought this"", ""We went and bought that."", ""We went and spent this much money."", ""We went and spent that much money."" They knew we was poor. So I asked them ""Why everytime y'all come over here that y'all somehow brag about money?"" They was like ""GIIIIIIIRL ain't nobody trying to brag about money. Are you mad that you cant buy video games all the time LMFAO!!""  Always make fun of me about that. June 3rd, 2018 I will be 21 years old. Here's my question about the 2 mil and everything that ➡Is this my fault? Am I in the wrong here because I used $29 of my SSI money to earn my 2 mil, that I did it behind everyone's back apparently, that I didn't even bother to let her help me apparently, that I was being greedy apparently, I didn't even bother to tell her apparently?

Cicero, one of the senators of Rome in the early days of the empire is quoted to have said ""Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others."" I liked waking up early and going to the gym on an intense pre workout. I like stepping outside in the cold to smoke and feel the warmth when I re-enter the building. I like seeing the trees trying to survive the winter, how splendorous they are. In them I see people going through hard times and the beauty that exists within them. I liked logging on to Runescape to escape reality for a couple of hours and talking to my friends on there. The fact that we have escapes is an amazing thing. I liked seeing three girls meet each other outside and say ""Hiiii how are youuuu?"" and compliment each other. Instead of normally being irritated by that, I actually admired that people in reality share bonds and happiness with each other's presence, and it made me happy to see that. I like the complexity of the mathematics that I'm doing and the fact that I'm doing it. I like having a planned meeting with a group of people today for my class presentation in college. I like having a picture of a God who constantly forgives and is deeply saddened by our unhappiness that becomes to hard to bear for some, versus a picture of an angry Colonel with zero mercy.

0,"I have now had BAD night sweats on and off for about 4 years. I am only 32, so it's not menopause and at this point I am pretty sure they are from my antidepressants. I have now tried about 4 - 5 different antidepressants to try to get rid of them but nothing has worked. About 4 years ago I got night sweats when I tried Zoloft which is known for causing them, so I switched to Prozac which never caused them and I was fine, for awhile. Then one day I just started getting night sweats and over the years I tried to get rid of them by switching to Wellbutrin, Effexor, Serzone (I think) and Cymbalta to no avail. My night sweats get worse depending on the season and humidity. At their worst, which as been for the past 2 weeks since the weather change, I am soaked all night, clothing, sheets, pillows, blankets - everything. Then I freeze when I get up to change my clothes or go to the bathroom because I am soaking wet. I am basically at the end of my rope.

1,"Trying to start a dialogue with a friend and seeing it blow up in my face Hi Everyone, First off, thank you to everyone here. I've been a long time reader but never posted. This is yet another post regarding a friend and the problems associated. Basically, me and this guy have been friends since college, we're both in our mid-30s and entering into the next phase of our respective lives. We've always had a contentious friendship, many fights, many core disagreements, and often general dislike for one another. The solution to dealing with this has always been along the line of this: it's R, and he's an asshole, so what can you expect! So the story in question goes like this... we're at a mutual friends wedding and he goes out of his way to ignore me and my gf, now my fiance, coming over to the group we were with and asking a question to a couple people then leaving, also practically walking by us without saying hi. It was only until I said something that he acknowledged us, which set my fiance up in flames. A few weeks later we got engaged and I texted all my friends, including R, individually with a semi copied/pasted message. It was short and sweet, but 100% honest. He doesn't reply, I left the country for vacation, and I never got his text. Turns out he did reply but more on that in a minute. I was upset, I sent him an email that was part deconstructive to our friendship, partly selfish, but also completely honest. I told him my feelings, how I contemplated why he didn't respond but ultimately decided that i didn't care and that I didn't need someone in my life who was going to treat me that way. By telling him these were my feelings and repeating that I wanted him to realize I was upset and I wanted to open a discussion. I never said directly ""I don't want you as a friend"" or ""you're not invited to my wedding"" but that is what he took from it. I wanted to open a dialogue, but he got really upset and angry. Also turns out he did respond to my text, a week later and said that the original text never sent, but that since his wife is pregnant he wouldn't be able to make the wedding, which is completely fine with me because the wedding is in another country. I just hated his response, it was cold and not something a friend should send to another friend regarding a wedding. I called him out and wanted to make him see that by my standards he was not acting like a friend, but also neither was I. I had not put much effort into the friendship either. But I did say that I wanted to say these things rather than say nothing with the hopes that we could find common ground and build a foundation for something to grow in the future, which he completely ignored. I honestly have no idea what to do. I fear he is going to turn all our mutual friends against me, and I don't know how I am able to handle that, or if I can even handle that. My life is in a great place, but my friendships are shit, and that hurts more than I could ever imagine. To put more on top of it, his wife was having issues with a pregnancy, which he said were serious. But I heard from a mutual friend that he said she was fine. So I don't know how to react to that. I honestly don't know where to go from here. My fiance, my rock, my saving grace, is unfortunately traveling for work this month and really crazy busy.

0,"Hi, I'm 19 and new here. I've suffered from acute depression for getting on for 18 months now. I currently take Citalopram, having tried Fluoxetine but it wasn't doing much good for me. I self-harmed on-and-off from the age of 16 to 18 and have been stopped since last June. I recently became engaged (on Boxing Day!) and last month emigrated to live with my fiance. I have previously received some CBT for depression and OCD but that stopped when I went to university in Sept 2005. My mental health deteriorated drastically whilst at university and in December I made the decision to leave. I am hoping that I will soon be able to get some counseling or other sort of psychological therapy here, and to start coming off my medication at some point soon, although I don't want to rush that as I don't want a relapse.

1,"I awoke this morning in a foul mood.  Why??  I don't really know.  I had become a little testy on the phone with my girlfriend last night but not enough to justify it carrying over to the next day.  One thing I do know is it is setting the precedence for the rest of the day, which isn't really surprising as once I get in a foul mood it is extremely hard to pull myself up out of the trenches of self loathing and hatred.  I've been at work for the last 4 hours and have thus far accomplished nothing, at least a lot more nothing then what I usually accomplish while at work.  In recent times I have slipped from a model employee to the try to do as little as possible disgruntle employee, reason being my boss recently hired a new employee and our office is turning into a good ole boys club where I being of the opposite sex feel out of place.  I work at a university and have worked in the same department for the past four years, my official job title is Computer Support Assistant yet my responsibilities have grown much since I started gainful employment here.  Yet now I’m feeling under appreciated as the new guy is getting paid more than me and is perhaps destined, in the near future, for a pay rise, just to stick the knife in a little deeper.    You could argue that his job title carries more clout then mine as he is officially known as a Web Developer, yet I as a lowly old Computer Support Assistant should technically be paid less, yet it appears that I have moved from the illustrious realm of shit kicker to web developer over the years, yet I still kick the shit when ever someone is in.  Technically we should be on an equal playing field, yet this too doesn’t seem to be the case.  Because I have been here the longest I am given the added responsibility of maintaining our servers while my boss lays on a beach somewhere smelling of coconut oil and slowly burning flesh.   But alas it is not to be, I must suffer in silence, I know I’ve not been very silent.  I do however feel much better now after this little venture, perhaps my foul mood was simply due to pent up frustrations which have since subsided as a result of this writing.  I feel better now and perhaps well enough to do some real work. ",3544864.200406040.female.33.txt

0,"it don't get no better than this Last night was a success. I was in truly rare form. My last non-fuzzy memory is of chugging beers at a friend's around 10:30, but highlights of the night include: making out with two of my girl friends; flashing one of my more reserved friends (reaction: ""Did she just flash me??""); waking up this morning with a stranger's cell phone on my desk (a peek through the phone book, and I was pretty sure he's not a law student), but thankfully no owner of the cell phone in my bed; doing way too many shots when, after being asked if I wanted to do shots, I responded, ""I really shouldn't do whiskey shots... Bring me the tequila!"" and apparently a solid effort at drunk dialing, if the outgoing call log on my cell is any indication. We had a really fun night, but then getting shitty with friends is always a good time. I think I was still drunk when I went to Civ Pro this morning, hmm. The bar we went to is dead on Thursday nights (though really packed on Friday and Saturday nights). It was nice, though -- we had the bar to ourselves. About 40 people showed up, and after talking to us for awhile, the owner said he'd give us drink specials on Thursday nights if we came back. He even comped a lot of our drinks, which was cool. We'll definitely be back. I liked this place already, but this is true incentive. A couple people are out tonight, but I lost my steam after Happy Hour.

1,"Was it wrong to block my dad's phone? Was it wrong of me to block my dad? We had a massive fight that just escalated quickly, as we always do. My dad has a habit to threaten to disown me every time he gets angry. Once I pointed out how hurtful it was, and asked him to please not to say that, but nothing changed. So I’m just trying not to respond to these angry text messages about how he wanted me to stop using their address because we are not family anymore. 20 minutes later he sends another message telling me to do as he says or he will embarrass me in an extended family group chat (he doesn’t know that it doesn’t bother me and he eventually carries out this threat later), and then 20 minutes later he offers me a deal where he would drop this address issue if I do a couple of things that he wanted. Sorry for being vague, the things he wanted were the things I essentially didn’t want to do and is linked to what we had an argument about. From my perspective, I saw messages that were intentionally hurtful, about how I wasn’t family, and then I saw a threat to shame me, and then I saw what looks like a way to manipulate or coerce me into doing what he wanted. It was very late at night and I had work the next day. That was the point I blocked his number (and I told him before I blocked it) and it is the first time ever in all 30 years of my life. However, now I’m wondering if it was the right thing to do, because well, Asian parents always say shit like that and don’t mean it, and I think my very drastic step would have upset both my parents a lot. An imposed silence also sabotages the opportunity for future open communication and is quite passive aggressive as well. If they were overreacting about the disowning me part, then I could have angered them to the point where they decide to go through with it. The next two days I unblocked my dad and sent some messages about how I was sorry I had to block my dad and clarified some of the things they were unhappy about (some of what they were unhappy about wasn't at all true). But I think both my parents have now blocked my number. Yet I can't blame them for doing that because I did it to them first, but I do wish I had just turned off my mobile, or been able to bear the burden of hearing shitty talk, instead of blocking my dad. (It's not possible to visit them as we live in different countries). Prior to this fight, I have been working through ‘abandonment’ issues with a therapist. Not hard to understand why… my dad always says things like ‘don’t call me dad’ and ‘don’t come home’, ‘don’t need a daughter like that’ if I don’t do what he says for as long as I can remember. My parents don't know this. I’ve thought about completely cutting my dad out of my life, but I’m undecided as I feel like other people who have done it have more serious issues like abuse, violence, lying, and more about conflicts on serious issues like marriage, religion, sexual identity and child custody. Would really appreciate some 'Asian' perspective here, as most of my friends don't fully understand the cultural aspect of this. ",twentydoggies.txt

1,"Fight! Fight! Fight! Hey Reddit community, I need to know if I’m in the wrong in a certain situation... So a friend and I, lets just call him Kevin, have been good friends for years and have always gotten along (for the most part) pretty well. Earlier this week, though, he was poking fun at me about a certain rumor he had heard about me from a mutual friend of both of ours. The rumor was completely false and out of left field, so much out of left field, that I confronted the mutual friend and asked them what the fuck they were doing. Now, this mutual friend had told my friend Kevin about this rumor and they laughed about it and he made fun of me for it in a pretty brutal, but still jokingly, manner, but decided to drag me in front of the whole squad about it before he asked me whether it was actually true or not. It still bugged me, though, that this mutual friend was talkin shit to who knows who else, spreading this false rumor and whatnot, so I decided to control this mutual friend about the rumor. The mutual friend was surprised that I confronted them about it, and complained to Kevin and thought that it was “weird” that I would confront someone who was spreading false shit about me. Now apparently this mutual friend cut ties with me (I think it’s funny and I wasn’t good enough friends with them to actually care), but Kevin is extremely angry at me and we haven’t talked to each other or about it since, making me think that things will naturally go south.

0,"Hi everybody! I'm new here and I want to tell my story in brief and ask you a few questions. I'm 27 now. Female. I'm studying on PhD in one of the US universities. I've been suffering from different kinds of psychological problems (mainly, depression) for 7 years already. I always tried to handle my depression by myself. And only once, when depression became unbearable, I went to psychiatrist. I had therapy and AD for a few months. That was about 5-51/2 years ago. Now I have strong depression again. I feel that I can't handle it by myself and that I'm tired of fighting it on my own. That's why I've scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist. My questions: 1. I feel that this depression is different from depressions I experienced before :I started to masturbate like crazy (4-5 times a day) and can't stop - it has been like this for a few weeks already and I seriously started to think about involving  in some homosexual relationship (which I've never done before). I also started to read a lot of porno stories. 2. I'm thinking almost constantly about suicide. I mean, I don't think about committing suicide. NO. I WANT TO LIVE. It's kind of obsessive thought playing in my mind: ""I feel bad ...suicide...many people do that...suicide"". It's kind of always in my mind. Sometimes I even have a feeling of the rope on my neck (I don't think about other kinds of suicide which is, probably, explained by the fact that my father hung himself). 3. Where am I going guys? Am I going to some serious psycho disease or what? Am I still normal (I feel like I'm still normal). Have you ever experienced something like this? Honestly, what I'm afraid of is that at some point I might start seriously consider these suicidal thoughts. I think this is what happened to my dad. 4. I've been here, in the US, only for 1 year. So, I don't know how the system works. If I come to a psychiatrist and tell her that I have these ""suicidal"" thoughts will she make me to be in the hospital (I hate even think about this). Should I even tell her about that? Should I be very honest and open? When I went to our University Health Center to get a referral form, I didn't say anything about that. So, I'm a bit afraid of trusting a psychiatrist. Maybe, I don't need to tell her everything. What would be your advice? I'd greatly appreciate your help. Thanks. ",tvk_e_2_b_1_us.txt

I miss having the girl companion, having another girl to talk to about things. But, I don't want a friend that isn't a true friend. Who just dumps 7 years of friendship over feeling like a 3rd wheel.

1,"I News Your advice Hi, I’m 18. my mom passed away three years ago, now  I live with my dad who’s a wonderful dad and I really love him but there’s this situation that I don’t know how to handle : He got involved into a sex club or something like  50 shades of gray, I don’t know exactly what it is but I know that many women send him naked pictures and he is like a master, he tortures them sexually and they accept. I know he’s been involved with that for a long time, even when he was married with my mom, but he doesn’t know I know all that. One day I asked him to answer me sincerely what was that, or just say nothing if he didn’t want to. He lied to me but I said nothing. Today I found by mistake a bag of women underwear with panties in My home I left it open so he’ll know I saw it. Should I confront him ? What should I say ? I’m really scared 😟 ",mariadelmar_00.txt
0,"My Boyfriend Talks Daily About Suicide -- Won't Go To Hospital Hi guys, I'm really just at a loss for what to do. I am absolutely gutted. My boyfriend has pretty serious depression and is in dire need of help. I won't be able to get him in to see a therapist until next week. He has recently become quite down on his luck and he hates himself for it. His anxiety stopped him from going to work, and he was fired. He has a new job now, but he hates it as it is a factory job where he works 60 hrs/week. Any time I try to help him find a new job so he can leave this job, he completely panics and shuts down and I can't say anything or else he yells. It has gotten so bad recently that I dread waking up in the morning because of the psychological warfare with him. He will do things like saying he wants to self-harm, or he is going to jump out of the car while I am driving. I have been with him for years, through thick and thin. I have had to bring him to the hospital before, and he did get better for a few months. He told me tonight he doesn't want me to pick him up from work, and that he wasn't going to come home. At this point I feel completely lost, and I know calling the police won't help. I feel trapped and I need to get out for my own health, but I am deathly terrified he is going to kill himself if I leave. He told me I am the only thing holding him back from killing himself. I'm scared. He is such a good person when he isn't feeling this constant depression. I don't know how to get him to understand we just want to help him. He shuts me down every single day, and it hurts knowing he has given up on himself. What can I do to help him until he can see his therapist next week? I want to leave but I am so scared he will kill himself if I do. ",Blhipes.txt

0,"Reddit Secret Santa Saved My Life... I want to begin this by saying that I've been in a really dark place recently. Combination of family issues, breakup, and finals put me in a really depressive state. As a result, I'd been having strong suicidal thoughts for weeks. I had been seriously thinking about ending my own life. So that's the context in which this occurs. About a month ago I signed up for secret santa on a whim. I had never done it before and honestly didn't expect anything. But yesterday, my gift arrived. I don't know who this person is, but they spent at least $150 dollars on about 6 separate gifts. They also included a really thoughtful and touching letter that talked about how they thought I was such a great person and how much they enjoyed learning about me. I immediately broke down crying upon reading it. It might seem small or sorta stupid, but it made me feel like someone cared about me. That I wasn't the idiotic nobody my depression tells me I am all of the time. I felt motivated and happy for the first time in weeks. I cleaned my room and did work that I'd been ignoring for months. I finally felt like maybe, just maybe, I meant something. It changed my life, and probably saved it. So whoever you are, thank you so much, and I can't express how much this meant to me or thank you enough. And let this be a lesson to everyone else. The smallest act can and does make a difference. Let's all try and use the Christmas season to ensure everyone feels a little more loved. ",throwawaychristmas-y.txt
0,"The world needs more ""lollipop moments"". Back in middle school, I was helping out at a sunday school, tutoring primary kids. There was this adorable little girl who was struggling to sing the right tunes of a hymn. Even though I have absolutely no musical background, I tried to help her get her vocals and lyrics right by singing the hymn together. Eventually, I told her to continue repeating it herself and that every practice is an improvement from the last. She would call me frequently just to sing her new hymns and I would challenge her to learn a new hymn every week, this routine went on for quite a while between ourselves... Fast forward to today, I'm currently a struggling undergrad students coping with depression and stress and well as deteriorating health due to extreme fatigue. Bad grades and crippling financial debt are the least of my concerns. Many days I would feel tired and unmotivated to do anything... and barely making it to lectures only to zone off. At days I would think of suicide as well. There was nobody I could turn to that I felt I could relate to or even understand me... It was not until a few days ago I received an email from the girl's mother, the girl was unfortunately diagnosed with an illness that made her lose up to 90% of her hearing. However, she was recently accepted to a prestigious musical academy, and sent me the audition tape of her performance thanking me for my encouragement. That song that she performed, was the very first hymn she struggled when I first came up to her. Knowing that the girl went through so much hardship just to chase the dream I stimulated her from her youth gave me so much hope at the darkest point of my life. Knowing that I had the capacity to influence a big change in a little girls life gave me the purpose to live. Even though I had to wait for 8 years for this news, it was worth it. TL;DR We all have the ability to give small act of kindness which goes a long way.

0,"First of all, a happy Christmas to one and all. My situation is that I have had moderate depression on and off since 18 years old, and 2 years ago aged 33 I had it so bad I had to be off work for 3 months. Then I tried the SSRI Escitalopram and it worked perfectly and I went back to work. I came off it a year ago and then 4 months ago I suffered a relapse and had to go back on it, and now I am OK (except when it came back for 3 days after a booze bender). My psychiatrist is saying I should take them indefinitely. As I have no side effects I am happy with this, but I am concerned about some reports saying that they start to work less well after some years. Is this right. And if so wouldn't it be better to ration them so I only take them after I relapse? So they keep on working for longer, if not the rest of my life. Is there anyone on the boards here who has been taking antidepressants for many years who has found they have become less effective and now regrets having taken them for that reason. And now suffers depression that now cannot be treated by medication? Yes I've heard that you can switch to others, but surely the same type of reasoning applies? The psychiatrist said that I had endogenous depression with a reactive cause, and that she didn't think that counseling would help. Does this make sense? A former work colleague of mine recently said that the antidepressants had made me start acting ""weird"". Well apart from posting on an internet forum I don't think I've done anything weird, and other friends agree with me. But other friends all think that it is not good for you to keep taking these ""happy pills"" for a long term, that antidepressants are a short term fix only. But what do they know.

I am also trying to care for an ill family member who just got out of the hospital and had major surgery (takes a year to recover from this surgery). This family member is pretty much bedridden and needs to be bathed, fed, and cared for much the way a private duty nurse would. It is a daunting task for me under the circumstances. Insurance will not pay for long term care and we cannot afford even the cheapest of help. Hence, I am managing all of it alone. Once in a blue moon, my in-laws will help but are very resentful on the rare occasion that I ask for help.

1,"Help with/what to do about toxic sister? (Sorry for sloppy wall and if this isn't the right thread) As the title says I don't know what to do about my 29 year old sister. She is known by the family to be immature, selfish, and impulsive. She repeatedly burns bridges with family when she does not get her way and will give them the short end of a deal if it benefits her (ie. Not paying my financially struggling mother back on the multiple occasions of covering her rent or car payment because she decided to use her paycheck on a new TV or $200 purse). I'd love to not speak to her and never go to her place but because she is the mother of my 2 year old niece this is not possible. To give you some perspective, she has fights with my niece's father who got their old apartment raided by the police for selling heroin (finding heroin and a pistol in a safe in the apartment) to the point of yelling and hitting, even late at night when the child should be asleep, right in front of my niece. Because her father is soon going on trial and to prison for a long time (ex convict in possession of a firearm on top of selling heroin) and as previously stated, my sister being a half-assed parent, I am left to clean up after her when it comes to my niece. I have to be consistent in teaching her not to hit people and not to spit at them. Again, to give you some perspective, I am 15 years old and do not need the stress of making sure a child grows up to be a decent person on my plate. My sister has multiple DUI and assault charges which have resulted in her drivers license being revoked yet she continues to drive with my niece in the car even when everyone who knows her and cares about the child tells her not to. Although she is better now she is still a complete ass of a parent with her first kid dying before the age of one and losing custody of her two other sons about 9 years ago (older one being 13 and the other being 9). I am actually convinced her uterus is hexed because every time she has a kid shit goes horribly south which makes me terrified in the case of my niece. In the winter of 2016 my sister attempted suicide (my niece being just under 1) and while her drug dealer boyfriend screamed at her while she laid on the floor saying she wanted to die I had to make sure the child was still sleeping through all of it in the next room. Now although few and far apart, I've had my struggles with depression so I understand how difficult postpartum depression can be but even then I believe as a parent you always put the child first in every scenario. On top of everything else she completely spoils my niece buying her an unnecessary amount of toys and candy whenever she reaches for it at the store and I know she is not going to be able to handle it when my niece wants something at the mall my sister absolutely cannot afford at the moment and her entire worldview changes when she realizes she does not get everything she wants when she wants it. Although I mostly enjoy being alone and I have never been in a relationship I can only imagine possible significant others would not be totally understanding when I try to explain that my niece comes first which only adds to the stress and worry. To be clear, my sister is not neglectful and provides for my niece with everything a child needs such as diapers, food, bed, cleaning, etc. but if she continues this way (which I know she will) my niece will grow up with the same characteristics as my sister and it's just about all up to me to make sure that doesn't happen.

0,"I'm sort of new... Here is the short version: I'm 26 year old man. Single. No kids. I live in Arizona (USA). My father was a workaholic, and an alcoholic. So usually he wasn't present, and when he was he was abusive. In addition, mental illness runs in my family. At the age of 5 I was sexually molested by a neighbor. I can recall my anxiety always being there. It's something I have always fought with especially in social situations. My family completely isolated me when I was growing up, in the name of protecting me. As a result I never really learned social skills until I was older. I grew up being abused by my peers throughout school. Found myself taken in by the only people who would accept me as I was: the misfits, outcasts, drug-users. Early into my teen years depression came as an addition to my anxiety. Around 16 I started to get into substance abuse. The only thing I ever used was LSD on weekends regularly. A year later this extended into ecstasy and LSD. I had a traumatic experience and stopped using anything about a year after that. My anxiety became so overwhelming I could not function. So at this time I first started seeing a counselor and a psychiatrist. They put me on Clonzepam. My last year in high school my father was starting to lose it so my mother asked me to leave so we didn't kill each other. I had an inheritance from another relative and I lived off that. I went 2 whole years without speaking to my father. I sunk deep into depression, and returned to substance abuse. The Clonzepam wasn't working anymore. After being outcast from my family, I went full on into the dark side. What was just LSD and ecstasy usage branched into cocaine, meth, marijuana, and virtually anything my friends and I could find. This culminated in an extreme suicide attempt about a year out of high school. After getting out of the mental hospital, I went totally straight and haven't touched any drugs since then. The 8 years following have been a rollercoaster. One moment being on top of the world, having everything I could ever want. Another losing everything. Several long horrible relationships occurred in this time. Over the years my doctor has moved me around on various medicines. I have been using Effexor since 1998. Currenlty I take Lamictal in addition to it. I suffer from chronic reoccurring depression, social phobia, and generalized anxiety disorder. ",twistedemotions_e_1_b_1_xx.txt

She showed me the envelope and it wasn't scanned at all. She also said that the mail had already come in the office and the envelope was in her mailbox way after she had already checked her mail. So, we have no idea how that got to her office. But I don't drive and Carol didn't take me anywhere last week. So, if anyone remembers being with me or talking to me Tuesday...COULD YOU HELP ME OUT PLEASE. My therapist looked over the information that I sent her and she said that everything basically fits with what I'm going through and DID. The problem is, she doesn't treat dissociative disorders and has no idea how to even help me. I appreciated her honesty though. But she said she knows a therapist in Jeffersonville, IN...oh God...that treats dissociative patients but I don't drive and Carol's not going to take me over to Jville on a weekly basis for therapy. Also, we've never even been over there before so we'd get lost. So, she then called her boss and another lady to see if they knew who else in Louisville could help me and to see if she can get some help on treating me. I also gave her more info on some of the things I'm dealing with and the voices that are going on. I even gave her the names of the two that I already know of. She said the fact that I can't remember my childhood and that I not only lose time for minutes but also for days that it isn't normal and we need to figure out how to help me. I've been in the mental health system since 2001 and have had just about every diagnosis slapped on me. I hope I can finally get some help. I'm honestly about to give up. She also said that she's going to see if they can take me off the Seroquel since it's making me sick and NOT WORKING. So, she asked me what else I've been on and I told her (Haldol - didn't work, Risperdal - didn't work, Zyprexa - didn't work, Paxil/Paxil CR - worked for a little bit then wore off, Wellbutrin - didn't work). She said that she wants to try Depakote, Abilify, or another mood stabilizer. I also took those two journal entries in that I posted last week so she could read them. And, I wish I could get it scanned but it didn't look right to me so I can't show them to you (that's why I just typed it) and she said that one of the interesting things that stood out about the entries is that the handwriting was different in three places. I'm a mess. But believe it or not, after today's session I am a little hopeful. In other news, Carol and I have started working on our book of poetry. We've been throwing around ideas all day and working out some details. We're in the process of getting the poems we want to be in the book together and coming up with a title (which we have already done). We're also working on the different categories that we want the poems to fall under. I've been working around with PagePlus for a couple of hours now trying to figure out how we can set this up. She also has a list of publishers that we're going to be going through as well. I'm also still working on getting around to doing some updates on my webpage and trying to budget out how I can pay for my site so I can get more space and get rid of those damn banner ads. I'm moving as fast as I can but right now I'm having some sinus issues (again). ",woundeddove_e_2_b_1_us.txt
0,"Where to start.... Well, I guess I'm here because I think I have depression. I did recently talk to a therapist about it a couple of weeks ago. I guess it did some good because I feel like I may have gotten to the root of my problems. She told me that I was depressed and that I have probably had a low grade depression for most of my life. I kind of thought that I was depressed, because when I would read an article about depression with 10 yes or no questions I would usually answer yes to nine of them. The original reason my wife and I went to a counselor in the first place was because my wife was mad about my occasional habit of looking at pornography on the internet. I understand this bothers her and I do not want to do anything that will upset her. I could never give her an acceptable reason why I did it. I really do not know why myself. I do not think that I have an addiction to sex. It does not dominate my thoughts or life by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, I think that I am pretty ""tame"" compared to most males. Anyway, this causes a lot of strife in my marriage because my wife considers this cheating on her. Well, back to depression. We got to talking about this in counseling and the counselor asked me if I'd ever been molested before. Oh boy. Well, this has always been the big secret part of my life. When I was 6 or 7 years, a female cousin of mine, who was about 4 years older, played some ""touching"" games with me over the course of 2 summers. It was all just touching, but I knew it was wrong. She would tell me that I could never tell anyone because I would get in trouble. So I didn't, until that therapy session. No, I had never told my wife because I always felt embarrassed and like I was to blame because I did not do anything to stop my cousin. I pretty much told the therapist (and my wife of course), everything that had happened to me. I got REALLY upset and probably cried more than anytime in my adult life. I felt somewhat better after talking, but inside I still feel ashamed and responsible for it. The counselor said that because of those incidences, I have had a low grade depression all these years because of holding it all in. I have ALWAYS had a hard time expressing my feelings about anything to anyone. That's just me. I told the therapist that I could see the low grade depression in my day to day life, but there are times when I feel like there is a huge, massive black cloud on me. I can be doing just about anything when suddenly I have this overwhelming feeling of dread and emptiness. There are times that I feel like if I could wish for my own death at that instant, I would gladly do it. When I don't have those bad lows, I just feel numb. The therapist said I might want to try medication, but I already take two different things for chronic physical conditions, and I really do not want to take anymore drugs. I don't like doing anything that I used to do; reading, sports, movies, etc. I have a teenaged son who is just terrific. He is extremely intelligent and just a great kid. I do not want my ""condition"" affecting him anymore than it already has. My wife is sometimes supportive, but I think she is tired of my moods. I have not had the porn problems any longer and I feel like I have gotten past that. (The therapist attributed those times of porn weakness to depression and looking for a way out). I feel like since the counseling sessions that the low grade depression has gotten worse. I am glad that I talked about the things that happened and how I've felt, but I really do feel worse than before. Is there anything I can do besides more drugs? I just don't think those are the answer. Maybe I'm wrong. I don't know. ",delmus_e_1_b_1_xx.txt

0,"I feel really bad for not coming to the forum much last week. i have been in turmoil. Things at home are not going well at all. My husband got his new house and is moving in the next few weeks ... incidentally that is not the problem. I am happy that he is leaving. He has been a real jerk lately. He says mean things to me and he is angry all of the time. He has been working on the road for the past month so we only have to tolerate each other on the weekends  - thank goodness. When he comes home the first thing that he does is go up to the computer room and say hi to his buddies ... not to me and not to our son (in fact he only spend a total of one hour with our son on the weekends). When he finally graces us with his presence he just complains. I did SO much work around the house last week - I cut the grass, weeded the garden, watered the lawn everyday, vacuumed the house from top to bottom, washed the floors on the main floor of the house, did all of the laundry, patched some dents in the walls and painted them, cleaned out our son's room .... and still he managed to find things that were 'wrong'. He even had the audacity to tell me that I am a pig and nothing gets done around here. I just can't take it anymore. All he does is get angry and complain. I finally realized this weekend that I am not his problem. He is just using me as an excuse. I have tried to talk to him and all he wants to do is play the blame game. We have agreed to not see each other for the month of august so that each of us can decide what it is that we want to do regarding our relationship. Even that ticked him off. When I asked him if he would like me to send our son with his parents when they come to visit him he got mad that I wasn't going to come see him. The 'no seeing each other in August' was entirely his idea. I have no clue what is going on in his head. I have tried and tried to talk to him and the only reply I get is defensive or aggressive. I am at my wits' end and am about to give up. I care very much for him and I know that there is something wrong but I cannot help him. I am so afraid of giving up on us though because I am riddled with the 'what ifs'. I want a family so bad. am I settling though? I hate saying that because my husband is not a terrible man. He has his finer qualities it is just that lately they are few and far between. He has even told me that he would cheat on me if given the chance. And that he might have while drunk one night and that the girl has told other people that the baby she is carrying might be his. You know the more that I write the more I feel like an idiot. What a fucking doormat. What the hell am I doing? i am putting my happiness and wellbeing on the back burner for someone who has told me repeatedly that he no longer loves me and thinks that he has had an affair (or at the least would like to). How pathetic can you get. What a glutton for punishment I am. Why is it that I feel that he is more important than me? You know I thought that I was doing better on the medication - I might not be having the emotional outbursts but I still have the low - or should I say non-existent self esteem. If only all of this could be over. If only he could either WAKE up and figure out what he wants to do or just fuck off and never see me or our son again. That would make my life so much easier. I fear for my son. I do not want my husband's anger to hurt our son. I don't want husband to take out his frustrations on a two year old. I worry about sending our son to visit him. Without me there or the dogs, xxxx is the only one there to take the abuse. Anyway that is what I have been dealing with the past week. As a result of all of this I have been on a self destruct mode. I have not been sleeping, i have been late for work and I have been unprepared many times. I am glad that the last day is this Thursday. i will have a month to 'detox'. I need it.

0,"I'm new to this board. I've been on State Disability for severe depression since March. Sometime during the summer - can't remember exactly when - I was sent for a psychiatric evaluation. Even though I told the doctor I was still suicidal, sleeping 18 hours or not at all, bulimic, and in danger of eviction because I couldn't manage running a household, she determined I was well enough to go back to work. I have been under psychiatric care for depression for about 12 years now. This is NOT going away. I have been trying to finish my Social Security application since March but it's too overwhelming. I should have it ready this week. Does anyone have any experience with appeals at the state (California) level?

The pure energy that just flowed off of the stage and into every soul jamming at the concert was so intense. I really didn't expect much from the other bands that I saw, basically because I knew nothing of their musical endeavors. But I would have to say that Flogging Molly and Billy Talent really left a good impression on me. So good in fact that I decieded to download their music. Illegaly of course. It was the only way I could really show my appreciation towards them. Other than not being able to hear for most of the day, it went by pretty typical.

I'm 23, so still young, but I really wish I could go back and be 19/20 again because that was when I was truly happy.

I loved life, I had so much energy and such a bright outlook on everything and I had a lot of fun. Now, that's all over. I really only have one good friend left from those times and he doesn't even live near me anymore; sometimes I get really down when I think about old friends and start thinking about things I could've said differently that might've prevented the arguments we had that would eventually lead to the end of our friendship, I really never knew how much I needed them until they no longer wanted me in their lives. My relationship fizzled out in the same way and I've yet to develop a connection like that with anyone again. I've also gained all my weight back and can't stand to look at my own reflection.

1,"How do I reconcile with a failed friendship from the past Earlier this year, I met a Colombian woman in my state and failed at my attempts to date her; many of our disagreements surrounded my personal history of morbid obesity.  Although I am 5'9'' and now weight around 240 lbs, I have weighed nearly 400 lbs as a teenager and young adult. We dined together and talked to each other for around two weeks.  Within that timeframe, I became very disaffected by her constant criticisms of other men she dated, such as her issues with their hygiene, lack of direction, etc.  After talking to her nearly everyday, she suddenly asked me ""Do you think we're dating?... I think we can only be friends.""  I immediately parted ways with her, informed her of my thoughts on her demanding and emotionally draining ways, very bluntly told her that I didn't like her, and directed her to no longer communicate with me. After another two weeks, she texted me out of the blue and said she ""understood"" my anger, asked to reconnect saying that she though I was a ""beautiful"" person, and eventually informed me that her ""biggest concern was my weight.""  After another month, we went out (with me spending money for gas, etc.) and explored multiple regions in my state.  She kept encouraging me to lose weight and gave me a diet book.  Within the last times we spoke, she confided in me that she was an undocumented immigrant and told me - in anguished tears - about a failed marriage here in the U.S., as well as unwanted sexual encounters she faced here.   I offered my help, but she declined any of my attempts to reconcile her immigration status.  After another week, I became very depressed about not meeting specific weight targets.  I eventually broke down, said I felt ""less than human,"" and asked if we could postpone any further in-person meetings until I could lose enough weight.  Over the weekend, she ignored my texts; I drove to her home to see if she was okay and noticed her car was parked outside. She eventually texted me, saying that I was a person with ""unfriendly attitudes"" sometimes.  Later in the day, she told me that hearing me talk of my weight was tiring.  I was so baffled I couldn't get out a response.  After that, she told me that  I am ""too sensitive,"" looked at the criticism as an insult, and then mockingly told me ""everything hurts you, everything affects you.""  I told her that ignoring me was inherently wrong and hung up.  She then gave me a long text ending that I should ""just be happy... happiness isn't just about body image."" I need advice on how to handle situations like this.  My gut reaction was to tell her she was a ""selfish bitch"" and hang up the phone.  Looking back, that's probably what I needed to do, because that's exactly what I was thinking at the time. Secondly, I need to really reevaluate a relationship with a therapist who told me that cutting her off the first time I did was the wrong thing to do.   I am holding a serious grudge against him, particularly as I don't trust him anymore. In sum, I am unhappy in life - because of shit like this.  I try to be a good person and deal with human turds.  But I need to be strong enough to break out of it rather than be a victim. ",ulisesheureaux.txt

0,"Hi, after 2 posts on the DF I'm finally beginning to work out the format. Excuse the typo's as going through Prozac withdrawals and kind of shaky! I'm 27 years old, I live in the UK, Studied psychology, trained psychiatric nurse, behavior family therapist, and trainee CB therapist. Not sure if I can go back to my CBT course as I have missed so much time from university due to my current episode. This is my worst episode ever. I have had depression for 8 years, and have been ashamed and embarrassed by it. As my life seems to be ebbing away, I have come out with it and seeking psychiatric help. My problem has been that I work in psychiatry and have feared loosing my job/career. It means everything to me. It's the only thing I have and couldn't bare seeing it go down the toilet. Friends don't understand and know how to discuss the topic with me. My family doesn't know as it would devastate an already broken family. For 8 years I've suffered in silence, cried silent screams, been tormented by my own brain. I hate imagining living a life like this especially when the long term effects I'm reminded of every day (my patients). The only person I had was my ex girlfriend, we split last year. CAUSE? me. Stress got the better of me, my thinking became screwed and I've lost her, for life. She was the only one I could talk to, some one I had known for, 12 odd years. Depression has ruined my life. This episode has been an eye opener. This is the first time planet earth is hearing about my struggle. Something, which may have otherwise been lost. My secrets buried with me. Don't confuse this as a suicide note. It isn't. It's me talking about things in this way for the first time. I'm over the crisis point but nowhere near my usual self and need to sort my medicines out with my doctor as soon as possible. I've had a brave chat with my boss who is going to sort out a psychiatrist in the next 10 days, all being well. I have only taken one OD in 1998 with a serious intent to kill myself. Doctors said I survived as I woke up. For years I've avoided talking about it, never wanted to see a psychiatrist but realize now (well for now) that there is 2 people inside me. One is me, the other is depression and to stand the best chance of staying well and keeping well then I need to face I have a problem. Around 3 weeks ago I was so actively suicidal, I was thinking of jumping off a bridge into the river, i searched the internet for ways to kill myself. I'm out of that acute phase but don't trust myself. I have tried SSRIs but they just don't agree with me so it looks like I'm going back on Mirtazapine. I stopped taking it sometime ago as I put on weight. Since last year I've lost 2 stone through diet and exercise. In the last 3 weeks I've lost 4 lbs as a result of depression. Right now my mind's blank. I've never chatted to anyone on this forum before but I know you guys know what I'm going through. My life has never been the same since 1998. It never will be. My dad died in 2002 since then things have worsened. I have so much to say I could write on but going to leave it for now. You guys are the first to hear my full (well pretty full) story. I have never had the courage to speak like this before. Bye for now ",asianmulder_e_1_b_1_uk.txt

I fail at everything and turn everyone down mostly because I was tormented for years by the absurdity of it all. I don't care if me dying will affect anyone. Someone's ""recovery from depression"" doesn't concern me neither. We're just complex preprogrammed machines creating illusions to survive and reproduce, to seek pleasure according to the program.

It's hard to enter the english rock market, cos nevertheless, white skins hate the yellow skinned, thus therefore they will definitely not support.

0,"Am I Depressed or is it something else? This seems like a dumb question because to an extent I know I'm depressed but not to a clinical level. Like I hate the situation I'm in. I hate being in debt. I hate living where I live. That sort of thing. However, I'm not unmotivated. Like at all. I'm not hopeless. I'm not suicidal in any way. I'm terrified of death in fact one of my biggest fears is that I'll get so depressed that I'll become suicidal which is weird, I know but the point is, nothing in me wants to die. That being said, I'm tired all the time. I mean physically exhausted. Which seems to contradict major depression. I get up every day, shower every day, though I don't really want to go to work I go to work and do work with no issue (it's more that I don't enjoy my job that much on most days honestly some days it's super fun it's just one of those things it really has to do with the fact that I'm older and I'm not doing what I thought I'd be doing by this point in my life more than I hate my job). I can't think of many reasons why I'd be this physically exhausted all the time. Literally every doctor says ""You you are just massively depressed"". No, I don't believe I'm depressed to the degree that it makes me physically exhausted. If I still have plenty of hope for the future, want to get up, want to get dressed, want to shower, want to look good...how is this major depression to a point where I'm also tired all the time? Is it possible to have some major depressive disorder and not be hopeless and still be motivated to work hard and try new things? Because if it is, someone needs to tell me that. Any time a doctor tells me I must be depressed if I'm so tired all the time and I tell them that I'm not hopeless or suicidal or unmotivated then they go, ""Oh well I don't know what it is then"". I'm very annoyed with this because I never used to be physically exhausted like this before and doctors seem to just dismiss it as depression when I'm positive my depression isn't so bad it's ONLY making my physically exhausted and not having any other emotional affect on me. I'm frustrated so, if anyone can answer this it'd be helpful so I can see what avenue to pursue next.

It was the first time my friends were introduced to him. My girlfriends went on and on about how hot he was.

I just dont know if I want a man in my life. I've developed this weird fear of men when it comes to intimacy.

1,"What's wrong with my dad and what should I do about him? (sorry for the long post) I wasn't sure where to post this, so I just put it under r/family. A bit of background info: My parents have been divorced since I was 4. For as long as I can remember, my dad's been threatening the things I like to keep me in line. When I was 5 or 6, I had a pet bird that he often threatened to kill or release into the wild if I didn't play the piano. These days, he threatens to sell my phone and my computer (which he knows I need for homework) when I don't attend swim practice at a club I've been going to for years. He's also tried to use me to threaten my mom by refusing to pay for my braces (which cost about $5000) because her arthritis has been preventing her from taking me to swim practice. Not to mention she's unemployed. He's also said some pretty hurtful things about both of us when he's gotten mad. He called me egotistic and has told me a couple of times that he no longer looks forward to picking me up from my mom's house, and he's called my mom negative and accused her of not putting in the effort to give me a good childhood. He often tries to guilt-trip me when I piss him off, usually by telling me about how much effort he puts into raising me and how he does everything while I waste my time on my computer. There was a point back in 6th and 7th grade when he was pretty much a textbook case of emotional abuse, but he's improved since then and it gave me hope that he'd stop the threats and angry rants. Also, he rarely goes through with his threats, although that doesn't make them any less hurtful. Besides the threats and somewhat frequent outbursts, he's a generally normal parent. I can get my mom to file for a full transfer of custody, but I'm afraid she can't handle the financial burden of having me full-time. I'm also a little suspicious of her because I remember her hitting me before my parents divorced, even though she denies it. However, she's a much better parent than my dad right now. So my questions are: Should I consider my dad abusive? Should I take action? ",ZealousidealOpinion.txt

1,"My mom showed heavy favoritism to sister, and i deeply resent both of them. So, i'm 20. I’m a pretty happy, go lucky person, but whenever i think back to my childhood i instantly get depressed and cannot function. This has been haunting me for years, and i'd love to get it out in the open. But, i would like it if someone could read this and tell me, if i have legit reason to be upset about this, or if i'm overreacting? So, in my first 6 years, i was a normal, happy kid. I had a warm, happy family. My parents were just normal, i was a little spoiled, but when your the first born, that's kind of a given, right? But that all changed when i was 5, my mom announced she was pregnant. with another baby. At first, i was happy, i knew what was happening, since i saw it on tv before. Mom still had time for me, of course that all changed when i was 6. I was in 1st grade when she was born. Until she was born, my parents spent literally all their time with me. Here is when the bs started. . So, to start was her actual birth itself. It was a saturday, mom went into labor. I was in my bedroom, playing a video game. Then, during the middle of my game, i heard tires squealing, i looked out my window and saw the family car speeding off. They forgot me, i at first thought they were rushing to the corner store, since mom had some bizarre cravings, mostly for their pizza. But hours went by, i started to worry, and after almost 6 HOURS, someone came to the house to get me (my grandmother). I was kind of peeved, but my dad promised to get me ice cream, so all was settled. So, next was the sleeping arrangement. Every night, i slept right between my parents. I never slept alone, they tried to ween me, but i wasn't particularly fond of my bed. I liked sleeping with them, because it was warm, and i've always had this ""thing"", where i have to run my fingers through someone's hair before sleeping, i kind of grew out of it, forcefully. How? Well, i never got to share a bed with mom again, me and my dad were regulated to the guest room. Mostly because i didn't sleep alone (i never started until i was about 12). Every night after that, my mom took my sister into my spot, she said she'd come get me to come in her bed after my sister fell asleep, but guess what? She never did. Not once did i sleep with mom ever again. We later moved in with my grandma, who only had 2 rooms. I slept with mom and sis every night, and she always pryed and forced herself between me and mom. Come to think of it, mom never really had time for me any more, i had to start taking the bus to school. since she had no babysitter, plus dad worked. I kind of always prefered mom, to my dad. She was a lot more fun, and creative. She made me a marble box out of popsicle sticks once. But, she kind of pawned me off on my dad after the devil child was born. Sadly, when i was 7, my parents divorced and me, my sister, and my mom lived with my grandma. Now, when i was 9, i had gotten involved in 4-h. I had a talent for writing and giving speeches. So, it was a big deal for me. I was the best in my class, and even made it to county competition. One of only 5 kids in my school. It was my proudest moment, since i always sucked at sports. So, we got to the place, there were 50 people listening to me give my speech, i had my little suit, and was very proud of myself. I practiced hours a day, i wanted to go to state as well. And as soon as i get to the podium, guess who starts crying. Loud enough that everyone can hear it. My sister. So, mom had to take her out. She never saw my speech. I gave it, but i just couldn't do it right, i was on the verge of crying myself from what happened. I was too upset that she was missing it, i got a ""Participant"" ribbon, my big moment was ruined. I was gonna do it again next year, but when i wrote my speech, i had no enthusiasm for the project, and it lacked the ""zing"" the previous one had, so i didn't advance very far. I honestly didn't care anymore, mom asked about it, I told her my sister would probably ruin it. She started growing up, and became an even more entitled little tyrant. Here we start on her as a tween. She just got so much worse. First of all, mom really only paid attention to her. She never came in my room to come visit, at all. That's a general example, here is a more specific list. First of all, there was one time that my pants had a hole, the pocket ripped and my wallet fell out, and I never noticed until the next day. She found it, and instead of returning it, she took $100 out of it, then returned it the next day. Worst of all, she told mom to promise not to tell me that she took it, she bought a cell phone with it. I didn't even find out until almost 10 years later. Anytime I would try to spend time with mom, she'd always come in. I never got alone time with my mom, without her rearing her head. That was if I even got to spend time with her at all. She'd promise to spend time with me, but I’d either wait forever, and I’d be too tired to do anything. Or, she'd never show up at all. One time, it was about 8, I asked if she wanted to play Tetris. She said she'd love to, in a few minutes. So, I loaded up Tetris, paused it and waited. Keep in mind, I couldn't really do anything else. It was nearly 2 and a half hours. She never showed, so I went to bed, I could hardly hold my eyes open. She finally did show, she got mad and said ""I thought you wanted to play?"" But, I told her ""I couldn't wait forever."" Her excuse was that she had to wait for my sister to go to bed, because I’d get mad if she came to play too. Instead of saying ""No, I want some quality time with my son"", she just waited till absurd hours of the night, knowing I’d be too tired to play. That was how it was any time I wanted to play with mom. Minor story, I got a bop it toy for Christmas. She asked to borrow it and take it to school, she had to write her name on it so if it got lost, the school would know who it belonged too. She never gave it back, and about 2 weeks, her and mom were playing with it, I asked if I could have it back, and she said it was hers. I never saw it again. One time, she broke my tv. She got the day off from school, faking being sick (I’ll get to that in a moment). While at school, she lounged around my room all day, and somehow broke my tv. I have no clue how, but it's just when I got home it was broken. She never got yelled at or punished whatsoever. The time I got the flu. All night I had been chilled, shivering, and sick. I felt awful, I told my grandma, and she let me take the day off and would take to the doctor's office that day. That morning, I got yelled at, accused for playing hooky. I got took to the doctor, and guess what? I was diagnosed with the flu. Mom changed her tone, and acted nice and as if she was worried the whole time. I got guilted for needing to miss a week. Then the next day, guess who got the flu? My sister. So, she got tested. Guess what, no flu. She acted sick all morning, but as soon as mom told her she could miss school, 2 hours later, she was riding her bike and doing cart wheels in the yard. No yelling, no punishment One time she threw my 80's, rare wrestling figures into a muddy ditch, ruining the paint job. Nothing. There was one birthday, she got $100, my birthday came, only 75. You know, around this time I started to watch lots of anime. I pretended I was in their worlds, it always brought me happiness. I tried to get my mom interested, but she never did. Then, one weekend, I asked her to play Mario with me, like the good old days. But, my sister showed up, with a Dragon Ball Z DVD, battle of gods movie. She asked if I wanted to watch it, I said no because I’ve seen that movie 10 times already. Mom got mad at me, and watched it with her. For 5 years I’ve been begging her to watch it with me, but she never could. I sat and watched it with them, because she said if I did, she'd play with me. She sat through the whole movie with her. So, after waiting over an hour for her to play with me. She finally showed, played one level, and went to bed because she was too tired. We'd play in the morning she said, that morning never came. Then, my graduation. Around this time, she moved in with our dad. They all came to my graduation, but she mostly talked to her the whole time, begging her to come visit. Also, funnily enough, I never got told congratulations or anything for graduation. She never posted how proud she was of me on Facebook, or anything. But, that same year, my sister made the honor roll. I never heard the end of it. So, recently, last year I got an injury. and that brought on a whole slew of crap. Most of these involve me wanting privacy for my problems and her showing up when not wanted. First, was physical therapy. She just had to come, without even asking me, mom said yes. I told her no, I didn't want her to go. We had a huge fight, and we didn't go. Then, was a checkup. I didn't want her to come, but she did anyway. There was no reason for her to go, they just sat in the lobby. This was a very personal thing, and I wanted as few people there as possible. I remember mom wheeled me in, (I was in a wheelchair), and sis said she'd wait in our car. Nope, guess who walked in. Mom largely ignored me at my own appointment. Therapy and Doctor's appointments were the only time we really got together. Then, another time I asked her to play a game with me. She actually did, then in 5 minutes, guess who called out. My sister, mom just disappeared, and never came back, so I just turned it off. And finally, the most recent example. I actually planned on moving out. I needed a 10-dollar box. I begged and asked for weeks, and it took seemingly forever to buy me that box, but my sister asked for a 300-dollar dress, and she got it bought for her in less than a day. ",hammerfan12.txt

Well, to cut an EXTREMELY long story short, it wasn't and after alot of screaming, and alot of profanities being used, i ended up vending my anger into the nearest wall, which happened to be concrete.

After an extremely heated discussion, ( more like we were ripping eachothers heads off ) we decided to go down to the police station, ( about 15 min drive awa ) and report the bike stolen. When we were reporting the details to the nice constable, he immediately jerked his head up and said "" oh, is this yours??""

1,"I don’t want to lose friendship of 10 years but I think it’s going that way Hi guys, I don’t usually do this but I literally feel like I have nowhere else to vent. Ok. I have been friends with this person for 10 years since we were teenagers. We both clicked over time through going to the same school and I really liked her personality. We ended up going to college in the same city so during that time we sometimes hung out and I let her stay over at my place a few times when she needed to. After graduation she’s spent some time living in other countries teaching and we have kept in contact but not as much, though we have met up when she’s been back. So the last time I saw her in person was when she was on a break from teaching 3 months ago. Since then we have occasionally talked but it’s been me sending messages more than her. The last time we Skyped was 2 months ago and last time we had a proper conversation was a month and a half ago when I asked her for some advice about a trip I was going on. I then stopped messaging her for a few weeks as I didn’t want to bother her if she was busy. Started messaging again but just sending a few pictures of my trip and seeing if she wanted to talk. She saw my messages but didn’t reply. So I left it another week - I sent her a few messages today but again she was online and reading them and no reply. I have tried not to bother her if she’s busy and have stressed to her that I don’t want to bother her but she has just gone silent on me since late January and it’s basically been me trying to initiate conversation with her and her not responding. The thing is I am racking my brain and trying to think what I could have done to upset her - if anything, and I can’t think of anything. I have questioned whether I’m getting ahead of myself but then not having her around makes me miss her and feel hurt that she’s suddenly decided to stop talking to me for whatever reason. The thing is I have been considering what loss it would be for me to not be friends with her anymore - It wouldn’t be easy for me as she is one of the only few people I still speak to from my school days and we could relate so much to each other. But if for some mysterious reason she’s cut me off and no longer wants to be friends then what can I do? I basically sent her a message saying I wouldn’t try contacting her again voluntarily and left it at that. I feel like I may never hear from her again and it really hurts. But what can I do? If something isn’t there anymore then it’s just not there. - A 20 something year old female who is tired of petty childish bullshit ",bibs93.txt
0,"I lost my father to a sudden and completely unexpected heart attack two weeks ago. I've been up and down, but right now I'm at a loss. What are some strategies you'd employ(secular wise, i'm non religious). I suffer from severe anxiety(GAD) and severe depression. xpost /r/griefsupport I'm going to seek counselling by the way very soon. My Dad's service hasn't happened yet. I was planning after that to start up again but with this added part. So yeah, my dad showing no signs of it, had a massive heart attack on the 14th and passed away on the 16th at 73 years old. I realize people's times do come, and he had health problems(As far as we knew, no heart disease, had been checked out) but he didn't smoke or drink and he lost a lot of weight and took care of himself for the most part. He was slowing down, but no more then an older person would. To say it was a shock would be putting it mildly. I ugly cried in front of him and his hospital bed several times. I'm just so broken up for my mom and my family. Of course, me too. But my Mom and Dad were married for 45 years. And although it wasn't perfect, they had a true love. And I have such a close relationship with my mother. So when her heart is breaking it's hard for me to see. I sponge it. I feel that pain. I've also unfortunately had to deal with siblings who are dealing with this tragedy by lashing out and trying to put themselves ahead of myself and my brother. (My sister and other brother). And that's been super difficult. They've said some ugly things that I'm trying to look past at the current moment. Anyways, I just wanted to know other then counselling, if there's anything you feel that might be of use to me and my brain to move forward without Dad. Depression has creeped in the last few days with the grief to give it a double whammy. Also had a massive panic attack yesterday as well, which I expected but it never prepares you for it. Anyways. Thank you. Sorry if I seem scrambled. Obviously it's an overload of processing. ",neuralrunes.txt
0,"I don't know what it's like to be not depressed. Hi my name is ahmulz and I'm depressed. Been depressed arguably since I was 15 (25 now). Looking back on my childhood, I can definitely see some signs of childhood depression. The past year has been particularly bad in terms of my mental health. I'm better than I was a year ago. I've joined a gym. I do pole dancing. I got a cat. I have a therapist. I'm medicated. I volunteer more. I see occasional good things in myself. I'm not actively suicidal anymore. Yet... I'm still depressed. I've changed my life so fucking much and I'm still fucking depressed. I still have more work to do to ""fix myself"" (fucking diet, fucking exercise, bullshit mindfulness) but it all just feels like so much goddamn work at the end of the day. I don't know what I'm working towards. I can't comprehend a world in which I don't wake up in an apartment that needs to be cleaned because I'm too tired and too lazy to do it or that I don't spend my time in a numb, self-loathing void. I don't know how people get through their days liking themselves or liking their life. It's frustrating and lonely.

I just felt like I needed advice from people who might understand. I'm in my early twenties and just graduated with a bachelor degree in psych in October. I never really had a job during that time because I was lucky to have my school and expenses paid for and I wanted to focus on school. I've only had one job but it was 5 years ago just at a fast food place. My boyfriend of almost 4 years and I live together. He has a great job and pays for 2/3 of our expenses and I pay the rest. He's recently told me he doesn't see a future for us if I don't get my life together and find a job and start putting more into the relationship. I feel this is coming at a bad time because ever since I graduated I am really anxious and depressed. I find it hard to even get up in the morning, chores get neglected, I don't even want to get out of the safety of my bed. The world is bleak and I'm sad all the time. I can't sleep all night and then sleep till mid afternoon. I feel like my life is just staying home and having to do chores and feel sad. I try to apply to entry level jobs like cashier at the grocery store but no one calls back. I don't know what to do because I want to get better and don't want to lose my bf but I can't even get an interview to work at a high school level job.

1,"Did I do the right thing? Hello,reddit.First of all,I want to begin this by saying that English isn't my first language,so please do forgive me if I make mistakes here and there. Let's get straight to the point: I'm in highschool,10th grade.I've known my ''best friend'' since 1st grade.Y'know,it was that kind of nice,pleasant friendship,I was always there for her,she was always there for me,even travelling togheter,laughing with tears,told me many times that I'm her only ''true friend'' etc etc... and everything seemed to be alright...until she got a boyfriend. She started to ignore,even get mad me me as to why I don't text it first..well,why does it matter so much who texts first? Seems like a childish thinking in my opinion.I told her that I can't be the only person that talks in this friendship,so she told me she'll text me first.She never did,but I saw it coming anyway. I realized that for her, it did not matter whether I am next to her or not.She is  so apathetic,almost to the point where it hurted me.But I decided to let go,focus more on myself,study more,read more,invest in my own hobbies and so on,so forth.As I was doing these,I started learning more things about myself,discovering things I didn't know about until now.And all of these happened,because I decided to leave her.She noticed this behaviour of mine and actually started talking to me,but it wouldn't matter anyway because it was an endless cycle.All she sees now is her boyfriend,I think the only reason she goes to school is just to see him,nothing else. As I look back at our past [which is,kind of,sorta tragic and I don't want to into detail],I realized that I was the only one who truly cared.I always cried for her,I wonder if she cried for me,at least once?She blocked on me on our social medias for the stupidest reasons [She thought I was annoyed because she was talking too much about her boyfriend] and somehow I was but I didn't want to show it..but what did she accomplish by blocking me for almost a month,anyway? Couldn't she talk to me about it,at least? I told her in the most sincere way that I missed her very much through that period of time and even started worrying,crying in the middle of the night.Her response was short and dry,as usual. I got fed up,starting to blame myself because I always accepted all of her bullshit.I broke our friendship,leaving her confused and perhaps angry at me. [I just started ignoring her and she noticed this]. Did I do the right thing? We haven't talked for almost 3-4 weeks. ",Egritte.txt
0,"ok, so today i had another freak out. I woke up feeling good ... it was supposed to be my first therapy session (which i and my boyfriend were happy about) and then after this i was supposed to meet up with my boyfriend for lunch, check my test marks, and then go to the library with my boyfriend to study. These plans changed... When i walked into the therapy office, they said no appointment was scheduled. All of a sudden i felt really rejected, not worthy of an appointment (like they gave it to someone else), anxious, sick to my stomach, a little dizzy. I've been waiting since February for this appointment! I couldn't deal with my anger properly or the fact that my plans for therapy were ruined today. I started stuttering kind of i kind of got all dazed out and really sick when the receptionist wanted to schedule another appointment. So, it's tomorrow at 9am ... 9am!!! What bastards. Anyway, so because i got all weird ... i didn't want to be around people. I called my boyfriend ... couldn't get a hold of him. I cancelled .... didn't check my marks, didn't go to the library, or lunch or see my boyfriend. I left. I told my boyfriend i had bad anxiety. So, now he wants a ""break.""

I've been rocking a lot too on my rocking chair ... it's a weird compulsive soothing mechanism i have. Don't ask. I'm mad at my boyfriend because he decided to take a break when i needed him most.

0,"I'm in a reflective mood today. I received a phone call this afternoon from the sister of my old neighbor, who I will call Alice. She had passed away this morning. Alice had been fighting terminal colon cancer since March and after harsh chemo therapy and a bout with pneumonia that landed her in the ICU, she decided that enough was enough. She stopped treatment just around the July 4th weekend. I'm not too exact on the details, but suffice it to say that she failed quickly after that and passed away in her sleep this morning surrounded by family and friends. She was only 52. As I struggle with Depression, AD/HD, tic disorders, sleep apnea, insomnia, food allergies, pollen allergies, and a weak immunity system I sometimes feel that life is unfair. I used to say that the Universe was out to get me, that God's having his little joke with me. I suppose it's only natural to feel that way. It's a full plate and I'm not too hungry for what's on the menu. Then I encounter other people with other hardships and I see that life itself is not fair to an awful lot of people. Life is, in fact, a lousy chef. What struck me as sad today, however, was not simply the passing of somebody I knew. Instead I was struck with my own mortality and weakness. Let me explain. Alice and some other neighbors hadn't been too kind to me when I moved into the area. They had accused me of various deviant behaviors that to this day still anger me. These were supposed to be my Christian brothers and sisters and instead they wielded stones. The rumors mounted as the months progressed, wilder and wilder, until they reached a crescendo where they became so outlandish that it was easy to disprove them. When all the furor amounted to nothing a lot of people were left with egg on their face. That summer several of the families involved moved away. I have unresolved issues with them, but with Alice, my neighbor, I was able to find forgiveness in my heart. The story didn't end happily there with us arm in arm, though. Alice never really apologized to me, though her behavior towards my family and myself became kinder. Unfortunately, she was one of the people I knew who didn't believe in AD/HD. One day she told me her opinion on the subject right to my face after I mentioned I had it. I was so stunned by her bold opinion that I stood there slack jawed. I swore that day I would never let that happen to me again. You see a bit of that fire in this blog whenever anybody accuses me of not having a ""real"" problem. I am as fierce in person as well. Thanks to Alice. And now she's passed on. Suddenly my anger feels petty and shallow. She moved away and now has died, but I allowed her to change me. I nursed a wound like an angry coal in my heart. I forgave her for one thing, but held a grudge for another. She became representative of all the doubters in my life and I used that as impetus for change. What type of person does that make me? On top of that, I have set lofty goals for myself that are proving hard to meet. Time is ticking and my 40th birthday is but a scant five months away. One of the byproducts of meeting those goals was to have a book with my name on it that I could bring into her elementary school classroom one day, slam on her desk, and say ""Ha!"" - as if my success would mean anything to her. As if that would prove my struggle with AD/HD was real. How silly. How foolish. Alice was only thirteen years older than I. I can blink and be 52 tomorrow. Mortality laughs at me and replaces all of life's menu items with sour grapes and rotten eggs. What shall I order now? Usually, my sense of humor keeps my spirits alight. Today, however, I see myself as being revealed as a small-minded man with insignificant goals. That even for a moment, no matter how miniscule, I was sad she died before my goals were met... This both sickens me and splashes me in the face with a brisk dose of reality. December looms and I read news? Time leaks through my fingers and I'm worried about a drop in comments on my blog? How did I get so turned around? Where did I get so terribly sidetracked? I need to remember what it is I want out of life. It is not to show up the doubters but to find joy in my own accomplishments. I know that, but negative thought attaches itself to our most noble intentions like a parasite. Allow it to stay too long and it consumes and replaces what was once good and uplifting. I don't resent Alice. I never wished her ill. But I regret I let myself hold a grudge, however slight it seemed. Life is too short for such things. So I will allow Alice to change me again. That way when I order from the menu of life it will not be just desserts. ",spacedoll_e_1_b_1_us.txt
0,"Hi everyone I am new here. I guess I will start from the top with my story. At the age of 17 I was hospitalized for bipolar disorder which I do not think I have. Anyways I was hospitalized twice medicines worked for a while but then I would just crash down into a further depression. At the age of 18 I stopped all medicines because I was happy and didn't think they were really doing anything to help me. Since that time I still suffer occasional bouts of depression. I will also add in that my mom has schizoaffective disorder and that I have many aunts and uncles with depression. I am now soon to be 26 and I just feel very alone. I am married and I work and go to school right now. I am just overwhelmed I don't want to go to my classes I don't feel like it is worth my time I feel like no one cares if I succeed or fail.

I just feel worthless the only thing I even enjoy anymore is work and lately that has not given me much enjoyment at all I use to be eager to be there and now I am anxious to get off of work and come home and not do anything. My husband and I have been fighting a lot lately he has an anger problem that we have been trying to work through, and it is negatively impacting the way I feel. I can also tell though that he is worried about me he keeps asking me if I am ok or if I am mad at him I just don't really feel anything right now I am just numb.

I am tired all the time, yet I can't sleep at night that well but I have been falling asleep in the middle of the afternoons. I overreact to little things and the list goes on. I know what can happen if I let this go on. I nearly lost my life to the negative thoughts when I was younger that is the only reason I got help then.

0,Hi. My name is Jenna. I'm 20 years old and just joined and figured that I should introduce myself. I found this site from searching online and think that it's great. I only started accepting the fact that I've been depressed last year because I've always been very good at hiding it from everyone else and I used to fool myself as well (if that makes sense). I've never been one to seek help from others because in the past I've always dealt with everything myself. The start of college and being outside (different state) of my home environment (which is the cause of a lot of anger and resentment that I also have) helped me to see that there was something wrong with the way that I was living and that I could reach out and get help. I'm currently seeing a counselor (through my college and since I feel like I'm working well with her that I don't need to seek other outside help yet) about my anxiety and depression but I feel that talking to others that are going through the same thing could help give me a different view on everything and be helpful as well.

I just failed a statistics quiz and went to my car and wept for 10 minutes. I don't know why. I feel alone all the time, and I feel like I can't please anyone no matter what I do.

0,"Hi I am trying to get a grip back on my life. My mental health has cost me my marriage. My husband just couldn't handle it anymore. I was hospitalized five times in April and May for suicidal attempt and thoughts. He was there every day for me but felt abandoned by me. As he said through tears ""he couldn't save me"". After the hospitalizations I was really needy. He married a strong and independent woman. In Sept I took myself off my medicines and went into a rage and accused him of cheating on me. That broke his heart and his spirit...he left. Of course, I went into a tailspin. Finally got of the couch last weekend, three months later. I stopped my counseling and medicines. I know I have to get it back together again. I guess looking for support here is a step in the right direction. I am trying to figure out how to go on when you lost the best thing that ever happened to you. Thanks for listening ",pattireit_e_2_b_1_xx.txt

1,"How do you tell your kids to handle weird adults? When I was 14, my best friend's mom started accusing me of smoking. I'd been best friends with her daughter since we were in 1st grade and I was over their house all the time. But for some reason when I was 14, she started asking. And she very low key but repeatedly accused me of smoking for about 2 more years. I had always been a straight A kid, top of my class, and a ""good"" kid. I had tried one cigarette when I was 13, had HATED it, and never tried another. I wasn't around anyone who smoked, no friends, no peers, no family members (immediate or extended) smoked, so there's no chance I smelled like smoke. But friend's mom persisted, and told me that she thought that I smoked because she found cigarette butts at the end of their driveway. Because obviously that couldn't have been from anyone else right? Now in hindsight, her behavior was absolutely bizarre. As a teen, I accepted it as, she's an adult, and while I questioned her and vigorously fought back whenever she'd say something, it never occurred to me to get a sane adult involved. I'm hoping to install in my kid that they should tell me stuff like that if it ever happens. While nothing truly bad happened in my case, the lady was off her rocker, and I'm lucky nothing else happened. How did people with older kids do that? Like I know my parents gave me the ""if people are making you uncomfortable, talk to us"" speech but this never made me upset, I just got angry and baffled at first, but then it kind of became this joke among all our friends and we just laughed at her. In hindsight, this could have ended very poorly for me had the mom escalated. ",BlushingBride603.txt

1,"Am i a bad friend? I don't know what to do Recently two friends of mine (dating) have cut me off entirely without providing a reason... Let's call them J and K. J is an old friend from years back, when we were kids, and K has been my friend since highschool (approx. Six years). Its happened before that they've cut me off periodically for no given reason, then their idea of making up is inviting me to a party and never speaking of the weeks or months that they had me blocked on social media, when i ask them to explain they get defensive, and say things along the lines of ""you KNOW what you did"" even when i try to explain that no, i actually don't. I've never consciously done anything to hurt them, the one thing i thought it could be was that I'm friends with a girl they dislike, but after recently confronting J its apparently not just that, there's a long list of reasons why I'm a terrible friend but he ""doesn't have time to list them"" or even name one. Feeling insecure about this I've confided in other friends who assure me that I'm not a bad friend, although I've asked that they tell me if i ever act like a bitch. Back to K and J, they recently went so far as to invite all 3 of my siblings along with a crowd of people they barely know to their housewarming, but made a point to exclude me- when my brother asked why the response was along the lines of I'm ""acting like a bitch"". I've tried just cutting them out but its hard after being friends (i think) for so many years. I've tried extending olive branches, explaining that i don't know what I've done wrong and if they could at least tell me then maybe i could apologize/fix the situation, but J responded with passive aggression and K, so far, hasn't responded at all. (Quite frankly i don't expect her to). Bottom line is, should i just cut them off entirely? Its hard since I'll be seeing a lot of K this year as we're studying the same course, and J is one of my brother's best friends. Please help ",Airvian.txt
1,"I don’t want to continue like this For the past few years, I’ve found it extremely difficult to talk to my mom. Some family drama happened a while back and ever since then she’s been really tense and on edge. Almost every time we have a conversation it turns into a debate, usually ending in me sobbing and her yelling (I’m not trying to paint myself as the victim; I’ve said some nasty things to her as well). I’m afraid to bring up my anxiety/depression, because whenever I have in the past she rants about how therapy and medication doesn’t work, there are plenty of natural remedies, yada yada yada. I just want to not start panicking every time I’m in public! She’ll often blow things way out of preportion to what they actually are. If my tone changes during a conversation, or I let out a heavier breath, she thinks I’m “talking back” or scoffing at something she said and start yelling and threatening me. I feel like it might be paranoia, and it’s getting worse. I basically dread every interaction I have to have with her, but I would really like to have normal mother/daughter conversations, go shopping, have her help me with homework, whatever. Instead of arguing nonstop from morning till night. I just fucking hate it. Am I being dramatic? If not, what can I do to remedy the situation? If so, then it wouldn’t be the first time.

I live in a small town, so when I went to the doctor about possible ADHD (i was moody, couldn't focus on work, couldn't complete tasks on time etc), they determined I was bipolar and put me on Effexor and Wellbutrin.

0,can I be fired for going to the hospital again? I missed 2 months of work and went in FMLA last year for inpatient and then out patient. I'm getting worried that I'll try to kill myself soon and think maybe I should go inpatient to get a few days away from everything and maybe then I won't be as much if a danger to myself and can think more clearly. I'm really worried that if I leave work for a week or two again that I'll be fired. idk what to do.

1,"My brother and I were at a mall yesterday with two of our closest friends, Carly and Jessica.  I realized something yesterday, no matter what has happened in our lives they have always been there through good and bad times.  I realized that whenever I need someone to talk to I have always been able to count on the twins to listen and to tell me their opinions.  They have always been at our house growing up, whenever school let out, they'd be over for sure. Its hard for me to think of days when they haven't been over at our house. The four of us have done practically everything together.   They are two of my true friends. I have very few friends that I could say that about.  Not many people know me as well as these gals. Now that we are getting older our lives will most likely be keeping us from seeing each other as much as we have in the past, but I know that no matter where we are we will be friends. They have meant so much to me in my life that I can't even explain to you in this one simple blog. I have tried my best to show you, but this is only a scratch of the surface of what these two mean to me. I just hope that I have been as good a friend to them as they both have been to me.  It is there birthday today and I just want to wish a happy birthday to two of the greatest people I know.  Happy 16th. ",3427006.200405230.male.17.txt

I can’t trust the guy cause he’ll share your secrets to the whole group (including you) just to be funny. He’s a major hypocrite. He bullies my other friend. This guy has been pretty much my best friend for a very long time, and I don’t know what to do. He says I’m his best friend, and it seems like that when it’s only me with him, but when there are other people there, he just leaves me in the dust, even though he always complains about when his friends hang out with someone else (like I said he’s a hypocrite). He makes me feel like a worthless piece of shit sometimes. I want to stop being friends with this guy, but he’s friends with all of my other friends. I can’t even seem to get him out of my life if I even try (our parents are pretty good friends). I just don’t have no idea what to do. Any advice would be greatly apprecited.

I have been on a high dose of Lamictal for 6 years to treat bipolar disorder.  I have gone to regular appointments and have had consistent refills. I had a period of intense depression in which I went on a one month drinking binge and went to a hospital where I was given Ativan to deal with the withdrawal.  It wasn't a consistent prescription, just enough pills to ween off the withdrawal and ensure I wouldn't relapse back to drinking. My psychiatrist just called me and told me she is terminating me as a patient and is unable to see me or refill my lamictal because I was prescribed Ativan by another physician.  I am freaking out about the effects of stopping this cold turkey.  I only took the Ativan for one week, two months ago.  I just want to have my lamictal refilled.

When I was a kid, I only thought he had some illusions about life because he had always talking about unreal things. We were watching TV and the editors were discussing some news, instead of listening and talking about related topics (as normal people do) he started to shout that they were stupid and made up his own story that us all knew it told no true information. If it's your family's case, maybe your parents would try to talk to him or do something, but mine did nothing. When I argued with him over such false information, my parents even stopped me and said ""Why do you have to argue with your poor brother?"" I thought they would never tell him what's wrong and what's right. At age of 10, once he told me to pack things up 'cause we would go for a trip with my mom's friends, I had no doubt and did exactly what he had said. Of course, one day later I found out he lied. At that moment, he looked at me with his wicked eyes and laughed. That's the moment I realized he's such an attention seeker, he's selfish and just wanted the world to turn around himself. Since then, my parents never listen to me as I say he's not a fool, he's slippery even. And others saying I was blessed because all the bad luck on his place so I could live, study and be the only child that parents could be proud of.

I am not sure if I would want to return, as i have now done the whole statue of liberty, show on Broadway, baseball game thing... but saying that I do think I would like to go back with a bunch of mates and just go crazy!

0,"I just don't know how to deal with this shit anymore. I can remember being depressed and having anxiety as early as 15 years old (31 now). I'm sure I have been happy some time along the way but I can't remember. I think most of the ""good"" times were just when I had enough energy to pretend and delude myself and convince everybody around me that I was normal and healthy. Unfortunately, as time has gone on my times of stability have gotten shorter, and my major depressive episodes have only gotten much worse, and lasted longer. I've dropped out of 4 different colleges and have quit every job I have ever had, most of them with literally no notice. I have seen doctors, I've been on different medications with no noticeable effects. I am see a doctor now, but am hoping to get in to see a psychiatrist or mental health specialist soon, but that could be a month or two away at this point. I am just completely exhausted at this point and don't know how much longer I can take it. My parent just keep telling me I need to get a job, like that would make everything better. It definitely doesn't help that they try to get me to go to church with the every other week or ask me all the time if I have met any girls that I'm interested in. They can't understand that just taking a shower on any given day or leaving the apartment to buy groceries is a monumental task. They ask if I am suicidal, as if that is the only way to tell how severe my depression is. I don't consider myself suicidal, but I no longer have a desire to continue living. Every day I wake up is another disappointment, another day of being incapable of doing anything and feeling sorry for myself. I'm pretty sure the main reason that I'm not suicidal is that I am convinced that I would fail or just wouldn't be able to go through with it and the embarrassment would be too much to handle. As much as my family frustrates me, I understand that they are trying to help but they just don't know how. They have supported me financially on several occasions before now. Without their help I would almost certainly be homeless or dead by now. All I want is to not feel this way anymore. Every time I leave my apartment I am tense and in fear of the people around me.

But this is fun because there isn't a single person (well, okay, except maybe my sister), who know that this is really me. Let the fun begin!!!  To give you a better idea of who I am and what I like, I figured that I would start out with some websites that I check frequently. I get my basic news headlines here: www.usatoday.com. I also really like the sight because it has a lot of entertainment news and fun chats so when I am really bored at work, I can bug people besides my coworkers (which is a word that I have never really liked because every time I look at it, I only see the word ""cow."" Granted, some of my coworkers have been along the ""cow"" lines, but still...that is just mean).

So I check out www.review.com, www.lawschooldiscussion.com, www.xoxohth.com, and www.lawschoolnumbers.com for some up to date information. Okay, so I am actually really excited about going to law school. I know that millions of people are doing it- so I thought that I would be one of those millions. No, just kidding... I know that the job market will be tough when I get out but it is tough right now and I can't stand my job. Why not get more edu-ma-ca-tion? It is almost funny...I haven't told my friends that I am going to law school. I have good reason but that is definitely something for another entry.  I love to travel and like to check out www.elliott.org for info about deals and new travel news.   I also check out www.eonline.com for celebrity news- yes, I am one of those people.

1,"Sister dislikes me. So me and my sister barely speak and barely see each other, but today just made it clear how much she dislikes me. She spoke to everyone but me, I could even see her giving her fiancé looks every time I spoke- I suffer from chronic depression and anxiety so when I tried to speak to my family in the room she would speak over me about something else to that same person I was speaking to. You see, I had an abortion just months before she became pregnant and ever since then she has been off with me. She gives me looks every time I go near her son or even when I attempt to smile at her. I just don't even know anymore. Her son is 2 just to give you a reference of how long it's been. We was fine during my process of going through the abortion but now she just doesn't care to try.

1,"A friend cut me off So recently a friend of mine cut me off and I’m not really sure why. I guess to understand my concern it would be best to get the whole story. I had first met her earlier this school year. Our desks were right next to each other in math class. Back then, she was very talkative, sociable, optimistic, and energetic around me. I’m not always the most talkative type but that didn’t seem to bother her at all. She always shouted for my attention to say hi to me when passed each other in the halls. She asked for my number, introduced me to a few of her friends, and even invited me over to her house for lunch during one of our off periods. We texted a couple times though I will admit each time I kept feeling like I was annoying her. Eventually, she had invited me to come with her boyfriend and group of friends to hang out at the mall over Christmas vacation. I was so excited. However, when the day finally came, I couldn’t help but feel like a third wheel. She was much more focused on her boyfriend than she was on anyone else and the only time she noticed me was when I had wandered off without telling any of them. That wasn’t cool of me, I admit, but I just didn’t feel needed or even wanted there at times. Later that night though, I texted her and apologized for not being that social but she it was all fine. But I still couldn’t shake the feeling that she was upset with me. When we came back from vacation, my suspicions grew. She was a lot more quiet and distant from me and was usually on her phone with her headphones in whenever I was around. It was around this time that I started to become a lot more needy. She still responded to my texts and told me that the reason she was so quiet was because she had a headache. But I couldn’t help but notice that she was still pretty social around her other friends. At one point when we were walking in the halls, she had her headphones in and didn’t say a word to me but the minute she saw one of her other friends, she took her headphones out and screamed for his attention. All while I was standing right next to her. It was a week before winter vacation when we got into an argument. You see, she was aware of my depression and offered her assistance in helping me deal with it. However, in our argument, she expressed her displeasure with how she felt she was putting in all the effort into dealing with my problems. I tried apologizing to her, probably getting a bit too dramatic about it, but she just expressed her annoyance at how I constantly needed her assurance and that if I don’t try to change myself, she won’t be my friend anymore. Eventually, I apologized for my part in the argument and how I didn’t make her help feel appreciated, but I also explained to her that I was doing something about my depression. I see a psychiatrist and take antidepressants every night. Still, she insisted that I needed to change. But by this point, whenever I spoke to her in person, she always seemed disinterested and kind of annoyed. When I asked her if she had a problem with me, she would always say that she was either busy or wasn’t in the mood for it. Eventually, she responded that she needed space for the whole vacation, so I didn’t text her at all. But when the vacation was over, I tried to text if everything was fine now only to discover that she had blocked my number. Now, she doesn’t even acknowledge my presence anymore and almost seems to actively avoid me. I apologize if this is really long. I just wanted to be as detailed as possible. At this point, I just feel at a loss and confused about what happened. I’m not sure if I did something wrong or if she was ever my friend at all. I mean, our friendship felt genuine those first months before Christmas. But now I just don’t know what to think or do. ",mtgo02987.txt
0,"Does anyone else get very irritable whenever you're hungry? The biggest problem in my life is that I get extremely irritable when I'm hungry. I'll find myself fantasizing about getting in argument or getting mad about something and then kinda snap out of it and realize I'm actually just hungry. Then I get something to eat and I can feel some of the stress melting away, taking deep breaths and shit. This happens every day. This makes me pretty cranky while I'm making something to eat in the kitchen. If anyone tries to talk to me I just want nothing to do with them until I get some food in me. It's putting a real strain on some of my relationships. I'm struggling with this because it's really hard to balance not overeating with not being irritable. I don't really know whats going on.

1,"Abusive dad or I'm just toxic... Two weeks ago, my dad lost our dog. It went to the shelter but due to the microchip ownership issue, we have to wait two weeks to get her. I told my family that there's a chance that we might not get the dog back. My dad then started saying how it's fate that the dog is gone and that if we can't get it back then it's destiny. I got annoyed and said ""But really, it's because you weren't being careful and you left her at the park"". He then started yelling at me. Saying he's the only one who walks the dog. I then said I walk the dogs as well, I just don't do it enough because I'm the only one in the family who works from morning to night, paying for the bills, groceries and everything. He then claimed that it's not his fault and then started saying how if someone told him to look after their child and he accidently killed it, would it be his fault. I responded with yes, it is your fault because it's under your duty of care. Anyway, things got ugly from there. I didn't speak to him for a week. He got my sister to ask me to pay for his bills and fines. I paid for the $500 one today this morning. Then he asked to borrow my car, and I lent it to him. After that, he came back and started throwing passive jabs at me by talking to the dog. e.g. ""Bailey, you're lucky that I'm here. If i wasn't here, you would've died a long time ago. Some people just know how to talk and don't do shit."" I got annoyed and said you lost the dog. Get over it. He then yelled at me. I got annoyed and told him to fuck off. He then started saying ""wow, you're being so disrespectful. God will punish you. I wish you die and I wish you'll live out your life alone."" I then said ""You came home and started a fight for no reason. Don't play the victim when I argue back"". He then said ""I'm just talking to myself. You don't have to listen to me."" I then said ""Go talk to the wall then."" I shut the door and continue with my business. He then walked next to my door and started going on and on about how I'll die soon for being disrespectful and that god will send a lightning bolt to hit me. I then angrily snapped at him saying ""I may or may not die before you, but I can bet that if you die, no one in this fucking world would mourn for you"". I then shut the door, and I didn't hear anything from him again. Not sure if I have a abusive father or I'm just toxic or maybe it's both. I don't want to live like this anymore. ",renewreborn.txt

1,"My wife wants another baby, I don't. Are we headed for divorce? Hi all,  I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this so let me know if it's not.  The title pretty much is why I'm here but let me give you some background. My wife and I dated for about a year before she got pregnant.  We quickly got married and had our first girl in 2005.  In 2008 we had our son, followed by our third, another girl, in 2009.  We were crazy busy for a while there and things finally calmed down a few years ago.  We made up for that by deciding that we should move to a nicer area.  We live in Vancouver where property costs a fortune.  To afford that, my wife had to go back to work full time.  She had been working 3 days a week.  She is a teacher so she still gets the summers, Christmas and spring break at home with the kids.  She kind of half joked about having a fourth child before the move but when we moved it was clear that we couldn't afford another baby. Now we've been in our new home for about 1.5 years.  The kids have made new friends, settled into their new school and sports teams.  Our oldest will be heading to high school next year. Now my wife wants a new baby.  She is obsessed with it.  It's all she thinks about and all she talks about.  She says the kids are getting older and they're not going to need her soon and she's getting depressed about it.  Every couple weeks it boils over and we fight or she bursts into tears again. I don't want another baby.  Our youngest is 8, our oldest is 12.  I don't want to go back there.  I've moved on from the baby stage and I love where we're at right now.  We are crazy busy with sports and activities most of the year (hockey x2, baseball x3, swimming, art class, etc....).  I am happy where we are, I don't feel like anything is missing, there's no hole in my life. If we were to have another baby, we'd have to move again.  Change the kids schools again.  Have the kids meet new friends again and join new sports teams again.  I don't want to do that to them.  I've also been carrying the financial burden for the last 12 years as my wife had finally give back to work full time.  I'm not saying she wasn't working at home taking care of the kids, she was.  I am saying that if we missed a mortgage payment, that was on me and it's stressful and it's nice to have some sort on that department once again. I don't really know what to do, I'm afraid we're headed for a divorce but that's the last thing I want.  Should I have a baby so she won't divorce me?  What if we're in the same spot eight years from now when the baby starts to grow up a bit.  I asked her if she would go speak to a counselor with me but she says it won't change her mind that she wants another baby. ",woohoo-77.txt

0,"I don’t want to be an adult anymore. I’ve been struggling with my depression a lot lately and I really really wish I could turn to one of my parents to tell them how much I’m struggling. More importantly, I wish I could tell one of them and one of them cared. I know I’m a decent disappointment to both of them for several reasons. 1) I haven’t had a decent job. I’ve been floating on jobs that get me less than five hours a week. 2) I don’t have friends. Granted, that’s because my mother literally and intentionally isolated me so I have no social skills at all. 3) I have big dreams but zero motivation in life so I can’t even try to achieve them. So what I’m trying to do is work on myself. Today I started a new (third, I now have three of these stupid things) job. I thought I did pretty good considering the store didn’t burn down and no one told me that I was a failure. But literally as soon as the sun set, I feel all my doubt and darkness telling that I’m lying to myself. That I’m being naive by thinking that I did well, that I was probably a huge burden to everyone else in the store. But I’m trying, so that has to count for something right? I went and got a third job on my own, so why don’t I feel like I should be proud of myself? I have no friends. In fact, during 2017, I was so excited to have made a great friend and I was completely betrayed by them. The kind of betrayal where I walked away from a friendship and haven’t bothered reading the apologies they’ve sent me. I’ve tried reconnecting with friend that I had earlier in life, but I’m not doing so well. I feel like they will do something to me and then I’ll lose another friend. And logically, if I’m the only common factor in all my failed friendships, then I must be the problem, right? I must be the problem. I’m the problem. Maybe I’m not meant to have friends. And I’ve always had big dreams for myself. But because of how I was raised, I have no accountability. Because seriously, why bother trying if everything I do is going to be met with disapproval and anger? So I’ve been trying really hard to make myself follow at least one goal. I chose to go for my art. Problem being that with my depression crashing on me in waves, I’m really struggling to stick to my goal of one art post a day. I’m trying really hard but I’m so afraid that I’ll be the failure I was taught to be. In all of this, I just really really wish I could quit trying to be an adult and go back to the days when I believed my mom when she said she loved me, I want to go back to when my dad wanted to help me talk things out so I could figure out what I was doing. I want to be able to call my mom up and tell her that I feel like a complete failure and that I can’t add to see my therapist and that I need help talking the darkness down. But if I call her, she’ll one-up me because I’m the biggest mistake of her life. Or worse, she’ll tell me that I should try (fill in the blank with whatever bs Facebook depression fix is trending). I want to be able to call my mom and say hey, I got another job and I’m excited. I want her to tell me that she’s proud of me. I really want to have a conversation with my dad that doesn’t involve the phrase “well get over it”. ‘Hey dad, I’m full of regret and turmoil’ ‘ugh just get over it’ well excuse me sir for being by the reality that I just pulled a mulan and cut all my hair off so that I could get another job. I went from having shoulder length hair that made me feel good about myself to hair that’s half an inch long and highlights everything about my face that gives me horrible anxiety. Maybe I’m really hurting because I went in to work yesterday and two of my managers greeted me with ‘ew gross, what happened to your hair?’ And now I feel like I’m as ugly as I think I am. I really miss being a kid when I could pretend that my world wasn’t on fire or that I wasn’t drowning. And I don’t know how to make any of the darkness back up so that I can breathe. I really wish that I could see my therapist this week. ",ShiftingStar.txt

1,"How To Befriend Someone I Had An Awkward Past With? I had this female friend that I met almost two years ago. Both of us were really nice with each other and we were pretty good friends at first, but my introverted mind did not help with that. After a while I started to have feelings for her and I started bringing up topics that did not concern her and was too awkward. I used to always text her almost every single day of every single hour to the point that she told my friend that I was annoying her (I knew that a couple of months later). I knew that something was up and that I made her upset but I never really knew what it was. I tried many different approaches to become her friend again but it all lead back to her thinking that I want to date her (she is not the type of person who would want to date at this age). After a year or so is when I figured out that I made her uncomfortable and gave her the notion that I wanted to talk to her only to date her and nothing else. I had an idea to confront her and apologize to her and tell her the truth of what I wanted from her but I keep having panic attacks and anxiety every time I think about doing it. What do you guys think I should do? Some might say that I should leave it behind, but I did such a horrible thing to such a great person and in all my life I have never met someone so true, genuine and wholesome in my life so I cannot give her up and make her feel this way about me.

Such as my husband's alcoholism, having a child (she is 18 months now) and returning to work. My doctor put me on Effexor 37.5 mg which has since increased to 75 mg. As a result I have had insomnia for past three weeks, I will try to take it before bedtime now as I was taking it in the morning, but I can sleep during the day but not at night??? My Supervisor did not want me returning to work while experiencing side effects ... the insomnia, nausea, dizziness, etc. I applied for short term disability and received a letter today stating I am not eligible for benefits based on diagnosis of depression and being put on medication!!!! Talk about depressing!!! oh, wait, I already was I have very low motivation, I don't feel like socializing or talking to anyone and some days I don't even want to go out of the house. I have to get up everyday though as I have to care for my daughter while husband works, even when I was working it was still me caring for our daughter and doing everything else around the house ... yes, I am resentful too. I have no thoughts of self harm or suicide, just very negative and unhappy all the time. I have found that the Effexor has made me more relaxed , less anxious and less irritable.

0,"The last few weeks I have slid back almost as far as before I started treatment. Just when I thought I was improving. I finally went to the drop in center called Sunshine Place, as someone was giving a talk on depression. The counselor spoke with me for about half an hour after her talk and said she thought I needed more help than my GP was giving. For the first time in a few months I actually broke down and cried again - which is very annoying to me. She wrote down the number of the Mental Health Center with some suggestions for them. I rang the next day for an appointment (and that was hard just to ring). She had told me I might have to wait a few weeks for them to see me, but they made an appointment for the next day. The psychiatirst there was okay (I didn't even cry like I normally do when talking to a new doc) but I told her I was tired of telling the same things to every new person. The short of it is they are changing me from Lexapro to Avanza and organizing for some CBT. I see my regular GP next Tuesday so I am pleased they said they would inform her of the medication change. I was also warned that I would probably feel a bit more depressed while the medication change was taking place; so I duly warned Mom and Matt not to take any notice of any strange behavior. Matt as usual just laughed and said ""yeah, Mom's going to go psycho"". Now I just wait for them to contact me about the CBT. If I don't answer any posts you'll know why, but I will try to just put a little emoticon up every now and then to let you know I am thinking of you all, and that I am still listening.

0,"I feel like nothing works or will work out, can someone relate? It‘s always like I try something and want to better myself, have high expectations and then life comes, uppercuts me, spits on me and just screams „You thought, bitch“. I had a really good therapist but she suddenly quit due to illness. I had to wait several months until I got the final answer. Had no therapy in that time between and also we only had like 6 sessions. Now I have a therapist who is ok but I just don‘t vibe with her that much. And I can‘t change because of insurance. Nor do I have the money to pay for one myself since I‘m a broke ass student. I told her once that I don‘t want solutions. I want someone to genuienly understand me. At first she tried and now it’s all solutions again. „Try this, try that, we need to experiment“. I get the thought but I feel like my deep down feelings are just irrelevant once again. My first therapist really understood me and listened. I could cry my heart out and afterwards I felt so much lighter. I really miss that feeling. Now it‘s just an obligation I have to do. Back then I never used to come late to my therapy sessions because I really looked forward to it. But now I am constantly running late because deep down, I just don‘t want to go anymore and give up. I don‘t have energy for that. I also took anti depressants (Tianeurax if anyone knows that one). At first it helped me, especially with processing feelings. But then I turned super suicidal and had mental breakdowns over mental breakdowns. I completly stopped and now I feel numb again. I want to feel suicidal and emotional again, to be honest. At least I processed something. Now I feel empty and dead inside once again, like how I used to be all the years before I started therapy and taking anti depressants. My „new“ therapist asked me what I can bear more. My suicidal state or this passive suicidal state. I told her the last one. But honestly, I want it to be the first one. At least I felt like a human. At least some people cared because they were afraid I‘d do something to myself. Now no one cares. I‘m alone. I don‘t go outside anymore. I‘m just isolating myself again. No one really talks to me and I‘m just a bother to everyone. I honestly think about taking my anti depressants again, just to get suicidal and off myself. Despite often being a bad actor, I am just so well at playing this role of „Of course, I will try! I will do my best“. I‘m good at pretending nothing bother‘s me and everything‘s fine. I‘m good at pretending to say „Wow, your advice helped me so much, thank you for listening!“. But I‘m just a fraud. Nothing helps. Afterwards I just want to die more. Sometimes I ask myself, why the hell do I even put up with all of this. The only reason why I haven‘t killed myself yet is because it‘d financially ruin my family. I don‘t even care about emotions, I doubt it‘d be that bad. No one likes me anyway. Just so they don‘t get into debt with my death or sth. I often find myself also thinking that I will never leave a goodbye letter or tell them goodbye. Because no one cares anyway. I told them many times before why I want to die. I don‘t feel like anyone deserves that anyway because they don‘t put as much energy into me as I put into them. Whenever I feel like it goes up, it just crumbles down. I really don‘t know how much of this I can take. I‘ve been like this since 6 years old. I‘m 21 now. I don‘t know why I got thrown into this world when I‘m ridden and infested with mental illnesses.

1,"My Story of Elder Abuse: Internet Romance Scams and the devastating consequences I'm living a nightmare watching a woman 50 years younger than my 80-year-old father coerce him into marriage, manipulate him and taking his money all in the name of ""love"". The relationship started as Ghanaian romance scam (usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/romance-scams/) and after we uncovered it was a male in Ghana pretending to be an American woman, it eventually led to a Ghanaian woman residing in Cuba, showing up at my father's doorstep and coercing him into marriage two weeks later. The story is long, complex, and out of this world so I won't go into it here. We've tried it all: FBI, USICE/immigration, State Dept., AARP, private investigators, the District Attorney, police, adult protective services, elder abuse attorney's and filing for conservatorship. The harsh reality I'm learning is though the crime is so blatantly obvious to everyone, I'm told over and over by the authorities that individuals have the right to abuse themselves. My father is showing serious signs of dementia but his executive functioning is still intact and we cannot get him to see a neuropsychologist without a long and painful court battle. To the outside world, he comes across as just fine, but my normally mild-mannered, extremely rational and brilliant father has had explosive and violent episodes, personality changes, impulsive behavior, and has been unduly influenced and taken advantage of over an over again. He cannot see that people are lying to him even though the lies are later revealed to him. I've had a huge reality check just how powerful civil liberties to make bad decisions are in the USA along with the financial rights that coexist in marriage, no matter how corrupt. I'm not writing for advice since I know in my heart my father is not well and is no longer the father I know and love. What I want to know is if anyone else out there has experienced elder financial abuse in their family, and romance scams or partner abuse in particular. I want to hear your story. I am appalled that though financial elder abuse is rampant throughout the USA, and internet romance scams are only on the rise, there seems to be no major initiatives or policies to protect our vulnerable elders. Thank you. ",seekingpeace01.txt

I tell my therapist nearly all of this shit and she helps me as best she can but there's only so much she's able to do. She has no magic way of instilling me with motivation. Like... to put it into perspective. I stared at a wall for 2 hours today. Because I just was to tired to anything else. 2 hours! I wasn't thinking about anything. I wasn't being bored. I just don't have motivation to do anything! But what's worse is the moment I start thinking again is the moment all the sadness washes over me.

I go through thousands of career tests and applications and all I see is that I'm either not interested enough or not good enough for any career. And I can't simply work for money. Money in and of itself just isn't good enough for me to work at a job I hate or am completely uninterested in. That's the strain of these minimum wage jobs, some of them I've had to quit because they've literally made me suicidal. I'm so lost right now.

Something that has recently taken my interest is the inferiority complex and how this affected my perceptions of things. I first got onto the idea through a page called Depression Hurts at a Hypnosis site 121 hypnosis (its worth plugging as I have found it useful). It took a while to admit to myself that I was afraid of not belonging, being criticized, sarcastic remarks at work etc and it stems back to horrid teachers and kids at school. This has been a turning point for me though - working through the false learnings and memories, so I thought I'd share it in case it resonates with anyone else.

1,"Should Social Security be run by the government? Is government good at doing that sort of thing? When I attended a student meeting with one of the chair's of the Fed (in NYC) he said that there are two things that the US has to worry about economically in the future. The first is the trade deficit turning over and the second is the retirement of the baby boomers. Now I read your (MWS) post to Joe Crow about SS' funding till 2040 but the best estimates I can find (the only economist I can find who says otherwise is Paul Krugman from the NYTimes, so maybe I'm off base since he's a superb economist) state that under the pay-as-you-go system within a dozen years the retirement benefits mandated by current law will exceed SS payroll taxes. So we're talking about tax increases within our (or at least my) lifetime (Fortune article called it The $44 Trillion Abyss).  Now, as you mentioned earlier, any serious student of human nature has to look at the world realistically. When you put a social safety net (just like free health care) in place, what's gonna happen? It will be overused...that is human nature unless people are given a clever incentive to do otherwise (I leave wiggle room here in case I’m forced to recant later). People are going to plan on using it, not everybody, not all the time, but those guys on the margin of making a decision on savings will tend to take this retirement benefit into account and, god forbid, plan on it. The system is going to HAVE TO handle the stress from the poor and disabled AS WELL AS the free riders. Now, that's not say that SS is altogether bad, socializing some costs is important, but the pay-as-you-go system is totally ridiculous! You get one guy who knows about accounting and one guy who knows about demographics in a room together and they'll tell you something's got to give: either taxes go up or benefits go down or a little of both. Maybe another variant would work better, but the most libertarians I meet get annoyed when their children’s futures are being taxed away before their eyes.

0,"[Need Advice] Need anti depressants but I don't want my mum to know about it. Hello guys, I am 17 and I live in Singapore with my Mum. I have been depressed on and off for the past 5 years with serious suicidal thoughts for the last 4. I really think that it's time that I start anti depressants because I reckon it would help me tons. The problem is, I don't want my mum to know because the last time I opened up about being slightly suicidal and very depressed, she freaked out on me (don't need to get into details.) She has had a history with it herself and I know that if i ever took my life, it would permanently ruin her. At this point, medication is my last resort. I've had a girlfriend and it made no difference whatsoever, I still feel empty most of the time and would rather die than anything else. I know that in Singapore you're able to consent medically when you're 16, but I'm not sure if i can possible get around her for meds like this without her knowledge/consent. Any help for my situation would be fantastic :) Thanks everyone ",ThrowawayHelpMe2018.txt
1,"Annoyed and I feel absolutely horrible about it My parents have recently recovered from some financial issues that caused them to move out of state. A little over a year ago, my father found a job back in the state where I currently live and has been staying at my place during the weeks when he works. As much as I love my parents though, sometimes I really struggle with sharing my limited space, i.e. a very small one bedroom apartment. What makes it even more difficult is the fact that I rarely ever know ahead of time when he's coming and when he isn't. And when he does come, he doesn't knock. He just walks right in using the spare key that I came home to find was gone (without first being asked if it was okay to take) a while back. It honestly makes me feel like I'm twelve again. I worked very hard to become independent and to have my own life and space and now... I don't. I hadn't even been on my own for a year when all of this started. I can't say anything about it because my mother always downplays it by saying, ""You'll be fine. We're family."" And the one time I even indirectly said something to my father, just by casually asking if he'd taken my spare key, I got a phone call from my mother saying that he was upset and essentially blamed me for them having to move to begin with. Long story short, I don't know what to do. I feel so terrible to be annoyed with the situation, but I am. ",infpproblems.txt

I have just started a new job after a year where I have been mostly doing nothing but having fun, meeting people and having a heartache. Heartache ? Yes, I kind of left my heart in Hong-Kong the last time I went there in December 2003. I stayed there for a month and a half and found out I really enjoy the life there.   Really I do, even if it is harder to leave in Hong Kong than in Lyon (France). Even if work is tougher, even if I would spend more time commuting, even if I would have less money.  I think like I belong there, I don't read nor write Chinese but I speak Cantonese. I kind of feel alive there.  Is it because each time I have been there was on vacation ? Maybe. Now I want to try the real life there.  I have to stop hesitating.   Last time I was there, I attended a wedding. This time, I will also attend a wedding of very close relatives.

She has 1 real friend and a sibling she’s close to, but aside from that she doesn’t get along with her family. She’s told me before I’m really all she has, but not in a desperate way (although I think it is that too). I don’t really know how to tell her or what to be cautious of because this is the first time I’ve dated someone like this.

1,"Hearing my parents doing naughty things at night scars me. Hey guys, my name is Sally. I'm seventeen this year and it's 5am right now at where I live. I don't know how to phrase my words as my head is in a mess. To provide some background story about myself, my family live in a compact flat and as a result, I sleep with my parents. In the bedroom, my parents sleep on the bed while I sleep on a mattress beside their bed. When I had nightmares when I was younger, I would squeeze in between them and only then, could I fall asleep. As I got older, when I would replicate doing the same thing when I had nightmares, I would get scolded instead. That's how the bed was - just enough for 2 adults and 1 kid-sized human, I guess? So I don't recall when - perhaps it was a year ago, when I heard the bed shaking continuously from my father's actions. He was also breathing heavily and there was this sticky sound too. Gross enough, I know. At that point of time, I was already mature enough to assume that he was masturbating. It was enough to scar me though, because it was just so strange to think of your dad fapping in the middle of the night, in the same room as his daughter. I pretended that I was asleep, but that was a really shitty experience tbvh. I tried to convince myself that he was doing something else, like rubbing his nose, and brushed it off. I just refused to accept that he might be doing something so dirty and it took me so many years of my life to actually realise it? What?! Alright so today, I found out that not only does my dad engage in that sort of behaviour, so does my mum. I'm shocked lol. I don't know how I should go about knowing this. I searched for some advice on Google too, and I now learnt that it's supposed to be 'normal'? Is it so common? I'm so shooked because I thought my family were a conservative bunch. I'm their youngest child, and I thought they would have stopped all perverted acts since I was born. So how did I find out? I suddenly woke up to hear my dad shaking the entire bed again. This time, I was really unaware and asked my dad to shut up. Suddenly, my mum nagged at me slightly and I was so confused. My mum went to the washroom and started showering? Which was so odd and made no sense. And from the corner of my eye, I saw my dad wearing his underwear and pants! He slipped them on so easily I thought it might have been a daily practice for them. He zipped up his pants naturally and it came as an instant realisation to me that both of them were engaging in some indecent shit. What. The. Actual. Fuck. I slept in the same room with them for 17 years, and today I found out that both of them have been doing messed up shit and I was completely oblivious, up until today. It's so scarring, and I remember myself pretending I'm asleep. I knew before that my mum didn't wear a bra to sleep, but I really didn't know it might be more than just because it was more comfortable to sleep without one. Lmao. I'm really shocked at how they are doing things like this while I'm asleep. In the same room. And my dad makes such obvious sounds, I think it's sick. The thought of it disgusts me. I heard somewhere before that all men fap, regardless their age. Is it true? I'm starting to feel crept out, that men are so hormonal LOL. I suddenly feel so pure and this entire thought of my parents being naughty is scarring asf. Thoughts, anybody? ",junnaquack.txt
1,"There are things running through my head today.  What should I do about my future.  I have a decent job, an apartment, a relationship, but  what do I want to do with my life?   There are many things I've wanted to do.  When I was in high school I wanted to be a broadcaster.  When I was in college, while things became less clear, I knew that I wanted to study English and Tudor history and combine them somehow or another.  Now that I'm out of school, all I want is to go back - to do something different; to be something more than what I am.    So, here are some things I've thought about doing.  I haven't really thought them through all the way, but that's what this sort of forum is for, right?    I've always wanted to write books.  Either researching stuff from the Elizabethan or early Tudor time period, or historical based romances or even just plain old fiction.  The problem is - what would I write about?  There are already tons of books about Elizabeth I, her sister Mary, her cousin Mary Stuart...it's a bit frustrating.  But, I suppose there's always room for a well researched, well written book out there.    I've thought about studying to become a teacher.  But, what would I teach?  English or History?  On what level would I teach?  I'm not the most patient person in the world...I'd hate teaching in an elementary school or even a middle school.  So, I guess that leaves high school and college levels.  I'd enjoy having the summers off, but probably not much else.  I'd love to be able to travel for 3 months out of every year.  Or even travel for 1 month and work the other 2 doing something else.  It's a possibility I guess I should look into.    The law has also fascinated me from a young age.  I'd love to be a lawyer.  I should look into law schools, at least to find out the requirements.    All in all, I think what I'm doing now is good for me - it's making me question what I   should  be doing and what I  could  be doing.  That's never a bad thing, is it?

Forget about the team winning, this guy wanted all the points for himself and didn't care about the team. I had to set him straight, and after the game I had to report him as being a trash player and set in my preferences to never see him again. After that I saw the other players and they were all nice.

The moment I realized that my mental illness was ""real"" was coming to the conclusion that well-adjusted people do not think about killing themselves on a regular basis. And with that, came my wake up call to get help.. ",Smthkayla.txt

1,"Fourth of July: It was kinda boring for me. A few of Rachel's friends came over and we shot off some big fireworks that my daddy bought. It was alright I guess. Wow, okay now onto these last 2 days. I had to wake up at 5:30 in the morning on Monday to get ready to go to my Grandparents' house(which is in Branson--4 hours away). On the way we got McDonald's breakfast(because that's the only meal they can make that is good enough to choke down.) We got to their house at around noon. We came in and talked for a little bit, then we watched the tape of my promotion and from dance camp. Then we sat. And talked. And sat. And ate. And sat. Then my dad and grandpa went outside to unload firewood and they forced me to help them. Okay, I'm not the type of girl that goes out in the woods and loads firewood into a 30 year old Ford truck, but I did it just because I'd rather do that than sit inside and talk to my grandma, lol. When we were unloading it onto the stack of firewood that was already there, I got bit by an ant. It hurt like hell, so I went inside to put aloe vera on it. I checked my phone and saw that Kierston had called me, so I called her back. We ended up talking for the next half hour until my family came back inside and then we ate spaghetti for lunch. After lunch, Rachel and me went outside and rode the four-wheeler for a little while. Then I came back inside and called Cam and we talked until he had to go to baseball. We ate mac and cheese for dinner and then we watched TV for a little bit. Then I called Kier again cause I was bored and we talked for a little while. Then I came inside again and got ready for bed. I figured I should go to bed early since old people wake up early. The next day, my dad came in and woke me up at 9. I was soo mad. So I got up and ate breakfast, then went back to sleep till about noon or 1. My phone was dead, so I couldn't call anyone, unfortunately. We talked again for like an hour or whatever and then we left. On the way home we stopped by IHOP and I got some chocolate chip pancakes. And we got home late last night and I got on AOL, watched TV, the usual. Went to bed at like 3, woke up today at 12. Today Colton came over to see Rachel.

0,"My story, i have to get this off my chest. Life sucks Hello everyone, This is a post about my life basically, i just need to get this off my chest. Its a long post but i just have to do this. Let me introduce myself first. Currently im a 19yo boy who turns 20 in March, I live in Belgium (grammar will be bad sorry). I have 1 older brother,  2 loving parents who are still together. And oh yeahh i have a very cute pupper as well. Financially everything is fine. Basically a family some people only can dream for. I mainly play on nintendo consoles (switch, 3ds, gba, n64) and the MMORPG runescape (dont laugh :)) I consider myself a extravert to my friends but an introvert when im talking to girls (lol) or strangers. I've always had a rough time fitting at school. Our elementary school was VERY SMALL, it only had 75 kids (including kindergarden). I was always the ""odd one out"", but because it was so small i had 1 friend. We played alot together and it was a ok time really. but when i was 5 most people around me started to notice that i made weird random noises. And that i made small movements with my shoulders (unnatural ones). Friends got annoyed, parents got annoyed, everyone got annoyed. Eventually my teacher screamed at me telling me to shut up, RIP ME. Eventually mom took me to a specialist and it turned out i have Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, if you youtube this you will get extreme cases where people shout fuck and ass, and move uncontrollably all over the place. THIS IS NOT THE CASE WITH ME. I think Tourette affected my life ALOT (it still does!!). I was always a really shy kid until i was 11, i started to accept my tourettes and was a happy 11yo. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **HIGH SCHOOL** (from 12 to 18yo, its devided in 6 ""classes"". This is where the problems started, when i just started high school i was scared but excited like everyone. Unfortunately for me i got the SHITTIEST bullies in my class. I had no friends in year 1, they made fun of me becuz of my tourettes (i didnt tell them becuz they wouldnt understand). It got to a point where i just smacked someone on the head with a baseball bat. Teachers knew of my situation so we both got 1 week detention. I was ""depressed"" during that year, you know the teenage life, its hard. Year 2 they changed me to another class and they were OK. They didnt bully me but they didnt talk to me either. They just left me alone really, during those 2 years i had 1 friend who i talked with but he also had his own friends. So most of the time i was alone. But that friend had no common interests, so i ended up playing runescape all day, u can talk with other players there and i had plenty of friends in there. It felt awesome to have friends and i spent all my time there neglecting my studies. But somehow i passed  the first 2 years lol. I thought year 1 was bad, but then i met year 3 (different school). I got bullied even more in this class, they called me names, ignored me, humiliated me in class and started bitching if they had to sit next to me. Luckily they never got fysical with me (idk if thats the right word). In the middle of that year I decided in the middle of the fucking winter (it was snowing) in morning to take the bus (mom was always home and it was near our house) and to step of early. Spent 2 hours in a small freezing cold chapel playing on my nintendo 3ds, go to my house after mom left and spend playing games in my room. After 3 days the school called, my mom found out. I was stuck and told her everything about the bullying, about me feeling like absolute shit and that i had no motivation to go to school. She let the teachers know, went to school, got me to a psychiatrist. The bullying stopped, but they still ignored me, i still hadnt any friends and i still didnt feel any better. I somehow survived the 4 next months and passed. If i had 1.1% lower in total i would have failed that year. The only way i felt better was with playing runescape. YEAR 4-6 IS IN THE SAME CLASS WITH THE SAME PEOPLE, in year 5 three people joined Year 4 kinda went the same as year 2 believe it or not. The classmates were ok, they didnt bully me, they talked to me when needed but that was it. I spent my time with some kids i met on the playground. But u know they were those kind of friends u just spent time with becuz nobody else is around. They never invited me to go to parties or to hang around or anything. This year was also the 1st year i told them about my Tourette Syndrome ( i got some damn weird looks at times and i didnt even realize i was making sounds). They understood, they acted more nice to me, i didnt feel left out so much but was still unhappy. And on runescape i got into a community (clan), made some good friends there. It was the only place in the word i was truly happy. Year 5, same class as last year. 3 people joined and 1 of them became a friend of mine. To be completely honest he is still one of my best friends today, but i come back to that later. Lets call him J, Ok so now i had a friend. We had a small group of 3 people now, S (other classmate who was nice to me), J and me. 2 others from another class joined the group somehow and i finally made some friends. We started going to parties and they invited me. Unlucky for me they dont play runescape and have different interests in gaming, thanks to this im not that close to them. But i was finally starting to be happy becuz i had friends. All the small things that bothered me (sitting alone, always last chosen at sports etc etc...), bothered me alot less becuz i was super happy i finally found something positive in my life. I survived year 5 and 6 fairly positive compared to year 1 and 3. We all graduated and college time arrived ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **COLLEGE** This was last year, so this is super recent. I decided to study ""orthopedagogie"", it doesnt have an english translation. Its working with mentally disabled people or troubled young people, stuff like that. Ofcourse I begged my parents for a student room, i wanted to have a great college life like in the movies! Everyone says its the best time of your life and you should enjoy it to the fullest. Oh boy i was so so dumb for believing it would be that easy. And ofcourse i also joined a society. Finally growing up like an adult and living alone, I WAS FREEEEEEEEEEE. In my class i got along with most of them, we had some good laughs during breaks, went to our class etc... but i was the only one who had a student room (unlucky). So ye that was that. In my society i tried making friends, but it didnt work out really. I missed some first important parties becuz i decided to go with some classmates (i still think to this day that this was a huge mistake), when i went to parties alone to make friends  (because i realized my class was lame) they already a ""friend group"". I didnt know (and still dont) how to make contact with them and make friends. I was really really really lonely last year, i just spent all my time playing runescape, talking with my online friends. November 2016 i met someone and we became super super super super close. (he is american, not lovers just friends). We still talk to each other everyday. Man we even were planning to go to japan together but my mom wont let me. But coming back to that later. During the weekends i had my old friend group from highschool, we still hang out 2x per month, we still do. But they mostly spent time studying and hanging out with their uni friends. They didnt left me out or anything but i had lost alot of contact with them. I failed 50% of my courses, i decided to call it quits. I was happy that i could finally leave that student room. uni year 1 was HORRIBLE. I liked the study i was doing, so i decided to try it again but in a lower degree, its in a school for adults (18+). Its hard to explain but basically i ended up with 60% out of 20 people to be 30+ and have kids. It was class 1x a week and internship (idk if thats the right word) 2.5 days per week. I was working with adults who had a mental disability. Last year i never had internship, only class. It turns out that Orthopedagogie is not the study for me. I dont want to do this the rest of my life. I had officially quit november 2017. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We finally arrived to the present time, thank you for the people that made it here. So here i am, a 19 year old boy (almost 20), wasted 1.5 years in uni, wasting parents money... I have no idea what i want to study next... The only study i consider doing is social work, luckily for me u can start in february. So i have to do some shitty job from november - february. I still have my highschool friends who i hang out with 2x per month? I have a loving brother and parents, good financial situation. I can earn some quick cash for 3 months and go back to study. But to be completely honest... I DONT SEE THE FUCKING POINT. My whole life i have felt lonely, sometimes with a good reason, sometimes really without a reason. I have dealt with ""depression"" (not officially diagnosed), or atleast felt like i was. To be completelty honest. I feel like a sad little fucking sack of shit. What have i achieved in my life? Fucking nothing. I cant even think like a fucking normal person, people think im weird, i dont have logical sense. Everyday i have to force myself out of bed. Its been like this for so long now that im starting to get used to it. Even now that i dont have a job until feb, i simply dont have the strength to get out of bed. I sleep 12 hrs per day just so the day passes by faster. I dont feel like going out, i dont feel like talking to people. Runescape was always my escape, but i simply do not have the motivation to even play runescape . On the outside i still act normal, i laugh and act like everything is fine so my parents wont worry. Whenever i have a job they fire me because ""i work to slow"". Once i worked in a storage for a store and had to get the order from customers. You have to use ""common sense"" all the time, and they said i didnt have that enough for this job. This happened 3x... Remember when i said that i have tourette syndrome, well i always told myself that it also does have a ""mental"" side to it. I can come across different then the ""normal person"", or use the wrong word in sentences to express myself. And i interpret things differently at times, i usually need to hear the explanation multiple times and they have to explain it very clearly. My parents just said im a slow learner but with ""hard work i get there"". This fucked me over so many times in life, and whenever i tell people/friends about the mental side of tourette they all have that expression on their face. The face of ""ohh that explains alot, but i also feel so sorry for you"". Im so fucking sick of it, im not even sure if this happens becuz of my tourette. Im really starting to think this is just all in my head and that im just retarded. (my iq is average tho). I often imagine myself having some disorder to make myself feel better, i really dont know what to do with myself. I feel like an absolute loser who cant even think like a normal person. Last 6 months i bought myself a nintendo switch + some games to cheer myself up. it gets me trough some days but in the end i still end up having no energy to get out of bed. BUT i feel like an arrogant asshole writing this, i have nothing to complain about... Alot of people had the worst childhood, or had a traumatic experience... I have a family many people can only dream of? financially im good. I have the chance to try studying again.... I HAVE NO REASON TO FEEL THIS WAY AND IT MAKES ME GO INSANE. Im having alot of negative thoughts, and i cant get them out of my head. I dont see the light in the end of the tunnel. (Not stuff like suicide or self cutting btw). As i said earlier i met someone a year ago trough rs. I can always talk to him, i never met him in person but we discord at times and message each other everyday. I feel more connected to him than my IRL friends. They have no same interests, other life goals... How sad is that? Fkn someone i met online is my best friend? He is the only 1 that knows how i feel but he doesnt understand how i feel. He tries to support me, but it doesnt help. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Im not making this post so everyone feels bad for me.... Im just so sick of life... I dont know what to do... My parents have their own problems and think im over exaggerating... ""Grow up son? Everyone has to get a job"" ""Grow up for once"". But they dont know what it feel like to drag yourself trough the whole day 24/7 (atleast i hope they dont). They think im just lazy and dont want to work... I feel isolated from the world and i cant get out of it. Ok god damnit im re-reading this post, at this point im just rambling... Idk what i expect from posting this here... Maybe its just to give my empty brain a boost... I will just end this post now or i keep adding stuff. EDIT: i have no clue how to get the text all the same size ",everything3d.txt
1,"Some days I feel so bloody old. It's the way I remenisce over old times and experiences I had when I was younger. And I think it's the fact that I do this so oftern is what makes me feel like a bit of a dinosaur. Maybe I'm being overly aware of the changes that have occurred over the last few years. I'm 26 and that's really nothing in the scheme of things. But I had such a crazy time from 16-22, 23 that I can't help but sometimes feel in awe of the times I've had.  I imagine alot of us go through it but I seem to be the only who keeps talking about it.  I think I'm a narcissist. I think I think about what I think about way too much. Am I overly concerned with the way I perceive myself? Why do I always have to feel ""good"" about every situation. Even when I'm with a person, when we part I always feel the need to make the parting ""smooth and clean"".  No awkward goodbyes and whatnot. But then I think that because I'm already anticipating the situation that makes it awkward. Anybody else ever feel like that?  Why do I always have to find the things that I think are wrong with me and then make a strategy of how I""m going to combat and resolve those inequities? How good it would feel to say: I'm selfish, I smoke too much pot, I'm cheap, I always need things to be 'even'  AND THAT'S HOW I AM. DONE. No plan, no outline to correct my traits gone awry. I bet people live like that. It must be fucking great! And very freeing....  We took grandma out for lunch today to celebrate her 78th birthday. I wrote on her card: P.S. You don't look a day over 50!!  I thought it was rather clever and tongue in cheek for a variety of reasons. In fact I thought it funner to say 50 as opposed to 20 seeing as 20 is such a stretch it's not conceivable. Either way i don't think grandma got it. ""oh, we better not let anyone see this"" was her response. Shit, then I felt like an asshole and even when were at lunch I kept thinking about how uncool it was, and I couldn't shake the feeling that everything wasn't perfect and smooth. Aya.

My medication has changed lately; my body hasn't caught up the difference yet. The last few days have been particularly bad, especially at night. The familiar sensation lurks again on my upper leg. Scissors. Half-dozen lines -- my usual, though in the past I would sometimes keep cutting until my self-hatred was momentarily spent. Pressure on the blade to force the skin to gape slightly and bleed more. I am not proud. I knew it wasn't the best way to cope. I did at least take the precautions of using a sharp blade, knowing that a jagged blade could leave a jagged wound, and of lavish aftercare. I washed it out with rubbing alcohol, which causes renewed bleeding but was necessary to keep everything clean and infection-free. Covered everything with a jumbo Band-Aid, the kind kids put on skinned knees, and haven't dared to look since. Afterward, I was afraid that I was back to my old ways. I told myself in near-hysterics that this was strictly a one-time backslide. The surprising part is that I believed myself. This does not make me a cutter again. This does not mean that I have lost everything that I've gained. All it means is that I have been having an extraordinarily bad time and resorted to extraordinary behavior in order to cope. My situation will improve. My body chemistry will even out. It's better not to cut, but I am not a bad person even if I do cut. The words are stupidly simple. I don't care.

It'll be like heaven.  Except . . . I'm hoping I don't become a hermit.  Someone at work today joked that I'll be a cat lady.  I won't buy a cat -- I promise!!!  Hopefully it won't be so bad.  My current roommate will still be relatively close (she and her fiancee are moving in together).  My cousin will moving (with his wife) to a condo VERY close to my new place -- that'll be pretty nifty, cause I think we might be good friends -- we've never lived close enough to try before, but I've always enjoyed hanging out with him (and his wife) when I've gotten the chance.  Oh -- and I'll moving close to some friends-of-a-friend that I'm decently good friends with, too (and that I've always wanted to be better friends with).  So hopefully it'll all turn out well.  And it's a damn cute apartment  :-) ",3716366.200407020.female.25.txt
1,"Hey Levi thanks for helping me figure this whole thing out, mad props bud!   This is how I feel You don't know me, so dont talk about me! I know what happened, I was there and you weren't! He is saying that I keep calling and bugging him, but I'm not. You didn't here the things that he said to me and you don't know the way he made me feel. He was my good friend, He could tell me anything, problems with his girlfriend or school, I could also tell him anything, I thought that I could trust him. I was wrong. He told you lies so that way he could be cool and I would be a fool. So this is how I feel. Right now I'm not thinking about what we could have had, Because you are not worth it. Why would I want someone who tells lies? Why would I want someone that can't respect me?

1,"Coursemate [19F] wants me [18F] to find potential housemates, has high demands but i’m doing all the work :/ So at uni it’s time for students to be looking for a house to rent for the next academic year. Usually people live with friends they’ve made and such or just go on facebook and join groups. The place we’re interested in is a 6 bedroom house, I personally wouldn’t mind an all female house or with 2 boys and 4 girls idc. But my coursemate said she’d prefer 3 girls and 3 boys. Well so far we have 4 confirmed girls (me, coursemate and a girl that SHE found), i’m currently getting enquiries from girls and a few guys but if i’m doing this on a first come first served basis, it’s looking to be an all girls house. She made me look for the house, call the agent, book an appointment, put an ad on facebook.... She said that she has some anxieties doing some of this which i guess i  can understand bc sometimes i have bouts of social anxiety that i can’t help so i am a little sympathetic... But she’s being very demanding, i couldn’t look at any houses over the weekend bc i was with my boyfriends meeting his parents and his family so i couldn’t drop all that and go on my laptop doing all of this !! If i tell her that it’s looking to be an all female house with maybe one guy, i’m a little scared to know her reaction... But then again, she’s made me do all this work and yet would have to audacity to complain ?! I feel like she has a certain demographic in her head of what kind of boys she’d like in the house (she’s a lesbian so it’s not like that) ... idk ... I’m not sure what to do or say... shall i accept the girls that are actually willing to pay and be proactive or decline their offers JUST because my mate “wants boys”🙄? **TLDR** friend and i need to look for a house with other ppl for next year, she’s making me do ALL the work, is demanding and wants some boys to live with us.

1,"OMG it is so hot and humid! Today was this || close to being absolutely horrible, but there was one saving grace, and I'll save that for the end of this post. So, today I realized the full extent of the work I have to do (and should be doing now, but its too fucking HOT to stay focused) and have not done. All of my classes where boring as hell, History was the usual blend of note taking and sitting around with nothing to do, but today it was like a sauna (this is not good). I skipped Chem. to go have lunch with Tegan, which was really fun ;-), this would be the saving grace I mentioned. After finally saying ""bye"" to her *sigh*, I booked it back to Elmira to make it to class only about 5 min late for Physics. Again it was like a sauna in that class, even with the windows open, and we watched a movie and worked on the project I left at home in my rush to meet Tegan on time. So effectively did nothing. English was the same except the whole class didn't do any work, even Mr. Miessner didn't seem like he wanted to do work so he just let us talk all class. That class was productive, gossip wise, because I found out some interesting things about Chadder's ex. which I found quite funny.

0,"I am new here. I'm from Australia, I'm 27 years old next month, married with a 2.5 year - old daughter and a baby son on the way. I work in Insolvency (liquidations etc). I have been on antidepressant medication on and off for about 4 years now (initially Aropax, now Aurorix), in hindsight I have actually suffered from depression for my entire life. I'm a similar personality to my mother who also suffers from depression. My younger brother and sister seem to have drawn the long straw as such, they seem not to be affected. Things went downhill for me about the time I started on medication. I was in the early stages of a major gambling problem, and untreated depression had led to a real strain on my marriage. We split up for 3 months (during which time I made 2 lame suicide attempts), reunited and seemed to get back on track, having our first child. Throughout this time the gambling problem intensified, and spiraled out of control to the point where I am now a bankrupt. During this time I also became extremely withdrawn to the point where I hate leaving our house and am more or less unable to cope with spending time with anyone except my wife and daughter. I also had something of a breakdown about 9 months ago, quit my job, which led to great tension between me and my wife (spending 24 / 7 together), eventually she could not cope and moved out. Shortly after we worked it out and I moved in with her. Things seem pretty good now, we are a lot more relaxed about things and we just seem to get along better, looking forward very much to the birth of our second, in about 6 weeks time. My gambling problem is pretty much dealt with (thanks chiefly to having little money and no access to it now) but I am still depressed, withdrawn and generally tired of life. To be honest, I am only around because of my wife and daughter, I feel little reason to exist other than for them. I am also a christian and this is very hard, because there is a real burden of ""I shouldn't feel this way, I should be happy"". This leads to more depression, and at the moment I am reluctant to go to church, I don't pray or read the bible. I'm generally resentful of anyone who I consider to have a better existence than me (which is just about everyone). So while things are quite stable at home, I personally am at my lowest point in some respects. I am quite intelligent and every employer I have ever had has commented on my abundance of potential but lack of drive. So true, I lack any kind of ambition (and harbor something of an extreme opposition to materialism and the pursuit of money and possessions) and even now am tossing up whether to continue working. I have a chief interest (i.e. motorsport), but other interests have been decimated e.g. I used to be quite a good pianist but now have absolutely no desire to play. I also can't get the motivation up to get involved in playing sport, which in the past has been a big part of my life. So that's me in a nutshell. My extreme difficulty in taking on face to face help / relationships has driven me to get involved in some online depression forums as I think this may be a good way for me to start some kind of recovery.

0,"Hi all, I've just registered here... I've been depressed for quite a while, my dad died when I was 7 and my best friend died when we were 18. After the death of my father I was in counseling, but my counselor stopped coming to school to see me and I don't think I ever got anywhere from it. I'm currently 23, almost 24 (and male, from the UK for those keeping count) I've felt crap for ages... I hate my job, and doing that along with the stress of my final year of university sent me on a downward spiral. I would worry so much about my workload, but have no motivation to do it and get out of the situation. I hate being single, but can't find someone special who likes me, who I like back. I want to leave my job, but I can't afford to until I leave university and get a job doing something I want to. I had thought about suicide, but I know the pain of losing people close to me, and I couldn't inflict that pain on someone else. I considered cutting myself too. I thought that maybe if I was hurt, I could get extra time for university work, and maybe someone would help me. But I realized that I shouldn't do that, and should see someone about it. I also didn't have the balls to do it. I think bad thoughts a lot but I don't think I could go through with them. I was worried about going to the doctor though. My previous experience with a counselor has put me off them, and I don't like talking to strangers about my problems - that said I don't like telling people I know either because I feel that they will judge me. I was also concerned about medication because I don't know if I like the idea of chemicals altering my brain (apart from alcohol that is!) But about 3 weeks ago I finally went to see my doctor. He has put me on 20mg of Fluoxetine a day, although I'm not sure whether it is doing much. I've been having headaches and going a bit dizzy as well as getting sleepy (among other side effects). It's weird though, I don't know whether I'm feeling better or not, my friends say I seem different and better for taking it but I still feel bad at times... I still lie in bed at night worrying. But I think maybe I need to take it more and see how it effects me long term. I guess even on medication we all have good days and bad days. I was scared to tell my mother that I was on anti-depressants, as she works in mental health. Some would see this as a blessing as she understands the field to a great degree, but I was worried because I thought that she might think I was mad. I eventually got the courage to tell her after about 5 days though because I was very dizzy and I thought that she would suspect me of being on illegal drugs. She is being very supportive now, while still keeping enough distance that I don't feel like she's worrying too much about me. It's good to know that she understands that it's going to help me cope though... and she says its only a minor drug compared to what some of her patients take to stop the voices telling them to do things. Anyway I decided to look for somewhere online where other people know what it feels like, and I am glad that I've found this place. I hope I can make some new friends here, and maybe I can help a couple of people too. ",diluted_e_1_a_1_uk.txt

0,"Here's a new update for interested readers. Bad news first: I got a voicemail last week, it said my mother was in the hospital. It took me awhile to get more info, I called and left a message where she lived because it was too late to get anyone on the phone there. I finally found out where she was and called the hospital. They said she was having problems walking, that maybe she hurt her back. That she was getting breathing treatments because she had trouble breathing. Part of it was she couldn't smoke, part of it was probably because she does smoke. They didn't seem to find out what caused the problem with her legs. Then she had some other stuff wrong. Part of the good news was one thing they thought was wrong was caused by a shot they gave her, and it was solved the next day. Now, I called her Friday and she said her heart test showed a tear in a valve. She is getting a more detailed test next week, the doctor said it is too early to tell how serious it is or if it needs anything done to it. He told her, it could be just something minor that needs to be monitored and could cause no problems at all or it could require heart surgery. So I was very worried about that. My first thought when I heard she was in the hospital was that she would end up having cancer from smoking, or liver disease from drinking. But I didn't think of any heart problems. I am hoping that it won't be anything serious, or that if she needs surgery that it will be successful and she will recover without any complications. I don't know much about heart surgery, I know I've heart that many bypass patients have good surgery but get sick and die from complications after the surgery. I hope and pray that she will be ok, I live far from her and can't do anything but call her and pray. Now some good news, my new job is going to switch me to fulltime hours next week. I still have to find out if it will be temporary or long-term, but I'm happy either way. I went from poor and going to be homeless, to having a place to live and a low-stress job in a short time. Each day I wake up and am alive and have a place to live means a lot to me now. It kind of gives me a better perspective on life in a way. I know so many people have it worse, so much suffering in the world and I'm lucky. I have to get some new clothes because changing to fulltime I have to go by a different dress code, so I'll be looking for cheap nice clothes tomorrow. I'm thankful I have some money to look for clothes. I'm still adjusting to things, sometimes I feel like ""where am I, what's going on?"" but it is better than before when I was at my apartment thinking ""when will I get kicked out, where will I live?"" I'm trying to take it one step at a time, not worry about where I'm supposed to be going in life. I'm thinking, what do I need, get things stable, be able to support yourself, get a phone, get car insurance, get more hours at work etc... I try to stay positive and be grateful, but still I'm a little lost. If anyone wants more details about things, or advice on how I've coped with anything just leave a reply and I'll answer you. I have a lot of things I've learned and advice, but I don't go around telling people what to do or pushing my point of view. I try to just express myself without pushing. ",raven_e_1_b_1_us.txt
0,"I'm a 23 year old female who has suffered from depression for the last 3 years. I remember having bouts of it in high school, hating myself and thinking i was ugly and worthless, but it generally passed and things got better. Then all of a sudden when i was 20, i just started crying constantly, feeling out of control, wanting to dig a hole and bury myself, not knowing what to do with myself, feeling hysterical. I went on medication after a few months, and things improved, but it's something i still deal with every day. I am at university full time, as well as working part time, and just feel like i'm constantly on the edge of going insane. I just moved to a new city, and feel so lonely, wanting attention but i feel like no one's interested. Worst of all, i miss so much university (because i can't get out of bed in the morning) that my tutors regard me as a bad student, which makes me feel so bad, because i know i'm smarter than most of the people in our class. I just want everyone to know i'm not lazy and boring, i just feel like my body is made of lead and i have no energy and no drive to get up in the morning. I have just started seeing a psychologist and she is really great, but it's so expensive i have to work extra shifts at work just to manage, which makes me even more stressed out! I don't want to take time off university because i took last year off and it made me feel worse. I really love my course and it's pretty much the only thing that gives me joy ...  if only i could get out of bed to go! i'm so angry at myself, my life wasn't meant to be like this...

0,"I Just Want to Feel Normal I’ll try to make this as short as possible, I swear.... And please bear with me. I know this is overwhelming and a lot is jumbled, but I have no other outlet.... I’m so tired of living. I’m not suicidal by any means, and I’m not talking about ending my life or anything, but I’m so TIRED of living in the mental state that I’m in. I can’t afford a therapist, and the ones that have been recommended because they work with your income are awful.... My depression didn’t hit until after my first child was born almost three years ago. Since then, I have been a WRECK, but have gotten much MUCH better over the course of the years. I’ve been on Celexa (60mg) for about a year which helped tremendously, but had to do away wth it once I hit my third trimester of this pregnancy (I’m currently 21 weeks). ALL OF THESE SYMPTOMS happened before I got pregnant a second time, and have been intensified since becoming pregnant... —I’m constantly moody. My emotions change with the drop of a hat. —I’m constantly wondering why my husband stays with me (he is a GREAT GREAT supporting, caring lover) and am always thinking he deserves better —I hate waking up on the weekends because I feel like I have no purpose (my almost-three year old is pretty easy to manage despite being rambunctious) —I am too self conscious to even get out and do something if I know the place I want to go to will be crowded —I have NO motivation to do anything. Walking to get some fresh air? Nope. Getting out of the house just for a moment to change scenery? Not a chance. —Everything that I try to do I have NO attention span to continue. Ive tried reading, cross stitching, writing, adult coloring books, ANYTHING to make my life seem more interesting and pleasurable....and I just can’t stick to anything. I’m sorry. I know this post is all over the place. I don’t even know where to start. I just wish that I had SOMEONE to talk to to set me straight Nd to encourage me.

1,"My family is a disaster Hello, I'm a 17 year old girl, and I'm tired of living. My father and my mother hate each other deeply, my father works and my mother is a housewife, recently they divorced, and both want custody of me and my siblings. My father constantly says that my mom steals money from him (he stills has to mantain us and her), and that she is a bad person that the only thing that wants is the house where we live in. My mother says that he never gives her anything (yet we live very well because he takes care of us all the time) and that when she doesn't have money for making lunch is because he didn't gave her the money and that he is making us believe that she is bad just so we go with him. I don't know who to believe I love them both. On the other hand, my father is always scolding us because of my little sister, who is always treating us badly, but when we deffend from her she is the victim. Today she told my father everything about the secrets I told her, about how sometimes I want to die, and all the thoughts I trust her, she just told them because we were having a little fight, I couldn't even tell hers because I didn't dare to. My father ended up scolding me and saying I don't value anything, and that I should stop being such an awful person, that I was one of those woman who everyone hates, just because I decided to deffend myself from her, and that SHE was the one being treated badly. My dad says always such hurtful things to me, he says that a career in music is useless and he isn't going to cost it, but when I told him I wanted to work to have my own money he just didn't let me... I want to be independent so I don't have to respect him all the time, I want to have my life, I want to be happy away from here, even if it mean not having much money, as long as I have music everything will be okay, is the only thing that calms me. I love my mother, even though too religious and hates my music, she is loving and she always says that if she had money she would pay any career I wanted, and even though my father is very cruel sometimes and wants me to study law, I love him too, I don't know how to get away from here, if I can't I don't know what should I do, who should I choose. I want to work and stop being obedient and afraid of my dad, everytime I think about how can I tell him that I don't agree with what he's doing I'm afraid, because he is the one giving me everything I have. He yells at me when I deffend myself from my sister, when I told him I wasn't going to stop listening to metal he yelled at me, also when I tell him that I won't stop loving music. He thinks he is untouchable, that everything he says is the right way, and that if I don't calm down then he will treat me even worst. HELP ME PLEASE. ",ailicearyam.txt

I started having problems with other friends family and uni like 3 months ago. Basically a depressive state. And i started to treat this friend badly during these months. Sometime i would realize it and go ""sorry i've been treating you bad for the last couple of days because of etc etc"" And she always went it's okay i can understand you. For the last 2 weeks i realized that she started ignoring my texts and stuff. I waited 5 days for a reply to a single text. At the end i got mad and texted her again saying ""I don't know what to think of you anymore"" Then she replied to that with a long text blaming me for stuff and how i've changed, how we didn't get to know each other properly etc. and a few other stuff that she got completely wrong idea of. I replied with a long message explaining everything to her but she didn't reply to it. We haven't talked for a week. Today i wrote a handwritten letter to her and im planning to send it to her tomorrow. It's a 3 page long letter explaining how sorry i am, how i ruined stuff and telling how much i love her and how much i want her to forgive me.

0,"I was rejected &amp; I feel great Last night I asked a close friend of mine on a date and was rejected, but strangely enough I don't feel dejected but rather proud and accomplished. To provide some background, I'll be turning 20 on the 15th, and last year, just 4 days after my 19th birthday, I was diagnosed with Persistent Depressive Disorder. This disorder is characterized by long lasting, essentially uninterrupted periods of depression lasting AT LEAST 2 years, and in many cases, such as with myself, far longer. To provide a rough estimate, I have been depressed somewhere around a total of 13 years of my life. The depression has had a serious negative affect on my love life, at times making me cold and even cruel. The most egregious example of this was when, after having dated this girl for a few months, I stopped talking to her almost entirely and started flirting with other girls. Eventually she had to get her friend to break up with me on her behalf because I was refusing to talk to her. At the time, because of the depression, I thought little of myself, seeing myself as a worthless scumbag, and so I started acting like one. I was also afraid to open up to some else, so instead I became emotionally cold and avoidant. I hated this behavior in myself, and held a deep guilt for how I had treated women I had been with, so about 5 years ago I stopped dating entirely. Despite being rejected, having finally had the confidence and self respect to ask out a woman and accept the no graciously is a major growth in my self esteem and wellbeing, so having done so I feel a great sense of accomplishment. This has really helped boost my self esteem and confidence, even though I was rejected. There's no real point to this story, but I just wanted to get this out there, because I'm really proud of the progress I've made so far. ",mojotrain.txt
1,"My father may have been a monster after all... I’ll try to make this as short as I can I am a 32/F both my parents have passed my mom as recently as 12/2016. My father was up in age when I was born. My mom was wife number 5 and much younger. So when he passed in 2013 it was sad but he lived till his nineties. My parents each had two kids from previous marriages that are much older then me. My mom got sick and then was dying for a year. I was her caregiver 100% and she lived with me. I worked two jobs had no days off and was a P/T nanny as well. Which made her so happy to have in the house cause she loved babies. My bro and sister are human garbage. They did nothing for her when she was dying, made life horrible for me, disliked my care for her just all around horrible people who pushed me to the brink of suicide. I cut all ties when she died moved to another part of the state and got a promotion. I’m doing alright now and it’s only been a little over a year. So now I had a brother from my dads marriage but he died in a car wreck in 07. My sister from my dads side is all the family I have left. I love her dearly but she has mental issues that are severe. Depression, schizophrenia, anxiety. We live in different states and I tried to get her to move to my state and she Wont she likes where she is. She lives independently and goes to a day program so she manages ok. Recently she has been upset at my cutting ties with my half siblings her step siblings. I told her I would have no problem with her continuing contact but I would not. Hell my cunt of a shitty sister tried to borrow money from her the majority of the times she called her but still I can’t stop her she is a 50yr old woman. But now my fragile sister is starting to not do well she is recalling abuse from when she was a teen. Gang rape at 13 multiple rapes in high school etc.  and she said our dad did nothing and noticed nothing Now I know this could be her illness at play but....I think I believe her.  She got sick or I should say her schizophrenia came to the front lines in her early 20s after she graduated college and had a pretty damn good job. I wasn’t even born yet but my mom was in the picture. (My mom and her were very close) When my sister had her breakdown she described horrible rape and  abuse in the middle of delusions and episodes. My mom said my dad thought it was her sickness but as my mom put it the way she described it happening it originated somewhere. Whether delusions morphed her memories my mom thought it happened to her. So now this sister only has me to vent to. I tried to call her case manager but as she is an adult and hasn’t been hospitalized in decades she won’t let me speak to her. I’m going to call her day program and try to speak to someone about her seeing a rape counselor or something along wit her regular treatment. In a way I don’t want to deal with something this heavy again and I know that’s selfish I lost years of myself helping care for my dying father then 100% for my mom I was pushed to the brink of my own sanity And then there is the fact that I think my father did do nothing. I was his favorite and I know I was. He never hit me and my mom but he was verbally abusive. But he favorited me cause I am the most like him. He valued education and ambition and I think he felt my sister failed him being sick along with my brother. He acted as a father and I have good memories of him but he wasn’t exactly a emotional or loving person to my mom or at times me. But I guess I got the little he had in him. Now I’m starting to wonder if he was a sociopath or fuck a damn monster. After my brother who would be said sisters full brother died in what we thought was a regular car accident I found out it wasn’t. He was on pills and had an addiction and was telling people  this shit will kill me. And from the police report witnesses state he just veered into a pole never hit anyone or anything. Just went into a tree. My fathers first two children ended up like they did and then there is is me. Without my mom would I have been something different? While I pulled myself out of the hole I thought I was in, I haven’t done well in dating or making friends in my new city. before my parents illnesses I was good at it. I’m afraid I’m doing ok with all these losses because I am like him. Through my job I’m booking sessions with a therapist but im still scared to pick up the phone when my sister calls I know I sound really selfish ",Delayandrelay.txt

Today is my final day of school for this semester.  I have one more �exam� to go. It's in Advanced Comp.  We get to write persuasive essays.  I'm really good at those, so I'm not really worried.  I had my Art of Interviewing test today, and I'm worried about the matching section of the test.  I got a bit confused on it.  It was easy stuff, but my little brain just couldn't seem to process it. I wrote another long entry a week or so ago, but I lost it too.  In it, I ranted about a �friend� of mine. I don't like her, but she thinks we're really close.  She uses me and expects me to do things for her.  She presumes that I can just do whatever she wants for some reason that it unbeknownst to me.  I'm just sick of doing things with her and for her.  I want to tell her to just go away, but she probably wouldn't listen.  I made it perfectly clear that being touched pisses me off, and what does she do?  She touches me.  I just want to, at the very least, slap her.  I don't get why she has to touch me.  What on earth does she gain by touching me?  Maybe she's just forgetful, but why does she forget that, but she doesn't forget that I can type really fast? It's supposed to be stormy today, which I hate.  As I have stated many times before, I don't like stormy weather.  Hell, I'm afraid of stormy weather.  I like to be in my house where I feel more safe. I really don't feel safe at A&M since it seems to be a target for severe weather. I need to waste another twenty minutes before I leave to go to my final exam. I guess I can just keep typing, can't I? I mean, I have several weeks worth of crap that I can talk about.  Actually, I don't really have that much to say. I've worked on family history stuff, which is pretty neat.  I know that that's dorky to say, but it is nice to know where my family comes from.  I had a friend once who said that only Americans seem to care about their heritage, but I don't think that that's true.  If other cultures didn't care about their heritage, then they wouldn't keep information about it.  It would just be dust in the wind. I've replaced my Hayden Christensen obsession with an obsession on Eric Balfour.  He's Brian on Conviction and played Gabe on Six Feet Under, as well as Jesse (Xander's friend in the first episode) on Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  (He was also in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.)  I've gotten his band's CD (Fredalba's Uptown Music for Downtown Kids).  I've also bought a movie he was in (Lie with Me).  Both are pretty good.  The movie definitely isn't for younger audiences. I no longer have Gulshan as my therapist. I wasn't going to have her anymore because I have Medicare. I was going to leave her yesterday. I'm just sick of her. I tried to leave once before and she asked for a second chance. I gave her a second chance, and yesterday, she said that that never happened. Why would I lie about that? She asked for another chance yesterday before she realized that the Medicare would keep her from being my therapist anyway. I now have an LCSW for a therapist. That should be interesting. I should probably go. I hope that I actually get this entry to show up. ",Janet_e_2_a_1_us.txt

Tonight they both came at me and yelled about how I wasn't going to amount to anything and that I pretty much am ruining their current lives. They threw so much at me that it broke me and I broke down in the bathroom. My only remedy for all this pain is my girlfriend. She's there for me no matter what and understands what I go through. Recently I've been slipping a little in my grades (All B's and C's) and my parents have a very strict rule that if I don't keep good grades I'll have to leave my girlfriend. My problem is that if I leave her I'll have nothing to help me get through hard times. I'm only living for her and I'll have no point to be around otherwise. Sorry for venting but I've been wanting to post here for months but never felt as if my problems have been worth it. ",Captainschneids.txt

0,"Is it okay to be tired of pretending everything is okay to spark optimism? So I have alot going on in my life -- too much for me to want to spend five hours writing about it for this post. What's bothering me is that lately, things have been weighing down HARD. My patience is paper thin from years of abuse and I feel like in these last few months, I'm receding into myself because I don't have patience for even reasonable flaws in other people. I'm tired of being stepped on and dealing with the hand I've been dealt in life (I am CLAWING my way out of poverty ALONE, caused by a narcissistic parent kicking me out and attempting to kill me at 17 -- just made 21). I finally told my boyfriend today, not mincing any words, that I'm so fucking tired of being optimistic. That I'm tired of pretending anything is going to be fine because alot of the times I feel like it won't. ""Faking it till you make it"" has worked for me in the past, definitely, but being optimistic to KEEP myself from being depressing/depressed is not fucking working for me. It's idiotic. It's not that I think things are 100% pointless -- I'm working on a set of skills right now to get myself out of my minimum wage job to get a much better one. &amp;nbsp; But I'm just exhausted from trying to not worry other people and not expressing how fucking done I am with everything. Is this normal? Is this healthy? Like I said, not giving up. I'm working forward. I just feel like the fake optimism is an extra step and a formality at this point and honestly complaining today made me feel better, not going to lie, as I do my best to not do that because I feel like I'm ""pushing myself on others"" (my situation is so bleak that people almost never know what to say in response anyway because there is nothing close to an immediate solution). But I feel angry and spiteful that people who have been given everything or that can recieve assistance from family telling me how I have to ""perk up"" because It's ""what they do when things are hard"" when their ""hard"" is ""I stayed up all the time in college to study and it's hard"" vs ""I stay up all the time to study my new skillset AND risk my life every day on a chinese scooter that gives out at times to do deliveries in all of the elements to make a wage that isn't even livable, having one or more panic attacks a day because of dangerous drivers"". &amp;nbsp; I also feel bad because my SO is always trying to be an optimist. He's somehow perfected this even being depressed himself. Sometimes that bleeds through but he's usually hyper optimistic and it's exhausting. We've gotten in arguments in the past when he was less acquainted with my depression because if I wasn't immediately cheered up by him making jokes while I'm crying to make me laugh (let me work through my emotions, damn... It works sometimes but not ALL the time, seriously), he'd get insulted and take it personally that a single joke was not enough to change my outlook on life and fix all my issues. I feel kind of like I got a little snippy with him when I complained earlier and kept cutting him off and telling him how hopeless I felt and telling him, emotionlessly, ""I just don't care to be optimistic. I don't give a fuck. What's that going to do? I'm already tired, it's just going to make me more tired"" because I had a feeling that that was where he was going to go with it. I feel bad because he's just trying to help. But I am so fucking tired. So tired. I have a hard time doing anything if I don't think it has a point (Even if I hate a job, I'm still getting paid, and there is therefore a point to it) and I just didn't see  the point of doing all this. I think I do to make him happy and worry less about me. But I'm so upset that I don't have the capacity right now to do more things to emotionally keep him comfortable. That's stupid. I feel bad, but that's stupid. ",CaliBounded.txt

My mother is the oldest daugther and my aunt (her sister, and Bobby's mother) is the youngest, with an age gap of 15 years old and even though they weren't really close (my mom moved to another province when she turned 18 and didn't came back to where we live now until she was 43, 2 years after my birth), we used to see each other at least 2 times in a week. I'm an only child while he is the youngest of 2 sons and since he's only 3 years older than me, my mom and my aunt thought it'd be nice to make us spend time together. We got close, really close and were like inseparable. But when he turned 12 or 13, he did stop talking to me, all of sudden. He doesn't say hi to me when he and his family visit us. Hell, he doesn't even look at me when I open the door. A year ago, during New Year's Eve, we were sitting in front of each other during dinner and I was staring at him because he looks really good now that he lost the acne. He noticed what I was doing so I moved my gaze to one of my cousin's baby and when I looked back at him, he avoided my gaze. I told my friends about him and they say that he must be embarrassed about something but I dunno about what or why since he never did something weird or bad to me. All of my other relatives told me he would start talking to me again when he got older and mature. But oh surprise: he is now 20 and at college, and he still doesn't talk to me and avoid my gaze.

Two of the girls tagged/mentioned the others in the group in something on FB - places to go for drinks. Both times I was not mentioned, despite saying that I'd like to go. So, am I being paranoid? Or do I have a right to be upset? Rationally, I shouldn't be. We don't know each other that well, so they can't hate me yet. But I don't know.

I have a family history of bipolar depression but I am not sure if this is a disease that is genetic to such an extent. Does it skip generations?

0,"Yep - I know this all too well. And it is a sad state of affairs. But you are aware of it. Best you know what is going on than be surprised. SN, I hear what you are saying about not being able to weather another strike against your stability now. And I hope you do not have to go. I will pray with you that you are spared from the cuts this time, but while you are praying and hoping, consider the issue of your personal power. If you are feeling shaky in other areas of life, I doubt that you feel that you have any. I have been in that situation over many things. Remember the difference between what you DO have control over and what you do NOT have control over: you can control the way you approach this job, your punctuality, your diligence, your politeness to other workers; you CANNOT control the decisions made on the top and how they will affect your status. I have been reading a book called ""Corporate Confidential"" by Cynthia Shapiro. She was an HR manager for her whole life and spills the beans on how companies decide who will stay and who will go. It was an eye-opener for me. Perhaps it can help you at this juncture. In your own prayers, remember to ask God not just for the optimal decision to be made on your behalf, but for the power to see where you do and do not have control and for help taking charge of the areas that you actually can control. When you are in a phase of instability, it seems that more and more garbage gets thrown your way. But a turning point comes when the indignation of being tossed on everyone else's sea propels you into action. That turning point came for me about 9 years ago when a really awful roommate had to be ejected. I felt a power I had never felt before - the ability to take charge of my own life, not waiting for someone else's decision to tell me whether I was going to be OK or not.

I set off late on Saturday with my pick-up truck and a U-Haul trailer full of all my stuff and made it to Arizona (2415 miles) in 3 days. The truck then promptly broke down 70 miles away from my cousin’s house! What are the chances of driving that far and then it packing up on her doorstep?   After 2 weeks the mechanics at the garage managed to figure out the computer had gone on the truck and that is why it had stopped which would have been great if it had not been the air sensor that was the problem. Although I did get to do some of the best mountain biking of my life in a place call Sedona, AZ so who cares?!   With the truck still out of action, I was forced to ride to California on my Triumph 955i motorcycle, through some of the best desert roads on the planet - life is hard sometimes! When I got to California, Scott a friend of mine put me up in his house in Orange County, which was very cool of him as I stayed there for 3 weeks and he never once complained about the smell. I had a copious amount of job interviews during this time and was offered a number of them, but in the end I have gone back to working for Rentokil-Initial for the third time!   Therefore, with a few weeks to kill before I was due to start working again, I went off for a ride on the Triumph up through the mountains of California to Lake Tahoe. Tahoe is one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen and well worth a visit if you are ever out this way. I then rode back down through the deserts of Nevada past Area 51 and Death Valley to Las Vegas and back to my cousin’s house in Arizona. It was good to relax, do some camping, laugh and point at fat Americans and take some time out.    So I am now back to working in the Tropical Plants Division, selling plant services (selling flowers in San Francisco may sound a little gay to you and to be far it is!!).

HOPE.  so if you got it, send it my way. are you a christian man or woman who has found a great sexual and life partner despite not ""appearing"" to be the christian norm? i often consider giving in to a casual encounter, but i honestly don't think i could physically go through with it...and i'd certainly beat myself up afterward. not out of guilt, necessarily, but just cuz i know that's not what makes me happy.  life is good in so many ways, and hopefully through more of the posts i can open up more of who I am to myself (and to anyone who cares to read them). i am a very odd combination. and i like it :) but i think most people find me very confusing (probably think i'm a prude)...and they like it from about 10 feet away. goodnight moon.

But if you have it all you want everything and need nothing. we inven tmore and more things to make life simple, but in turn it just makes everything more difficult. you have money therefore you dont know what its like to be without or if you dont have any money you dont know what its like to have. everyone is unique, we have our own thoughts, thats what makes us who we are. We all like And dislike different things. we all believe in different things, and everyone says they like it that way but as soon as they find out someone is different from them they want to sprint in opposite directions of eachother or they wnat to make eachother like themselves. Everyones perfect. you all say were not because everyone makes mistakes, and thats what makes us perfect. Our differences and mistakes. NoOne is perfect to us because we base our lives on imperfection, therefore noone knows what perfection is. In order to find out who you are you have to experience as much as you possibly can or else your not giving yourself a chance to be happy. thank you for reading this even though i know its really scattered and probably makes no sense to you. i apologize.

0,"Just some curious questions here. I am recently undergoing lots of stress in my life. My work is failing and I am struggling keeping up. I recently have a new born in the family as well and extra workload at home too. I noticed these few symptoms:1) Often worrying, going in a loop worrying even about small things 2) Very easily agitated, get angry very easy 3) Weird sleeping pattern, can't sleep at night and sleep 10-12 hours straight during the day 4) Hard to concentrate at anything serious, easily distracted 5) Have up and down moments, sometimes it feels as though nothing has happened, sometimes it hits hard and I could waste one whole day just sitting at home being totally non productive. 6) Easily give up at everything I do, everything seems to be hopeless at times. I am putting off going to the doctors for a long time now. I previously been to the doctors and was given 2 different kind of antidepressants and I really felt awful taking them and stopped. I am reluctant going back because of the same reason. Is this a serious matter that warrants me to see the doctor again? Just hate the feeling but I noticed the ""downs"" have been coming on more and more lately due to more stress load. Please advice, and if possible give some advice concerning the medication I am most likely to be given if I go to the doctors as well...thank you. ",lostandconfused_e_2_b_1_uk.txt

0,"I'm trying to go back to school after dropping out of college many years back, and I've got this real supportive boyfriend who wants to help me. Problem is, he's got this need for me to go out there and change the world. He keeps saying I need to be better than everyone in my class, and that I need to be hyper - prepared before I even start class. I don't mind boning up on the class material beforehand, but he wants to help me come up with theses and bring those to my undergrad profs for help, and he wants me to read a whole bunch of texts from my chosen field before the semester starts. He also wants me to study anatomy because, as he says ""anatomy doesn't really change"", so I can be the ""go to"" person with whom all my classmates will want to study. I'm really bright and would like to make something out of myself, but he's got such high hopes and he wants me to do way too much way too soon. I don't even know for certain what I want to be at this point - getting back into the liberal arts program just seems like a good start towards deciding and acting. All this pressure from him is making it hard for me to even take the baby steps I need to take to make anything at all happen. When I try to tell him it's too much pressure, we wind up in a shouting argument (actually, I wind up doing most of the shouting - he just has this way of pressing my buttons.) I've spent my whole life as an inactive perfectionist, and all this from him just makes it hard to break free from that. Meanwhile, he's afraid that I'm going to spend my life playing video games (a reasonable fear at the moment.) He keeps saying lately that I need to move out of childhood, but he wants to parent me. rrbleh.. is there some way to just move around him without having all these arguments, and without letting him pressure me?

0,"this is my first post , so bare with me. I have been married a year and just found out some interesting news about my husband. He told me that the man he calls dad is not really his father. He told me that his mother never told him until he was 13 years old, and had to go to court to change his name. I always wondered why, he and his father never got along. His mother won't tell him who his real father is. I feel I need to help him find him, so he can close the door, and get answers to all his questions. My husband does not like to talk about feelings, he was raised in a family where no one talked about feelings and if you had a problem you  kept it to yourself. I was raised totally opposite. In ways this has left him hurt and confused. He feels like he doesn't belong sometimes. He told me sometimes he would like to know who his dad is and other times he could care less. But, it seems like it is always on his mind, when family issues come about. The man that raised him, is an issue all to his own, he is very abusive, physically, and mentally. He is always telling my husband, he is wrong and will never be able to be successful. He has heard that all his life, but he has never believed it - he is strong and has a good heart - It just hurts me when I see him lash out. He takes all his problems out on me, I now understand why. I have not told him, but I found out who his father is. All I have is a name. I want to tell him but don't know if I should. I don't want his mother not to talk to him if he knows - I'm very confused - I'm right in the middle and don't want anyone to get hurt. Looking for advice - or someone that can relate to this.

0,"Beautifully Broken I’ve spent most of my life afraid to be my true self because I believed that if I didn’t live up to the standards and norms that I grew up with, I wouldn’t be accepted. I was told since a young age how I should act, talk, and dress. I was told that money was important and that attending societal events and bullshit balls was your key to social success. And those things, trying to “feel” important, had meant everything to me. But then life screws you over and suddenly your perspective on everything changes. I learned that I no longer wanted to be the person that everyone said I had to be and things that had once seemed important became trivial. I realized that I didn’t give a fuck if I had Tory Burch shoes or a Chanel bag. No amount of money could ever bring me happiness, which was clearly evident in the money that was spent on “I’m sorry” shopping trips and my therapist. Things started falling apart at home when I was 15 years old. So my remedy to broken family was to drink until I couldn’t feel. But despite my new fond love of alcohol and its pain killing effects, I kept my life together. I worked hard in school, I stayed active in my community, and I made sure people thought I was keeping it together. I couldn’t let everyone know that I was a fucking mess. But in this process, I slowly lost myself and started living two different lives. When the curtains were wide open, people saw a girl that was very studious, had many accomplishment’s, and always had a smile on her face. But as soon as the curtains closed and I was alone, my demons came out. And the more I hid, the more I lost myself. At one point, the alcohol wasn’t enough. Things had only gotten worse at home and I needed a new escape. The first time I did it, it was a pair of scissors. It was small, barely noticeable. I had sworn after the first time that I would never hurt myself again. But eventually I did, and when I left for college it had only gotten worse. By my second year of college, I had reached my lowest point. I was in a toxic, emotionally abusive, relationship. I had a broken relationship with my parents, who spent most of their time stuck in a cycle of fighting, not speaking, and then pretending that they were okay. I hadn’t spoken to my older brother, a struggling addict at the time, in almost a year. I no longer knew who I was. So one night I went out and bought a bottle of wine with my fake ID and went back to my apartment and chugged the entire thing. I sat on my bathroom floor crying, staring at the knife in my hand. And in the back of my mind I thought about the gun that was a few feet away from me hidden in a book that my dad had given me for protection. For the first time in my life, I had looked at mortality straight in the face. I had questioned it many times, but it was never like that night. Eventually the crying stopped and the numbness came, a feeling I had become all too familiar with. Would I do it? Could I do it? Would anyone care? I was consumed with darkness, but there was a small flicker of light, of hope. I wanted to help people, I wanted to one day to change the world, or at the very least change one person’s life. I wasn’t ready to leave just yet, so I held on to the tiny amount of hope that was left in me. I called the cops and was admitted into a psychiatric center. I spent 48 hours in a white walled, emotionless, prison like place. And not once did someone ask me if I was okay. My parents came up to see me and had a difficult time accepting what had happened and I didn’t understand why. They knew I wanted help, they saw the scars on my arms, and they knew that I wasn’t okay. They blamed my relationship with my then boyfriend and told me to never speak of this to anyone. They didn’t want people to know I was “crazy”. Was I? During that time, I came to believe I was, but now I understand that I was just broken. It’s been over three years since that happened and although I still struggled with a lot after that, I’m now in a better place. The reason I am writing this is because I promised myself to one day help the 15-year-old me whose cries for help where tossed to the side, who was told she was over-dramatic and crazy, and who thought that cutting was the only way to cope. There was a reason I grew up surrounded by mental illness. I watched not only myself go through it, but I saw my brother, my parents, my friends, and so many people on the news struggling with their own demons. And this didn’t happen because life felt like fucking me over, it was just trying to show me what my reason for living is. I spent years ashamed of the person I was because I was scared to show people my true, raw, fucked up self. But isn’t that the problem? When it comes to having a mental illness, we believe the stigmas that come attached to it and we’re afraid to speak up and talk about it. And the people who are lucky enough to not experience it, don’t want to talk about it either. The only difference from how mental illness was treated a hundred years ago and now, is that we no longer hide and chain our family members in basements or attics, but the shame and embarrassment is still there. And I want to change that. I want to remove the stigmas and stereotypes attached to mental illness and get people talking. But change starts with me, and that means that I can’t be afraid to share my experiences. This is who I am and I wouldn’t change my life for anything in the world because now I truly understand what it’s like to live with a mental illness. I finally know what the difference between sympathy and empathy is, and that is one of the greatest gifts that could have come out from this. I will be exploring different topics on mental illness while trying to find ways to change the way people think and talk about it. I will not only be looking at the psychological background of mental illness, but the neurological background as well. More and more scientists are publishing articles on different alternative treatments that don’t involve medications. One of my favorite topics, which I will soon explore in more detail, is neuroplasticity, or the brains way of re-wiring itself to create new circuits, and essentially a new you. I’ve set a goal to one day create a facility for those who are afflicted with a mental illness. But instead of white walls, cold stares from employees, and isolation, they will be surrounded by beautiful colors, the outdoors, and people who actually care. Our current mental health system is completely and utterly fucked up. We can’t keep over-medicating people and throwing them out into the world with absolutely no regard for their actual well-being. If these “treatments” were actually working, we wouldn’t be seeing an alarmingly increasing rate of mental illness. It’s time to re-define mental illness and stick a middle finger up to all the people who tell you that you’re crazy or different. And maybe I am crazy, I’m sure as hell different, but that doesn’t make me any less of a person. I’m proud of who I have become and now I know what the purpose of my life is, and I’m not going to stop chasing it. -RBZ “Sometimes the most beautiful people are beautifully broken” -r.m. drake ",RZ-BeautifullyBroken.txt

0,"42 year old male newbie, just discovering that I suffer from depression. While there has been evidence all throughout my life, and while I have family members that have suffered from depression (grandmother committed suicide), I for some reason am just figuring out now that I suffer from the disease. My questions for those much more experienced and knowledgeable on the forum. 1. How would you go about your initial steps of diagnosis and treatment? I currently do not have med insurance, so cost is certainly an issue (we should have medical insurance in place in about a month, as part of my wife's new employer package). 2. I take a healthy dose of vitamins daily, including proteins such as L-Tyrosine, which helps me feel really good when I'm not under the effects of depression. Does anyone on the forum have experience with L-Tyrosine and its impact on their feelings of depression? I understand that the amino acids help with the production of dopamine and helps with brain function. Any comments? A little background: I am just coming off a very successful 4 year period where I started a complicated new business and got married again. However, during these last few months I have been unable to work at my previous pace, putting my business in real jeopardy. In fact, there are only a couple of days per week where I seem to be able to work, and typically only a few hours at a time during those days. When I do work I get exhausted quickly. Today, I had a major conference call that required some preparation. I was very up during the call, but then collapsed afterward in complete exhaustion. Seems to be the story for me recently, I can psych myself up for short bursts of performance, then I quickly decline again in an inability to concentrate on anything other than light web surfing. I continue to get up early and exercise daily. I live a healthy lifestyle, eat well, and walk 5+ miles every morning. I sleep regular hours, however, will sleep a few hours during the day during my 'down' days.  Looking back at my past, I am now clearly seeing times in my life where my performance level went down drastically, or where I had problems with relationships. At the time, I didn't realize anything was going on, or I simply didn't understand it. I can now go recall having real problems with my grades during my freshman year of high school. At the time, I recall saying to myself that I couldn't understand why I was performing so badly. It was as it something was holding me back and I could not overcome it. At the time, I just kept studying and working harder, but I was unsuccessful. Eventually, I got through it and my grades went back to normal. But all of these years I never really understood what happened in that freshman year, until now. In summary, there have been many other times in my life where things have fallen apart and I have not understood why. My past is littered by successful businesses that I have created and then have eventually failed, usually by my inability to maintain my performance level. There has obviously been a pattern that I do not yet understand, but at least now I am beginning to see why there was a downturn. Thankfully, I have now met the women of every man's dreams. While she knows I am depressed I have not yet let her know the depths of my despair or of my recent understanding of my past behavior. The good news here is that I have great family support, but I am wrestling with how much to tell my wife about what is going on inside my head. She gets stressed easily and will worry deeply about me. I'm not sure I want to lay that all out on her. Anyone else find themselves in this dilemma? Well, thank you for giving me the opportunity to share and to join this forum. ",rianji_e_1_b_1_xx.txt

1,"Need advice on a friendship! Need advice on a friendship!So I’ve written on here a few times about this crush I had on this straight guy I worked with at work for a little over 6 months or so. To summarize it, in those short months or so we became friends I guess u can say. We both are a year apart, he likes sports, music, and video games, etc. Anyways I developed a crush on him and I couldn’t handle the fact it would never happen, so I said to myself to try and make this friendship something memorable. We hung out 3 times outside of work, the third time was kind of quick but it was still outside of work and it happened last Friday, which I loved not only was I trying to catch up with him since we hadn’t hung out since December and it’s already March. So to put in perspective, I know it’s long but bear with me, it seems like our friendship is awkward at time, there’s long silences in between, don’t really have much to say. I mean for me it’s hard already hard enough for me to engage in a long convo, I’m sort of shy but I’m trying to break out of it, and don’t really have much to say, it sucks because I feel like I’m ruining a friendship that could be great. He kind of has the same personality when I’m with him. I don’t really have many friends well because they’ve all have been assholes to me, so I really don’t have many people to talk to when I want to. So what do u guys of my friendship with this guy? Is it me or do u think it’s complicacted? Just another one I don’t I ever receive text messages from him saying what’s up or checking up on me. Now take for granted he might have a lot of friends so idk. I’m usually the one who texts first ",Prince_1997.txt

1,"I dare you guys to figure this out. So I met rhis girl during fall semester for college. We found out that we went to the same school as each other, but she is a couple of years younger than me so we never really met before until summer. So we started hanging out after class, and a few times on the weekends. She has always had some what of a communication problem and depression problem. However before i knew that there was a tjme where i messaged her and she hadn't responded and a couple of weeks had gone by. I was thinking that I was annoying her. So i told her we shouldn't bftiends anymore. Later finding out that she had communication issues. She literally has like no friends at all which i genuinely believe. Eventually we see each other in public, afterwards i message her and apologize, and wanting to befriends again. She eventually accepts my apology and we're somewhat on good terms.  We eventaully hang out in person again and she is talking to me about how her boyfriend never talks to her and that her dad is being mean to her. So i give her the advice that idk her boyfriend but he could possibly be cheating on you if stops communicating as much woth you. But, again stressing idk know him so take what i said with a grain of salt. Weeks go by and she evetnually tells me that our friendshup isn't going to work out, and that nothing good has really came of it. And i should just stkp trying to be friends. This really hurt me i care about her a great deal. She then proceeds to unfriend me on facebook, and snapchat, and tells me to not contact her anymore. I need some helps guys, i feel like i should give het somr space and time to cool down and then i should message her apologizing for everything and that i want to be friends again.

I took the pictures tonight of the belt ceremony using my wife's Fuji S2. Sharp camera! Since I am an asst instructor I am now teting every month. I have my patterns down through Green belt, and plan on learning Blue and Purple patterns this week. :)  This weekend I did my first ""non-official"" videography event - a ""reception"" party for a couple that was married in Hawaii several months ago. Luckily it did not rain since it was an outside event. :) I took about 2 hours of film. I would think that a wedding would have actually been easier since there are actual ""events"" that you have to capture. This was basically just a party and therefore I became more the voyeur than the observer like normal weddings in that I had to walk around taping interesting converstaions. Luckily the bride & groom both have very outgoing personalities as do most of their close friends. My wife was the photographer (http://oneclickawayphoto.com) so in some cases I followed her around. But as the night wore on and the drinks became more potent I was able to pull out some interesting stories from some of the key attendees. Though I was really wanting Grandma to participate but she did not like the idea of being taped.

Ive been in a dark place for a long time but im the kind of person who channels this into humor so not even my family could tell. I just turned 20 yesterday and ive been depressed for about 2 years now. I havent opened up to anyone about it because i keep brushing it aside thinking it would pass but it just keeps getting worse. Today i realized something that made me genuinely cry, i seriously didnt remember the last time i was myself. I used to be super carefree and relaxed, i was full of energy and would answer any call to chill in seconds. I just asked my close friend when was the last time he remembers the real me and he said it was the beginning of college and im currently finishing my second year. Its been getting progressively worse in the last 6 months with a serious drop in my appetite.  I also started feeling anxiety for the first time in my life and suicidal thoughts are uncommon Ive lost about 10 pounds in 2 months because of this. My grades also took a hard hit, going from a 3.0 gpa every semester to a 1.7. I just had a talk with my mom and she told me that im being ungrateful and that i need to get my shit together (ironic considering she suffered depression for years until i pushed her to divorce my father).  Im not blaming her at all for my situation because she was raised by two hardasses so i understand why its hard for her to understand why a teen would be depressed.

Luckily, the paramedics came in time and he was able to survive through surgery. He's on medication now and all of his tests have come through positive, but he is still overweight. He's 61 and I realize he's not getting any younger. My mother and I have been trying to get him to eat healthier and stop drinking so much, he drinks chardonnay every night and a lot of it a week. EVERY time we bring it up, he immediately diverts the topic to something else, and blames us for being negative and to be more ""positive"". He says he works too much and that we are just ganging up on him. Psychologically I believe he's just so stubborn that he won't ever admit to actually being unhealthy and doing something about it. He's tried to workout but he never makes much progress. I want my dad to live for as long as possible, but he's just so incredibly stubborn and toxic about it that eventually i'm afraid he's not going to last much longer, we are both incredibly frustrated.

1,"My Father and Step-Mother sound like they will be getting a divorce. I have three half siblings whom I'm relatively close to, two of them are teenagers and still under their parents' care. Anyways long story short it's my father's consumption of alcohol that's causing the damage. He does well for awhile then doesn't and it's been going on like this for years. Unfortunately my father and I aren't that close. It almost feels like we're walking acquaintances inside the same home when we have dinner together as a family. He seems distant to everyone in our family as well, it can be hard for him to open up. I think my father is really depressed, but he refuses to see a therapist or anything like that.  He may be going through some sort of (late) midlife crises right now. He still works his job and apparently brings home enough money to support his family. My step-mother took me aside and looked worried about her situation. She expressed that she may need to get legal help, and is concerned about protecting her children. At this point, I'm going to try and open up to my Dad and just point blank ask him what's going on with his life? He's about to lose his wife of 25+ years and hit a hard rock bottom. I hate to see him do this as he's been a pretty good Dad overall, and always provided for his family... at least keeping our heads above water financially.

My husband doesn't understand what the effect of him not spending that time with me and us has had on me. Just like tonight instead of asking me and the boys to run to town with him, his friend went.

0,"I don't think who try to kill themselves actually want to die From my experience and one of a close friend who almost died in a car accident, I think people don't really want to die. We just want the pain to go away. All the shit we take  and all the heavy baggage we have to carry, just makes us tired and lose hope When we ponder on death, we see an easy way out, so as to get rid of the unbearable agony we suffer. Moreover, I watched a video of suicide survivors. About those 7% who survived suicide, claimed that in their final moments, when they were throwing themselves from a high place, they said they'd regret everything and wanted to live. Now imagine all those who died and regretted in the last moments. Personally, I've been close to do it, but my online friends gave me so much support and so much love that I noticed that it's not worth it. I still have things I want to do. Sure getting out of bed is still a huge task. Today it took me 2 hours just to do it, but I did it. I'm not sure if I should have posted this in suicide or here as it has to do with both.

This is also much more of an issue in colder areas or for those who cover up from the sun often. The best way to get vitamin D is through certain food combinations and routines in sitting in delicate morning sunlight and in most cases, taking a supplement is necessary to keep this vitamin flowing in your body. Vitamin D is best absorbed with calcium, so if you’re taking a supplement, finding foods, or sitting in the sun consider to add the calcium as well. You will find that your mood will be better or more stable with vitamin D consumption.

I just find it weird really that there have been ""so many"" of them...mustn't complain though if they're interested in buying the place.

1,"Losing my brother My brother died suddenly Friday night. He was 38. He was pretty much estranged from most of the family, spent some years making bad decisions and doing drugs and it caught up to him. He was trying to straighten out his life and cut out drugs and negative friends, from what I’d heard. He was in the ICU recently with heart failure and pneumonia. We talked while he was in the hospital, a lot of apologies and crying and encouragement, just a brother and sister having a conversation. The next day his blood pressure was supposedly good enough for him to be released. 10 days later, he was gone. My family members are taking it in their own ways. We all had unresolved things, a relationship we were hoping to rekindle, a bond I wanted to forge again with my big brother. He was my best friend and hero growing up. My biggest challenge as an adult. I feel so much regret and heartache over this, I can’t even begin to explain. He didn’t have an easy life. We lost a lot, he went through a lot, some of it was because of his choices, I really feel he was trying to make it right but it was just too late. We lost our grandpa and dad in the last 2 years, now my brother who was the first born grandson. I don’t think I’ll ever get over this. ",mj6578.txt

1,"My friends fall out with the rest of the group as we don’t agree with them on genders. I’m just going to get straight to the point, I have these two friends ( I’ll call them Ava and Chloe) who fall out with me and the rest of my friends as they believe there’s more that two genders and the rest of us don’t believe that (I’m not saying they can’t believe that but I’m just saying the way that they act when we say we don’t is bad). They usually talk to us the day after and act like nothing happened, but it bothers me. So here’s a summary of what happens. Someone brings up the topic of genders, and then will say how they think there’s two, then either Ava or chole will get mad and will storm of or start shouting at us. Ava once called my boyfriend a “close minded cunt” simply because he said he didn’t agree with her. If they believe that there’s more than two genders, I am totally ok with that, it’s just that they try and make the rest of us believe it too and then put the blame onto us and it’s starting to bug me. So if anyone knows what I can do about this, I’d be really glad if you could help me out. Thank you for reading :) ",heyder225.txt

We started dating and it turned out we and tons of similar interests and very similar morals. A few days after we started dating she told me that she was going to australia to study abroad for 10 months, weeks later she told me she was afraid to lose me I told her we would worry about it when the time comes. Since then we have had some really great times doing things we both love together. Yesterday we finally had the discussion of what was going to happen when she left. In my mind I was hopeful that we could maintain this relationship despite the obvious obstacles. I told her I cared about her more than anyone I have ever dated and said that I wish we had a chance together. She told me she doesn't believe in long distance relationships, this kind of broke my heart but at the same time I knew it was the logical choice in this situation. She told me that she did not want to cut me out of her life and that she wanted to stay in contact with me. She also said that if it was meant to be that it will happen for us. My family has been very hesitant about our relationship because they worry about me spiraling downward when she leaves. I am a little worried about myself as well, today I cried on the way to school and during my break between classes. She leaves in 6 days and she still wants to see me as much as possible before she leaves. I am so afraid to lose her and scared of how I will feel when she is gone. Please help.

Started out with celexa after I had my last baby, went through some ppd and haven't been the same since. I was on celexa for 14 months then stopped for 7 months, then went back on it and totally had a bad reaction. Then came zoloft, that lasted about 3 months sent me in to some sort of mania, then there was wellbutrin, wanted to drive off the road in to the lake on that, then came effexor which I thought worked but apparently I also was going through rapid cycling, I kind of liked that. I spent 3 months on that and about a month on the wellbutrin. Then came paxil cr, was on that for 6 months but I just cant get past these mood swings and outbursts. So now I have been on Lexapro for almost 3 months, today the doctor decided to increase me to 20 mg and add lamictal for my mood swings. I am a little nervous about starting this new one. This rash I hear about sounds scary. I also take 1 mg of klonopin as needed(everyday) I just wonder if I will ever feel the same again, but then it has been so long that I don't know if I would even know what that feels like.

With all of the tragedy going on in our gulf coast as well as the war, I feel I have no right to be unhappy but I am 24 / 7. I am 37 years old and have made a complete mess of my life.  My parents were raised in Europe and came to the states in their 20's.  I have a younger brother who also has depression but it differs from my own.  When I look back at my childhood all I feel is pain and neglect and I can't recall any happy memories.  I don't believe that I was ever physically abused however, I do think that I was ignored and emotionally neglected. Perhaps that is why I manage to make a mess of my life every time things seem to be going well.  I'm married and have a 4 year old son.  From all outward appearances, my life comes across as perfect (although we all know there is no such thing). I have been seeing psychiatrists and therapists since I was 17 and have tried to commit suicide on four separate occasions.  My mother suffers from depression and her mother did as well.

1,"Leapfrogger/Friend Stealer/Friend Poacher etc. Just for some context in my form group (like a morning register class or a house class as some call it) I sat at a table with people I didn't really talk to, but since I couldn't change seats I decided to make some friends with people at the table. In grade/year 8 or 9 I met two guys who are now great friends of mine, one I talk to more than the other since he stayed at home instead of at school due to health issues. Fast forward a few months and you have the situation above. So I started talking about a common interest with this guy we shall name Manny, now Manny and I only talked in form, and after I would go back to my main social circle with my best mate. After a while (about grade 9-10 maybe) I decided Manny should go and chat with me and my best mate's social circle for once, so introduced them both to each other, and they got on well. Now between year 10-11 I definitely noticed that Manny started taking more of my best mates interest, which makes sense and happens often so I didn't think of it. It only caught my attention when my best mate stopped inviting me to events such as hangouts at the park and going on cinema trips with my other friend who stays at home. Instead he would invite Manny and Manny would invite him and some of my other friends to many events like the cinema and sleepovers and whatnot. Over time I would be completely excluded from my friends activities and everytime invited them to do something, they would say ""im not sure if i can go"" only for me to find out they went with Manny somewhere. Sure we are all still friends but I feel like i'm being slowly excluded. Is this just me? What do you all think? ",GoneInTheWind20-02.txt

0,"'I promised I'd post regarding what I perceived to be a meltdown. As previously posted, I told all y'all that I'd been taking Neurontin. Since it wasn't prescribed for seizures but for sleep, insurance would no longer cover it because they said it didn't fit into the category of antidepressants or psychotropics, and so on and so forth. All red tape. So, the Neurontin was stopped, through no fault of my own. Well, this disturbed my therapist. So, after almost 6 weeks off of the Neurontin, during which each week I seemed to be going more off the deep end. Meaning, I couldn't sleep, eat, had the shakes, horrific mood swings, unable to think positive about myself, and piggyback panic attacks and I subsequently was going off on some crying gig, etc. So, on the 22nd when I saw my doctor she said with everything I was describing, that indeed I was having withdrawals. Like Duh, I already knew that. It seems the combination of the meds I was on was balancing me out and the mere change in the medicine did in fact change the way the other meds worked, or didn't work. Since I'm so hypersensitive to just about every medication, (it took forever to find the right medications and dosages to keep me on the straight and narrow) the doctor said she'd like for me to go back to the psychiatrist that originally prescribed the medications and see if they'd try another antidepressant. Another one? That didn't set well with me and I guess I was at the end of my rope. I broke down and ended up staying at the doctor's office for almost two hours while they had to give me a pill to calm me down. I felt so vulnerable and of course in my state of mind I perceived this as another crisis. I also felt extremely 'stupid' for breaking down that way. That is why I said I had a ""meltdown."" There wasn't much I could physically do on Thursday, but, I knew I had to come back to earth. After calming down, thanks to their ""cocktail pill"", which I didn't ask its name. I agreed to see the psychiatrist. What choice did I have. I think the crying episode happened because I remembered all the bad events that happened while they were trying to find the right meds that would balance me out. It's scary. Of course while I was at the doctor's, I kept asking stupid questions like, ""why do I have to be on anything?"" Is that denial or what? So, to cut this short. I'll be going to the psychiatrist as soon as they can fit me in. But I need some help. I'm asking any of my friends here to give me any input you want. I've been doing pretty good the last couple of days doing the cognitive thinking and just staying busy. It's the down time that's unsettling. And obviously, if you see the time this is being posted, you know I'm not sleeping much. I am thinking positive. My doctor called me Friday to check on me. That was surprising. A doctor really calling back. So, seeing how she's my 'new' doctor, maybe we'll be compatible after all. Thanks for taking the time to read this and for anything you'd like to add to help.

I tried to save our plans, but she seemed disinterested. I was so distraught and caught up in sadness and self-hatred that I, wanting to distance myself from the situation, not just leaving it alone, told her I wanted to break up with her out of sheer emotional irrationality. It turns out I was sadder without her, and she reached out to me to talk soon later. We got back together, and she said she was okay. The way she described the whole situation let me know she understood my plight completely, but I ruined her that day and she's been off ever since. She painted her nails black, screamed at her parents, texted all her friends to tell them how much of a terrible person I was, wrote ""Anon is a piece of shit cunt"" in her bathroom mirror in sharpie, and cried all day from the story she told. I've fallen into a depression of guilt to a magnitude that I haven't experienced since I was a self-loathing near-friendless 7th grader with pent up emotions drowning it all out with video games while tanking his grades, watching the few distant friends get reward after reward, trophy after trophy. I feel like I'm a piece of shit that doesn't deserve to breathe the air on this earth, and I don't know what to do. My parents are very unsympathetic and judgmental and my brother is borderline abusive. My girlfriend is the only one left who understands me. At this point, it's just me who has the problem, as she's gotten over the whole debacle, or so she says. Her mom even said ""ehh, you two were just stressed out teenagers"", but I'm still not convinced. I feel like there's something deeply wrong with me. Is there any advice or words of wisdom that I need to hear? I want to get back to normal. I don't know how I'll deal with feeling completely alone again and losing the people close to me emotionally.

1,"Living in California I discovered a wonderful sport - Rugby. I know, I know what you must be thinking. Extreme pain. Trust me, the way girls play, it's not painful. It's like tackle football with the guys back in the South. If you don't want to land on the ground, just find somebody and land on them.  I can run pretty fast, so I'm a center (in a full squad of Rugby I play outside Center). Summer 7's (that's 7 minute halves, with 7 players on a full field) is geared for the backs and I absolutely love it! It's the closest I'll come to playing contact football, without the protection (mouth guard is it baby).  I play with some of the girls on the San Jose State team. They are a bit whacked (yes, Virg, I'm talking about you, and you Kelly). Last year on Thursday nights we'd practice on the beach then head over to the Beach Boardwalk and ride the roller coaster (and while most people hung on to the safety bar, Virg hung onto her breast, to each their own, I guess, Virg you little freak).   So far, on our first tourney we won all three games. I was unable to play because I popped a blood vessel in my eye.  I know what you are thinking - Ew.   Trust me, I ran for my phone so fast to call my eye doctor, Holy Toledo. I wasn't in pain, just had this HUGE bubble of blood in my eyeball, well, that's gone but there is a sea of blood around my eye now.  Of course I now go around freakin' everyone out. My rugger mates told me to come up with a creative story, that taking my contact out wasn't good enough... so here goes:  Two guys, one small room, very little time...

0,"This morning M finally confessed and now I know the truth: This IS summer here. I realize I spend a lot of time talking about food, the weather and nudity on this blog, but these seem to be re-occurring themes of my new life and, really -- what's more important than having nice food while naked in excellent weather? Not much, I say. So, despite the long arduous months of patiently awaiting the promised beauty of a Dutch summer, what I'm really getting is this: Virtually constant canopy of gray/black clouds? Check! Scarves and light jackets lest the freezing summer temperatures turn your nipples to stone? Check! Got your umbrella for sudden downpours that may or may not contain hail? Check Check! Surly attitude because you can't wear your pretty sandals (unless you like blue toes) and your boyfriend's been lying to you for months about the upcoming lekker warm weather? Check and check and check! Try to ignore that previous blog entry within which I detailed all the nice things about Holland at this time of year and the fact that the weather was oven-hot.

1,"The city I work in, which feels and seems much more like a town, has a courthouse square downtown.  There is a big courthouse surrounded by a fair bit of grassy area with lots of trees, a beautiful little spot really.  It really adds to the whole town feeling.  All sorts of things happen in the town square: art festivals, performing art festivals, food & drink tasting, local merchant festival, and many more.    Well, one thing I've noticed since I started working downtown is that people (men mainly) like to take a mid-day nap in this courthouse square.  I lived outside of new Orleans before I moved here, so at first I thought these nappers were homeless people, untill I paid a little more attention to them.  The majority of these napping people are wearing clean, well kept clothes, and are clean-shaven.  In other words, they are just people who live/work around downtown who like a little afternoon nap.  They pick a tree, lay down, and just doze off for a little while.  I find that kind of interesting. ",3819977.200407140.female.23.txt
1,"Is it me? Hello. This is my first time posting here. So the other day one of my friends texted me, saying I think she's dumb and that she demands respect (this is a month after I just hung out with her; everything seemed fine). She then accused me of insulting her and the school she goes to. I insisted that she took what I said out of context (for example she said I think her major is easy. I never said this, I said it wasn't math focused. Plus she herself said she is having an easy time). She constantly asks me if I think she is intelligent and I always tell her she's smart in her own way like everyone is. Anyway, I said sorry and have a good holiday but she didn't reciprocate and just told me to watch what I say and not to tell anyone she said this. This isn't the first time this kind of thing happened. One person I know just hates me (quote:""*** hates you and everything about you. He just does."") and I have no idea why. Sometimes he's cool, other times he ignores me (he has pointed out that I'm light skinned black and he's dark so apparently I'm treated better; eveb if that's true I am not responsible for that). Another person hated me for reasons unbeknownst to me (excluded me from group chats and gatherings, made this known to others) and now I'm told they love me (largely made up with this person but I never knew why they hated me to begin with). I'm extremely confused by all of this. Now I'm a guy who was known as the smart, quiet kid in school with a lot of knowledge. Occasionally I'll let people know my opinions and they'll get a kick out of it. However, I really made it a point to be polite to people even when I disagreed with them or didn't like them. Most people I know say I'm genuinely kind or polite even to the point of being boring.I go out of my way to refrain from cracking mean jokes or speaking bluntly because I know it'll offend people. I try to balance the thoughts in my head and the words I speak (isn't this normal?). Most people at my current school say I'm very nice and friendly. Am I doing something wrong or are people just being bad/weird to me? TL;DR: I tend to get people who hate me and I don't know why; most people say I'm a kind and logical person. ",andyforever7.txt

I'm in my first relationship ever. It took us a long time to get together. Now instead of being happy I feel... numb? Or scared. I'm fucking afraid to ruin everything. I'm constantly overthinking things, doubting my feelings, thinking my bf is better off without me. I'm just so confused. Where are all my happy thoughts? The main problem is that some people out there tell me that my feelings aren't enough to be in a relationship with him. Sounds more like we're best friends. I don't feel any spark/butterflies, I don't get nervous around him. I like him very very much, can't imagine being without him. It just feels familiar to be with him. I dreamt of having sex with him... I'm normally a very distant, shy person due to the way i was brought up so hugs and all that stuff are things I'm not used to. I've even wondered if I'm asexual.

Lately I feel as though I've been more crazy than usual. I can't stand human contact, not just from my wife, but from anyone, a handshake, a hug, anything. I just tense up and can't breathe. What the **** is wrong with me? Yet I lay in bed wanting her to hold me, but when she does, I can't breath, it has nothing to do with how she is cuddling up against me, it's just how I start to feel.

1,"Friend is badgering me to give them stuff, and frankly it's making me feel less inclined to reciprocate. So. I'm going to use fake names for these people instead of referring to them as mere pronouns. Me = The CrazyCOKids Orlando = The guy who is badgering me because, well, Orlando *is* the name of a character in Redwall who is a badger. Grath = Second person Fallow = Someone else, mutual friend of all of ours. So. Grath and I decide to do something together just the two of us. However, Orlando is a bit... *jealous*. Like, all the time someone else I'll refer to as Fallow wants to do something with me or Grath. Orlando seems to have this... massive victim complex. This isn't entirely unjustified mind you^ , but the problem is, he tends to extend this to friends. If say, Grath or Fallow decide to do something together, Orlando assumes he is being excluded on purpose and maliciously. See, we basically want to be friends with each other, rather than being ""by association"". (ever hang out with a group of people, yet you realise the only reason you know some of them is because another person brings 'em along? yeah.) We basically don't wanna just be ""Orlando's friend"" or ""Grath's buddy"", or ""Crazy's friend"" to each other. So we're intentionally doing some things with each other. Orlando, however, wants to be included in *everything*, and thinks that if people are doing something without him, he's being excluded intentionally and maliciously. So at first we didn't mention what we were doing, because Orlando would come in private and ask ""You going to do me next?"" or start going all ""Oh nobody ever thinks to include me I'm always the one left out"" or starts trying to guilt-trip us. But then, well, that obviously made him think that we were hiding stuff from him. Whenever we went to him first (and boy do we ever) he doesn't complain, and frankly it seems like we really shouldn't have to run everything through him because we're not in grade school still and you know, oftentimes if we *do* run it past him and ask if he would like to get involved he complains that he feels like 'the third wheel' or 'like we're just including him to be nice'. :/ Then he decides to start harassing us asking if we'll include him in things, essentially demanding we do things to him to make it up, then doing things like ""I just want to be included so then I can at least enjoy this thing"". So he guilt-trips us with how bad his (admittedly shitty) homelife is to try and get us to do things one-on-one with him or give him gifts. Enough is enough. Simply put we wanna put our feet down - again. Except! I know what'll happen. Orlando will take it as an act of aggression and with malicious intent. Grath will start complaining at Orlando for (admittedly) being immature about the whole thing. He'll start acting like we're ganging up on him, even though we're trying to tell him that when he asks for stuff in private the way he is, that we're only doing it just to shut him up. i've tried telling him to try organising things himself for a change so he's not always going ""Hey! Wait for me!"" but he doesn't seem to get it. ",CrazyCoKids.txt

We met in our mid and early 20s (im being 5 years younger). We met on a the job years ago. Well five months ago when she was stressing about her day... Listen bitch our manager gave us more rules.... Time froze like huh? :/😨 Also I'm 30 shes 35. I let it slide since I thought maybe that was a mistake. Maybe she was so stressed out? Well it didn't end and got worse... Everyday she leave me text messages, and recordings updating me of her life and each sentence I was called a bitch. Listen BITCH.... Yeeees BITCH..... Then this BITCH at work....,but you get me BITCH.... I told myself, BITCH you need to hit the gym ( Yes at times she called herself a bitch which is fine.) Lucky for men they'll never get called bitch by her. I made excuses for her saying maybe it's a temp phase. 3 months in I told her I don't like being a bitch every sentence positive or not. She said this how her and her family always talked. I thought I known you for 7 years...never heard of this. Then she continued to talk and yup calling me a bitch. I continued telling her to stop at times. Other times I just tried to ignore. One month ago she texted me that shes working with a nurse who is a woman who has a grill in her mouth. And how cool she thought that was. And how she hopes to become a nurse someday with a grill. I had to catch myself....to me grills look ugly on men and worse on women😝. I faked it like....yea...um cool... :/ Well a 5 days ago I got fed up. I told her 6 days ago calling me a BITCH 50 or so times a day must stop! We never had a argument...maybe a few disagreements.  She went off and was pissed I didn't want to be called bitch for fun. I told her I'm not a dog in heat! I told her my name and that I'm  a girl or woman hell even calling me a female is nicer. She said shes not about that girl power or that feminism crap! FYI...shes actually into feminism and don't know it. I would love to be a house wife,take my voting rights away and I love dresses. Shes willing to support a 3rd world man soon,talk about how if she gets a great degree she can support her man lol. I felt myself at the time great sadness here she was going off at me for not wanting to be called a bitch. She then says her family call each other bitches alllll the time. After she went off....she went back to talking about how she wants to go to school. I never felt so degraded and disrespected.  I decided this friendship ends. I'm very nice, and consider how others feel....she basically treated me like a door mat. Next day I texted her I'm not a dog. Not into being called a bitch daily and I no longer can do this. After I texted that I blocked her number asap. It's crazy about 3 or 4 months ago. She was mad that when she called a coworker a bitch instead of saying girl or other friendly terms...she caught that coworker talking about her warning others to stay clear of her because she will call you a bitch. She called me about it all mad. I told her I actually understand that girl....she completely ignored my remark. I plan on changing my number soon...maybe. But I do feel better that I don't have to hear that hood talk anymore. I was her only friend. Hopefully she can make new friends who don't mind being called that daily.

He was dating b and I's friend (named 'e') for a long period, and tldr, he was extremely abusive and raped her multiple times during their relationship. B was friends with E. Recently, B decided to begin dating S (after lying about meeting him repeatedly over a couple days period). I cut off the friendship but she kept trying to speak to me as I didn;t think she got my point of not wanting to be her friend but I think I've made it more clear in recent messages. It turns out B may have lied about a lot of things (to the point of manipulating me about my trauma, telling me certain people said things about me and didn't like me. she says they definitely said it but the people say otherwise so I don't know who to believe. she has extreme 'stories' that i don't know if are true anymore either). B thinks that me cutting off the friendship is to an extent not fair as it's not my business to make her choose between her now boyfriend and me. I disagree - she is dating our friend's rapist (well not her friend anymore) and I find it disgusting and I can't be friends with her due to this. Mostly, I am paranoid that I am.. well.. wrong. Overreacting, as it's not 100% to do with me - I was friends with him during him and E's relationship but not after I knew of the way he treated her.

But now... I just want to be a sloth. I want to sit on the couch and watch TV all day. All motivation I had prior to last week has just gone. I’ve never had anyone this close to me die.

NO NO.. karen is a bad influence..heh.. i saved her from buying a cutie shoe from charles and keith.. i guess karen and i gonna be soul mates for a long time.. i lost my best friend and her best friend is at australia. so we can take care of each other untill clara returns.. and i got to return her to clara... actually i am glad that i lost pris at this time, she is seeing someone she likes, whom i disapproved as 'he' is not a christian, and i tink that they will not be happy together.. pris is always haunted by the bag idea that she shouldnt be going out with non christian... at least she has someone to hang on to if she is really depressed... and she has that group of girls to cheer her up... i feel that maby pris thinks that i am very shallow to give up our friendship.. but i have went alot to make a decision like this... i came a conclusion that i went through all her unhappy moments with her, and she shared her weekend with another group of people... many of her words sided them.. i decided.. that this friendship had to go... hiya... i hope i can get over this fast... ok.. better not talk too much about unhappy stuff.. its friday!... better finish up with my work so i can meet my darling tonight!!!

I'm tired of school, I'm tired of feeling inadequate compared to my friends who are moving on to bigger and better things, I'm tired of feeling like a disappointment to my family, and I'm tired of the shitty life I feel like I have. Yet the thing I'm most tired of is being unable to find any consistent motivation in my life, never truly feeling motivated to do or finish anything, just letting any and everything just pass me by. It makes me hate myself even more thinking about all the things I could do if I could just find some motivation or will to be better. ",ImSoTiredOfEverythin.txt

0,"What a great topic!! The news always makes me cry - and I end up turning it off shortly after I start watching it - why do I punish myself? My parents know that I have learned to not watch the news because of the negative effect it has on me, so if something really important is going on, they let me know. My Aunt suffers from chronic depression and delusion, and I've had numerous conversations with her on how to handle the depression because she's tried so many different things, even going to Mexico to see a Shaman. Her top 3 suggestions (and I really go by them as much as I possibly can) are: 1) Get proper sleep - this is probably the most paramount point; 2) get proper nutrition; and 3) don't watch the news. The one thing that I absolutely cannot tolerate is sad news about animals - that really sends me. When I'm flipping thru channels and happen upon Animal Planet and the Animal Police are busting people because of their cruelty - I have to turn it immediately. I think I'm delusional too in that I choose not to watch the news, animal stories, anything really unpleasant - I guess I try to live in my little world without negativity or sadness. I know that it isn't very mature or adult, but this is my coping mechanism. I do find that when I hear or see anything sad or awful that my negativity really gets into gear, and then I'm completely negative for awhile. Driving is also incredibly difficult because I commute into Washington D.C. from the suburbs and traffic is awful. I become so negative about the other drivers around me that I end up hating myself over my thoughts about them! They, of course, drive too slow and are idiots. I need to find a job close to home! I too have sometimes felt that the human race needs to think about not populating the world anymore. I wouldn't want to raise a small child in this environment any more! I'm glad my son is in college and he's the only one that I could have. But then again, I can't wait until my sister or brother has kids so that I can be with them and spoil them rotten. Crazy isn't it? I have taken others suggestions in this thread and have tried to make myself think positively the last 2 days. It's difficult but possible! I notice that my mood has brightened somewhat too. Thanks to you all for this thread, as I think it really can help! ",LAS_e_2_c_1_us.txt

1,"What's wrong with this friendship? I need some thoughts on this situation. Three friends of 20 years decide a month a head of time to go to a Gatsby Party for New Years Eve. All of them are single. Well, at least one of them is somewhat single. The less-single one is Charlotte. Charlotte has a new beau, who she has been seeing on the low for about two months. Melanie and Jenny can see that Charlotte is smitten. Ok, no big deal. All is good. ""Do you, girlfriend! Just don't lose yourself"". (Names have been changed) So everyone is planning for the NYE party. Melanie and Jenny have their outfits ready to go. The dress that Charlotte ordered is not going to be in on time for the party, so the back-up plan is to go the mall and find a new dress. Melanie goes with her, and Charlotte, reluctantly buys the best dress she can find, but it is not nearly as fabulous as the first dress she ordered online - which, again, won't arrive on time. The ladies planned to all go to Melanie's house early on the day of NYE to slowly get ready, play some good music, eat pizza and have a few drinks before they summon the Uber to take them to the party. The night before, however, the party's promoters announce on facebook that the venue has changed to another location. A little aggravating, but not a big deal. They decide they're not gonna let that mess up their NYE and want to have fun anyway. Anyhow, on Jan 31, at 5pm-ish, Charlotte sends a group text to the other ladies: Hey ladies, i know you'll probably hate me for this, but I'm not gonna go. I wasn't feeling it since they announced the change of venue and now James asked me to go to Vegas. So I rather do that. I apologize for the late notice"". Needless to say, the other women were very upset. Any thoughts? Should the other ladies accept that? ",mjber.txt

Right now she is almost done with college but I still have to take some courses so we don't see each other that often. That's why she told me two weeks ago we should meet up. I told her to pick out the day which suit her best. She said Monday and I agreed. Turns out my mum needed money so I have almost nothing on me and because of that I told her I could hang out but couldn't go to the restaurant she said we should try. She replied that she ""couldn't make it tomorrow"" (today) and I thought wth?! you said Monday? It was you the one who said Monday not me... Anyway she said let's meet up on Wednesday and I said ok but tbh I don't feel like going out whatsoever. She was sorry because, and I quote, ""I thought we were going to meet today"" and I'm like dafuq. She, all of a sudden, forgot about it?! Does it make any sense?

1,"26 thinking of moving family upset Okay so this past 5 months have been overwhelming. I’ve had a lot of major things happen. I got married in October and over the past year I’ve been connecting with my father and half brothers (who I just consider brotthers) and that whole side off the family. My dads never been apart of my life. I saw him probably about 4 times out of my 26 years on earth. The last time until this past week I saw my dad was when I was 10 so 16 years ago. That was also the last time I ever flew on a plane. I decided to fly down about two weeks ago for a week and I had such a good time connecting with my brothers and my oldest brothers wife and my nephew and grandparents and everyone! I loved the idea of everyone together closely and always at each others houses and I got along so well with my brothers and it was really nice. My brother and sister in law decide to that they’re going to move back to Florida where my dad and dads family is and they all really want me to move there. They love the idea of us getting close as a family and setting traditions and spending holidays together. Honestly I love that idea. My problem is my mother raised me, she’s always been there for me. She has nobody other than me. She doesn’t even have a car I drive her places. My grandmother who is also soo important to me she’s my second mother she’s been in a nursing home for 10 years and she’s confused a lot but still not that confused. The thought of leaving them makes me want to cry and I feel like I couldn’t. My mom would feel so betrayed and angry at me. She’s already feeling a little hurt because I’m getting closer with my dad that family. Which is wrong but she has a lot of issues of her own. The thought of leaving my grandma I could never. :( I just don’t know what to do. I’ve never left NY my husband also has his father here and his father would hate me if I brought “his son” away. My husband acts like he dose not care but ofcose he must. I just don’t know what to do I feel so stuck like if I even considered moving I’d feel so selfish and horrible. I couldn’t leave my mom and I feel like she wouldn’t come with me she’d be so angry that I was “choosing my father who did nothing for me and his family who ignored me” over staying near her. Idk this is probably all too soon also but I just want to form good relationships with my brothers and nephew and soon to be niece. And my dad. I don’t want my life to pass away and miss it all. Ever since I came back from visiting them for a week my mom has been giving me such a guilt trip about spending my money to go visit them or how she feels used and it’s crazy to me. Idk what to do But this is for sure a rant. Thanks for listening forever did. ",MonicaAshley845.txt
1,"Telling my bestfriend she's long winded without hurting her feelings? My bestfriends and I have been bestfriends for about 2 1/2 years. We met in our college choir and are still in college, just for context. When were at school we basically hang out every night and I love her but when she gets started its like she doesn't know when to stop. I've had to resort to redirecting my attention when she's been going on too long. She tells me the same, or similar stories a lot and has to give me all types of insignificant details that prolong her talking. Even when I bring to her attention she mentioned something before it usually never stops her from telling me again. It does get kinda awkward when I have to ignore her but it hasn't stopped her from rambling.

He was like a wild thing this morning, playing and running around this morning. The ride in the car was great! We were stuck trying to find a place to get across to the vet's office through all the traffic, and he just watched all the cars and trucks go by. He really loves to watch the cars and truck moving.  Then we got there, and I had to take him over to the side to go potty before we went into the office. He was a total spaz there! I could hardly contain him and in fact, he got loose of his collar and scared a poor little shih-tzu. They called someone from the back to come get him once I put the collar back on and I appologized to the little dog that was just shaking.  Anyway, he goes under the knife between 11 and 2 today, and I can call to check on him later. Then tomorrow he gets a bath before his daddy goes to pick him up. He'll be like a whole new dog!

0,"Hi everyone, I am new to this site and my name is Elie. I am a 38-year-old married mother of three girls and one angel baby boy who was born still 10/30/2003. My children's ages are 18 years old, 15 years old then it would have been Conner Charles. When we lost Conner due to an underlying infection and when I had the amniocentesis the infection got to Conner and he died a month later. That was very devastating to us but I have had a lot of support with an infant grief group in our area. After we lost Conner three months later we got pregnant with Charlene and she is so beautiful. Anyway things were going good (oh I forgot to mention the fact I remarried my ex husband. We were divorced for 14 years and we got back together). One day when the baby was 11 months old my husband accidentally spilled hot coffee onto Charlene's leg and she had a blanket sleeper on so she wasn't that bad. It was bad enough but because of the way the burn looked (due to the absorption of the stupid hot coffee) the doctor had her removed from our care until they could further decide if the baby was abused. I was dumbfounded; I have known this doctor for 17 hears with my girls Marissa and Jessica, so how dare he. I was so upset, but we have a DSS worker in our lives because of my middle daughter who has mental retardation, she is in a residential home because of her behaviors which in a way was excellent for us. Our worker seen and knew Charlene before the foster care and then when she finally saw her at foster care she did everything in her power to get the baby back and we did six days later. We are constantly in and out of court now because of this and then my husband was feeding the baby oatmeal and I was warning him to be careful she flails her arms, well she flailed and knocked the spoon out of his hand and the clump of oatmeal landed on her face ... we cleaned her up not noting anything bad as she didn't cry or nothing she wanted to eat. She ended up with a blister on her cheek in the spot that the oatmeal touched. We almost lost Charlene again. I went into DSS and said my husband was no longer going to be in charge of the baby and they felt better and I also said he wants parenting classes and they liked that idea. But this is my problem, how do I get passed this. I have a counselor already but you can never have too much support so I came to this web site. I can't even make love with my husband anymore. I resent him for putting me through this when I have been the most careful mother around. We also live with his mother because financially things are tight and right now its better we do because DSS notes it is a very supportive environment and I have a lot of help which I do but I can't leave otherwise I will have DSS up my back quite often. My husband feels that sex is the cure all to depression, he keeps hounding me and hounding me and I just don't want sex. When we first got back together this second time around things were awesome and we had so much fun but then we lost Conner, then had Charlene and then these burns and losing her and going to court. I have no say whatsoever even in my own room which depresses me but soon I will try and figure out how to get out of this. All I know is my husband better respect my wishes, I just can't make love at the moment. The last time was four weeks ago.

1,"In an awkward situation with my best friend. She wants me to tell how I feel towards her - how should I? I’ve been friends with her for 3 years. She’s a lovely person and I really like her, but there were some occasions where I felt weird around her. She apparently sensed it and recently asked me what’s wrong between us, telling I should tell her if there’s something. Some of the things I’m thinking of telling her are: - she often kind of invites herself when she learns I hang out with my friends and invites other people (that I don’t know well) as well without asking me when I organise something (picnic, trip etc.) - she’s a nice person and means well, but she sometimes says things that hurt my feelings. For example, she said she couldn’t wait to move into a new flat with her bf or how he’s like in bed when I was having a difficult time after a breakup, and she often assumes I’m broke and I feel sort of belittled. - she tells my rather personal stuff to her other friends, like gossip I could list several things, but I’m not sure if I should be upfront, as she has social anxieties and I don’t want her to feel bad or scared in social situations. Or are there nicer ways to put them? Also, I should probably mention that I have a small circle of friends, and she’s basically been my only friend that I get to see regularly, I’ve been really good friends with a girl (B) that I met partly through her for the past few months.

I just kind of threw away all the good prospects in my life over the course of a week and have been feeling like a piece of crap. Probably not news to anyone here, that's how it usually goes. But tonight I feel okay. I recently decided just to drop everything and run away (not the first time I've done it, I've gotten good at it actually) and have been just sitting while I wait for finances to become ready. This is a record low point in my life, but tonight I changed how I feel about it by just getting some chores done, getting drunk, and treating myself the way I wish other people would treat me. I'm talking booze and watching horrible telivision from the 80's And it dawns on me that I'll get another chance. I may have fucked things up this time but I've bounced back from fuckups before by just acting natural so I'm probably going to do so again. There will be more chances to treat people the way I want to be treated no matter what age I get to. I don't need someone to be nice to me, all I have ever needed in life is just to be nice to other people. It's a silly sentiment but it's all I got right now, I hope it reaches someone else who can benefit from hearing it. If you pray, pray for me in the next three months because it's  all I got.

0,"What's wrong with me? I just want to know what's really wrong with me, should I get help or something...I often think about myself like I'm a negative person. Some people describe me as cold as I don't really have any genuine reactions to anything just pure neutrality some even say I lack empathy. I keep most of my feeling and thought for myself and the only thing that's wierdly funny to me is dark humor and misfortune of others. My attitude on the outside, most of the times, is ""I don't care"", but when I'm alone, then shit goes down, anxiety, depression, dark thoughts you name it. I can go days without seeing anyone or speaking to anyone when I'm in this pit of my own making. But then again, I still have this slight need to socialise after some time. The thing is, some time ago, one of my closest friends asked me, what made me happy, when was the last time I was truly happy? And what worried me, I couldn't think of anything, still after thinking for like an half our, there was nothing. Don't get me wrong, I still laugh and sometimes even smile, but for me positive and happy people seem fake. Anyone in a similar situation? Some advice would be appreciated. ",Drunk_Nut.txt

1,"I have a close friend who is problematic, but not towards me A couple of years ago, I had a falling out with one of my friends and during this time, I fell back on this girl in my class, who I will call Blue. We got close in only a few months, and eventually, this will be the only time we will ever be in the same class. It was just the two of us. I'm in one of her classes now and my friends still associate me as her best or one of her closest friends. It's not a particularly good association (doesn't reflect on me though, just her). A lot of people don't like her, especially the people I'm friends with now. I haven't been around for a while (I moved down to Brighton for a bit of time) and I haven't seen her either, but I know that she doesn't have a lot of friends. I've been hearing stories and past anecdotes about her that really troubled me, so I'd like to have some advice. This one girl (who would never lie about something like this because she's so sweet, probably still hasn't gone through puberty) said that Blue once pit her up against the teachers and made her cry because she was so stressed and she didn't understand the situation. Blue has a kind of controlling personality and will not be open-minded to other people's ideas and input. An idea of close friend of my close friend, Yellow, was swept by as Blue simply dismissed it, and just wrote what she wanted to do in a group project. Yellow is also quiet, VERY passive and formerly a good friend of Blue and to some point, even I, so when I heard this happening to Yellow, I was really shocked that Blue could even do something like that. She will also guilt-trip you and self-deprecate herself. She will tell you that everyone hates her and that she's really bad at a subject she does really well in. It's annoying, and sometimes I even hear it, but to others she does it in this really soft, guilt-tripping voice. It's a problem because often, she's the problem and then she guilt-trips to turn it to look like she's saying that the people calling her out are just trying to make her feel bad. But Blue has never done any of this to me. When I'm around her, we talk about our futures and Star Wars. She jokes and memes a lot, but because we're not as close anymore, they aren't as funny. I avoid confrontation too so I almost never rebutt her points. Recently, she apologized to me about how poor her behaviour was back then, but I didn't understand what she was talking about. Now, I get it. But her behaviour wasn't just 'back then' either, it was also just a couple (maybe about two) years ago. Maybe even now, but everyone has probably already distanced themselves from her. She also has this fake 'caring' voice that she uses around the people in her music group. She never uses this voice around me, but the music people all generally speak like that. The thing is, the 'caring' side to her is just like a mask, and the people who know her know that she's not usually like that. She has hurt their friends who don't deserve to be hurt, and for no apparent reason either. I know that most of my friends feel uncomfortable bringing her up around me because it'll be something negative (I've never heard anyone who really knows her say something positive about her), but because of that I've been sheltered to how she treats her classmates. Another girl (Red) once said that while she was consoling a friend who didn't like to be touched, Blue came in, wrapped her arms around the sobbing girl and 'glared' at Red like one of those mean girls. Never have I ever heard something so cliched and dramatised, but unfortunately, I could definitely picture it. When I'm around her, I definitely don't feel like her personality is weighing down on me, but I'm conscious of the connotations surrounding her. All the girls mentioned are also my friendly mutuals, so they don't associate me with her, as I'm generally polite, quiet and will crack a joke around them. I also know that Blue doesn't like people so when we were walking from our class, I'm worried that we'll bump into someone that doesn't like her or whom she doesn't like. So yes, I am very bothered about how people view her, mostly because there actually is something to dislike. What should I do? Slowly back out of this friendship? Should I slowly doorslam her until the end of the year when our class is over? Should I just continue being her friend despite her bad behaviours? Two things: the stories are most definitely true, and I don't want Blue to know that I know about her being a bad classmate. I overheard these stories from reliable people. Sorry for the long post. Please help. ",nightection.txt

0,"Hi, I have posted a few responses on the forum, but this will be my first thread. I guess I am wondering if I truly suffer from depression or another mental illness. I have not seen a psychologist or a therapist, but I have been reading your threads for the last few weeks. My heart goes out to you and I wish that I could lend more support than I can. I know that my situation is not nearly as dire as many of you, but I still ponder whether I have a iproblemi. For the last couple of years, I have experienced an increase in mood swings. I will be doing fine and then a ilight switchi goes off, and I get a bad case of the blues. These can last for a few of days. In my mind, I know that everything is actually okay, but I can't shake the idowni feeling. I also have frequent bouts of being istressed-outi. By this I mean that all of the tasks that I need to get done seem to be insurmountable and that there will never be enough time to get things done. I sometimes break down in tears during my more manic attacks of frustration and worry. Life seems to have become one long list of stuff to do. Even the fun stuff has become something to get done so that I can move on to the next day. As for itriggersi, as I have been reading about in your posts, I know that I have two major issues. I don't deal well with my emotions when my husband gets angry (not abusive, just normal iguy angryi) or I feel that I have somehow iscrewed-upi and let him down by not doing something right. I turn very inward and the ilight switchi goes off. My second issues deals with embarrassment. I do not take embarrassment well. My stress/anxiety over getting the housework done stems from my concern that people may come over and I will be embarrassed by the state of the house (in fact, the house is always neat and clean, if a bit disheveled by daily life). I often worry about whether I embarrassed myself during social outings or at parties with my friends. My husband reassures me, but that doesn't usually ease my worry. My ObGyn gave me Sarafem (Prozac 20mg) three weeks ago, and I seem to be operating on a more even keel these days. The lows aren't as low and I seem to be able to let more stuff just roll off my back. I am pleased with the results, and my husband has seen a real improvement, but I am still asking myself the basic question as to whether I am indeed ill. Please provide some feedback if you can, as this is the first time that I have tried to really tell folks about how I feel. ",rosie_e_2_b_1_xx.txt

1,"I guess I’m done with her? Or is there something wrong with my attitude? So, in the Literature class, we did a practice exam paper and we had a peer assessment. One of my friend had my paper and it turns out she graded mine the lowest in the class. The teacher was actually surprised on her harsh mark and said jokingly ‘Hey, he (me) did all right. Isn’t that too harsh?. Later I approached to her to ask what was it that she gave mine a low grade. Then, she rants out all the things I’ve done wrong, but she spoke so fast that I couldn’t quite catch all of them. And I became a bit angry at her attitude because 1. She spoke so fast (so I couldn’t quite catch 30% of her points) which is likely to be intentional so I’m startled before I can argue back. 2. Majority of her points were about that I lacked explicit points, but the teacher ticked all the points and said they were explicit enough? So, I said back to her ‘Hey but the teacher said the essay was all right’ She scoffs and says: ‘Yeah, write like that in the real exam and you will totally pass. Who are you kidding?’ Now I wouldn’t really complain if she actually gave me valid constructive criticism, but she spoke so fast (likely to be intentionally) and most of her points came from simply her not reading carefully enough.. BTW, she actually achieves better grades than I do and is clearly smarter than I am. Not trying to be boastful, but in this Literature class, I really think it’s safe to say that I get better grades than her most of the times. And, she’s not a teacher. What the hell does she know better than the teacher to say things like that, especially when she gets lower grades than I do most of the time??? Besides, she really always says rude things in front of someone’s faces (and many many times in front of my face).. and she’s sometimes in her own world and can get really arrogant and cynical.

0,"I just told all 100 students I teach I have depression in an email about finals week I'm an undergraduate TA at a university, in an interdisciplinary class about the brain. I absolutely love being a TA, but admittedly this quarter it has been a struggle mentally, I often feel anxious that I am doing a horrible job. I sent out this email to all 100 of my students about finals: Hi everyone, These next two weeks will be a really, really tough time for all of you. I know how incredibly hard you all have worked this quarter, and how hard you will push yourselves during this final stretch, but there are 2 other things I want you to know: 1) I, the other TAs, and our professor will not be disappointed if you do not perform as well you want, so you shouldn't be either. Tests and grades are not always the best reflection of you as students/scientists, and they are most certainly are not a reflection of your worth as a person. All a test assesses is how much content you remember and how well you can take a test at a certain time on a certain day. It is simply one data point, and as you should all know by now, 1 data point is not representative of the population. For many of you, you have other finals/presentations/responsibilities going on, and it'll be difficult to find time to study. For others, you may want so badly to study a lot, but can't because you are so stressed and anxious. I personally deal with anxiety and depression, and I know how utterly frustrating it is when your mind doesn't work as well as you want it to. 2) Take care of yourself. Eat good food, get some sleep, spend time with people you love. So, while you prepare for finals these next weeks, keep these two things in mind. You are all incredibly curious, kind, intelligent and important people. I brag all the time that I get to work with the most amazing group of students who bring unique and valuable contributions to this class everyday, and inspire me to be the best TA I can possibly be. Cheering you on!! ~austen1996 (I can't believe I just told all my students about my mental illness, but it honestly feels so liberating to do so.

Isn't it strange how when u have alot of friends to talk to you dont care about the people who mean most to you, but then when you lose all your friends you try and turn back to the ones who care about you even though you ignored them and treated them like jerks. Isn't it strange that the things you seem to hate most in life are the things that will help your life, like doing math homework, or getting grounded for failing a science test that u didnt study for to begin with. Isn't it strange how sometimes your worst enemie becomes your best friend, and your best friends sometimes become your enemies. Isn't it strange how when someones so happy with the thing they have you start to get jealous insted of being happy for them, then start to want something just because someone else has it. Isn't this just all so strange? ",4089416.200407310.female.14.txt
1,"My husband is not my best friend. Friends jealous of friends. My husband isn’t my best friend and that’s ok. In fact, it’s more than ok. Yes, he is my friend but our connection is deeper than that. We are building our lives as one. Sharing our day to day, filling them with constant support and security. I love my husband deeply but we are also different people. He plays video games and I do arts and crafts. He watches war movies and I go to brunch. I value my friendships &amp; consider them a priority in a different light than the priority my spousal relationship takes. Because of our many differences, I take and make the time to build on my friendships. If their partners are their best friends, I am truly so happy for them. What a beautiful thing to find. However, I tend to notice that those are the friends that often get jealous of my other friendships or the plans I make with others. I hope that I make it clear how much they mean to me because that is all I can do. I don’t have a live-in best friend. I don’t spend all of my hours or all of my days with my partner. I have different people in my life for different reasons. I love them all. I think my biggest insecurity/worry is that feeling that I’m sometimes expected to put my life, needs or other friendships on hold while those with “partner bffs” hang out with their bffs. Not everyone can understand, so I have to teach myself to let go of the guilt. Truthfully though I just reaaaaallly wish my friends with bff partners could understand so they’d stop getting jealous. They want me to be and still call me their best friend but they already have one. We were “best friends” till they found their partners and I harbor zero resentment for that, all I want is happiness for all of us. Sure you can have more than one best friend, but I simply don’t take their priority anymore.  But so I have to move on, ya know? I keep in touch and try to maintain our friendship but when I get closer to a different friend it angers them in a way. If I make plans for a trip with a different friend I am ridden with guilt. Do I just tell myself to get over it? I’m doing my best? I know there’s nothing but love on my part. So it’s not truly my problem, right? (Easier said than done with that mindset though) TLDR: my friends boyfriends/fiancés are their best friends. They get jealous of me getting close with or making plans with other friends while theyhangs with their bff partners. Not my fault right? ",GrittyBraces.txt

0,"I'm a 23 yr old university student and I think I'm getting depressed again. One of the debates I'm having with myself is whether or not this is really depression. I was diagnosed with it about 2 years or so ago (although it wasn't my first bout of feeling low) and was put on a high dosage of medications (which I took). Things got better after a few months and so of course I stopped taking them cold turkey. Obviously not the best idea in the world, aside from this being one of the worst things to do because of the possibility of reoccurrence, my body went through heck and I had some pretty nasty side effects (even worse than when I was actually taking the meds). Fortunately, it didn't reoccur and I've been feeling fine until the past couple of months. I think I'm feeling the warning signs again: low energy, crying, circular thinking, apathy towards everything, skipping school, sleeping all day, anxiety ... I just feel like maybe this isn't really depression, maybe I'm just a person who doesn't handle stress well. Jeeze, when I read this it sounds so ridiculous. Part of me knows I'm being illogical but another part is just blaming me for being weak and not being able to just sit back and enjoy life. Why can't I just be happy? Why do I have to be so moody? Why am I so weak? It's stupid but I keep blaming myself. I don't think I'm bipolar since I've never experienced real highs but every couple of years or so my lows get really low. Last time was by far the worst and I wouldn't have been able to get through it without medications and I don't want it to get to that point again but ... I guess I still feel a lot of shame about it. It still feels like depression is being weak. I know, I know it's just like having diabetes and your body needs the chemicals to be normal but *sigh* I still blame myself. Last time I told my teachers and some friends and it's like they look at me as if I'm contagious or insane. I don't know if I can go through that again.

0,"I've already posted on this forum but  I never really introduced myself.  So here goes: My name is Amy, and I am 24 years old.  I have two beautiful daughters, ages 5 and 3.  I am also raising my little brother, who is 1.  I have suffered from anxiety attacks since I was 16 and became seriously depressed about 2 years ago.  I was hospitalized once ... when the doctor put me on Zoloft.  Since then I have tried Effexor XR and Klonopin (worked for 8 months) and am supposed to be trying Wellbutrin and Buspar now (scared to start them).  I self - harm when things get too hard for me, and have scars covering much of my left arm due to cutting.  I was recently dismissed from my therapy / psychiatrist due to missed appointments ... and I don't know if I am going to find another one yet.  I think about just letting go sometimes.  Nothing really helps anyways.  The one thing that depresses me the most is my fear of spending the rest of my life alone.  Men seem to think I am only good for one thing ... and I guess I agree.  I hate that I go from being okay ... sometimes for weeks at a time ... and then everything falls apart.  My family supports me ... sometimes.  At least, my mom lets me crash at her house when things are real bad.  My mom and my sister try to be there ... but they get tired of me.  I can't say I had a bad childhood ... I can't remember my childhood.  I went under hypnosis ... had a vision of my dad and became extremely afraid.  I never had a chance to go back and find out why.  Missed too many appointments.  My dad was accused of being abusive (to my mother) and having a violent temper ...  and of molesting my sister and I.  Don't remember.  My dad says my mom left us for two years when I was 2 or 3 years old and was always drunk.  Don't remember.  I spent much of my teen years drunk / high and being promiscuous ... let's just say even my mother knew I had a reputation.  Why?  Don't know.  I have never felt like I belonged ... and the past few years I have felt like I haven't really been living.  Disassociation, I suppose.  I am usually moody, never have any energy, and have started and quit school 3 times to date.  Never accomplished anything but getting my GED ... and the sad thing is ... I'm smart. I live day to day ... never knowing if it will be a good day or a bad day.  My daughter had missed a lot of school because I can't seem to get her there by 12 in the afternoon.  My mom says she will help ... but I know I am on my own.  Neither of my daughters' father's are any help.  My dad left my little brother with me in November, sends down some money every month... and hasn't seen him since.  Some days I feel like I am on top of things ... most days I feel like things are on top of me ... and smothering me.  I've started writing my daughters a letter letting them know everything I want them to know when they are older ... just in case I'm not around.  I can't say for sure this won't beat me one day, and I want to be prepared.  I love my kids ... but also believe with all my heart they would be better off without me.  Sure ... they love me and I'm their mommy ... but not all mommies are good mommies and not all mommies deserve to raise children.  Love isn't always enough ... because God (is he even real?) knows I would die / kill for my girls.  I know the answers to nothing and have so many questions.  This is my life ... Scared to be alone ... but I always am.  I read this somewhere and it sums up how I feel: I'm not hungry ... but I'm starving.  I'm not tired ... but I'm exhausted.  I'm not bleeding ... but I'm dying. So hi to everyone who is fighting the same fight ...  I just need to know that I am not alone. ",foreverbroken_e_2_a_c3i_us.txt

0,"I've realized that I made a big mistake by starting this blog. It serves no purpose to put feelings out for public view, so I've deleted the entries from the last six months. I was going to explain some things, but thought better of it. I think a small part of my old self has awakened again. I'm a bit ashamed of all the whining I've done here. I'm embarrassed that I've sought out people in my life for emotional support when I should have dealt with things privately, on my own. When I lost my mind to grief, I forgot everything that I knew. As the old adage goes: you come into this world alone, you live alone, you die alone. You solve your problems alone, needs to be added. The intense pain of grief can warp your mind, impair your judgment and make you do foolish things that you will later regret. I'm sorry if I've upset anyone, but my intention was simply an attempt at self-help, not to change the world. I was simply searching for a way to try to deal with and escape from this pain. I've always appreciated the supportive comments left by people and I thought I had expressed that before. I never thought anyone had an expectation that I would contact them or would even really want me to contact them. I am after all, a stranger to those who have read my words. I was getting to the point where I was starting to  consider emailing some of the people who have posted comments, just to thank them, but now I think that it's better that I don't.

0,"Hi everyone. I am a 26 yrold mom of three, 6 and under. My depression started as a teenager, but somehow back then I was able to ""talk myself out of it"" and perhaps had enough going on to keep me distracted. I got married right after high school, and nine months later, (overnight, really) became a mom. I never intended to be a mom at nineteen. I had dreamed of going to college, enjoying years of freedom with my husband, and then, carefully ""planning"" our first child. Well, seven years later, we've planned only one (our last), and strangely enough my only planned child was the hardest to recover from emotionally. After the birth of my first child I struggled with denial over all my crushed dreams, and fought back depression and suicide on a daily basis. I saw a psychiatrist who put me on various medicines over the next few months, to no significant improvement. When my daughter was three months old I was voluntarily committed to a behavioral health facility and stayed there four days. I came out fully charged, and within a matter of days, was right back where I started. So I started seeing a therapist who did me little good, and continued on the latest medicine combination I was prescribed. Shortly after my daughter turned one I finally gave up on the medicines and the therapy and pretended to be better, even though I wasn't, because of the sheer frustration that nothing was ""helping"" so I might as well just get on with life. I continued to battle depression and suicide on a daily basis, and also struggled with behavior that was contrary to what a good mother should be. My husband was military, and it is during times in his absence that I have become ""her"", my alter ego, someone who is intolerant, impatient, selfish, and ugly towards my kids. And blah, blah, blah. Do you guys get tired of telling your life story, because I do. I've lost count of how many times I've told it to various therapists in some vain attempt to help them understand me. So let me tell you where I am now. I am a person who is deeply confused. On the one hand I dearly love my kids, my husband, and I have the desire to live life and see my children grow and strengthen my relationship with them and my husband. On the other hand, I am sapped of every last ounce of purpose, life becomes extremely monotonous, and I strain to see the point of it all. Even now, as I write this, I am wondering, ""why am I wasting my time? These people will never know one tenth of a percent of what is going on inside me."" And that is how I've left every therapy session I've ever gone to, feeling like my time was utterly wasted and like I've made a chicken scratch in an issue solid as ice and twenty feet deep. I balance on a fragile thread of life and death and I'm scared that it is only a matter of time before something tips the balance just far enough that I finally do ""it"". My biggest fear is that by the time I find a way to heal myself, if I make it that far, my kids will have paid the ultimate price and be a product of confusion and sadness too. I am sick and tired of trying to feel human. In talking with others, I feel intangible, fake, this intellect in human form but incapable of human understanding. My emotions are real; love, hate, empathy, grief, anger, happiness, but I still do not feel ""real"". I feel like I am missing some vital component that ties it all together, and without it, I am nothing more than this body walking around, emulating those around me, operating on some kind of autopilot. It goes beyond frustration and confusion, and I feel this pent up rage building inside of me, and I want to scream at the top of my lungs until I turn blue, throw a chair through a window, send dishes crashing to the floor, something through which I can channel the anger and get it as far from me as possible. And then, sorrow. Black as an abyss, tormenting hopelessness, and it is then that I contemplate suicide. Fortunately (or not) I will then remember something, some reason for why I can't do it. The other day was my sisters birthday. I didn't want her to have to remember her birthday as the day her sister killed herself. Then I bawl, because there is no way out. I can't leave, and staying means continued torment for me and the people I love, and for some reason, love me. How long must I endure this cycle? Once again I am off medication. After the birth of my third child I went on the latest wonder drug, Lexapro, and after a year with no improvement I've abandoned that as well. I also made another mental health check in when the baby (now 1 1/2) was a few months old, for six days in duration, and once again came out feeling like a hundred bucks only to crash again. I've examined the perspective that, like the books title, ""Depression is a Choice"", and have even embraced the idea. I've also embraced the idea that it is certainly not a choice, and that medication is the solution, with equally unhelpful results. I grow weary of this fruitless search to ""fix myself"". For those of you who would suggest God, yes I am a believer. I turned to him three years ago, after years of Agnosticism, in utter desperation to fill in the ""missing link"". But for whatever reason, He still isn't enough. Which is the biggest blow of all, because I truly comprehend the sacrifice that was made in my behalf with the Atonement, and yet for some reason fail to utilize it. So here I am. One big mess. And I'm joining the group, lucky you! See you around ",pianofiend_e_2_b_1_us.txt

1,"Hi, I'm Tash and this is my random blog which I created for two reasons. One is because I was bored, two because I wanted a gmail account and three because I decided the world needed to hear the random Ponderings of a Nutcase. So thats me. The nutcase. I live in New Zealand in a house with a cat and a dog. And I like to be random. And my pet peeves are French keyboards, the sounds MSN makes and jingle singers. I mean who really puts on their CV, 'Ah yes, that's me. I sang in the Felix Catfood jingle.' ??? Also, I don't like Bush. At all. And I don't like Micheal Jackson because he has a dead nose and sings like a sick hippo. There are lots of things I do like though. I like melted mozerella, the number 666 - just a random thought but if there is an apocolypse, wouldn't it happen on 06/06/06? Just a random vibe - and I like redheads. I love shopping. Shoe shopping. But I hate French keyboards and porridge. I think that is enough randomness for now. More later. Tash P.S.

1,"So here I sit at work. Only three more hours left, I guess that's not so bad. It's over time so that makes it even better.    This online Blog idea was very clever. The user interface is very easy to use. I like it.    So when is it too soon to say I love you to someone? Or is there even a time limit on feelings and emotions. I don't think there is. I use to. I use to never believe in love at first sight. But just because you don't believe in something, doesn't mean it's not there. It's amazing how I use to think when someone would say, ""Oh you'll know when you've found the person you want to spend the rest of your life with."" I'd think to myself, how can that possibly be? How can you possibly know that just after meeting someone. Use to think it was all just movie talk, hollywood glamour to sell movies and merchandise. But I believe it now. I think deep down in my heart I had always wanted to believe it, but never wanted to get my hopes up for fear of being let down.    An Ex of mine use to get so aggrivated with me during our break up, cause he kept asking me if I see him in my future. I kept telling him I don't know. Because well, I don't. He kept asking if I had hopes for us to be together again, and I said, No. I don't have hopes for anything. Never have. It's better to have never hoped for anything, then to have been let down by those false hopes. But is it better to have loved and lost, then to have never loved? Going through the break up, I began thinking it's better to have never loved. But in recent events, I couldn't change my mind quick enough. I would rather have loved, and lost. The joy of being with that one person, and sharing moments and experiences that would never be the same, is priceless.    Well there is quite alot there to read. hehe I guess I should probably get some work done. ",3954575.200407170.female.23.txt
0,"I have had borderline personality disorder since I was a little kid. Although then the therapist said it was Bipolar Disorder and ADHD. Since then I have been on pretty much every medication you can imagine and even sent to a temporary mental hospital. It isn't until now that I self diagnosed myself with BPD. I don't even think my doctor really thinks I have that although considering all the research I have done I fit the description perfectly. Since the age of 13 I was being self destructive by slamming my head in the was during times of stress. The first time I starting cutting was when I was 21. This was after an ex boyfriend left me. We had only been dating for 3 months. Sad huh. This went on sporadically for about a year and a half (during that time I committed myself). Finally I started dating my next boyfriend. He told me if I didn't stop cutting he would leave me. I stopped. We dated 2 years and then broke up. I am now 27 and married to another man who is 12 years older than me. We have been married almost a year (together for 3.5 years) and about 3 months ago I started cutting again. This time it is 3 times worse and I can't seem to stop. I am covered in scars and I have even gone as far as cutting the inside of my wrist. I am currently on Wellbutrin which does seem to be working (I do have a lot of good days). Although since I started to become depressed again I have been having a hard time dealing with the fact that my husband has a son. It didn't bother me as much (just a little) before because I did my best to stay busy. Since I got married I lost all my friends and now spend every other weekend alone. Mostly in bed. I never had to play mom before so I never thought I would ever be in the position to, so I just stayed out of the way. Plus, his son doesn't like me being around. Which makes me feel worse. In my state of mind I can't deal with that. My alone time is when I cut the most. My husband and I are in therapy, my therapist wants us to work. I am not so sure I can stay with him. Although I am having a hard time leaving. I am just so tired of feeling so alone all the time and he is just not capable of being there for me. This puts extra stress on him and I don't want that. Plus, it is my fault I married him, I knew he had a kid. I guess I didn't know I would get bad again. Last week we talked about me leaving. He ran upstairs and cried (he said he will fight for me) I went straight for the exacto knife. I had suicide in mind although I see myself as a wimp in that area which makes me feel even worse about myself. I cut 5 times on the inside of my wrist but I guess not deep enough. He came down and found me. My antidepressants work almost 80% of the time but whenever I think of losing my husband I get sad and hopeless. Every time I think of staying with him and feeling the way I do all the time I get sad and hopeless. I feel cornered. Cutting make it all feel better, suicide sounds comforting. If anyone can relate or has any good advice I am welcome to it. ",ume143_e_2_b_c3c_xx.txt

1,"Best friend has a bf and is MIA I want to start a thread for people who have best friends/friends who have been MIA as a possible result from having a bf/gf. Please share your stories and give advice to those who post. So here’s my story: So my best friend of five years has had a boyfriend for over a year now. However, she’s recently been MIA. There has been times where I hadn’t seen her for two weeks or maybe a month, but this time it was a lot more. Despite living a few minutes away from me, I hadn’t seen her in 2 months!! Every time I asked her to hang out she would say that she was busy, but she wouldn’t suggest meeting another time. We barely texted around this time either, I was the one that mostly initiated the conversations. Although she was busy, she was able to meet up with her boyfriend plenty of times who happens to live an hour away from her. She would always post photos of them together in social media and I would honestly feel upset. Eventually, I asked her to hang out again and she said that she had plans to go to the movies that night with someone else(not her bf), but that I could join. So we went to the movies and she dropped me off to my house right after the movie because she had to wake up early the next day. So we didn’t really talk (since it’s the movies) and I couldn’t address how I felt about not seeing her since there was someone else there as well. Also, the only reason I saw her that one time is because I asked her to hang out. If I hadn’t texted her, then she wouldn’t have invited me and I wouldn’t have seen her. After that I didn’t see her for a while either and I wanted to meet with her in person so that I could speak to her. A couple weeks later we finally saw each other. The first thing I told her was how I felt upset because I felt like she wasn’t making much of an effort to even talk to me or see me. I told her that we should see each other more and she agreed. She then caught me off guard by stopping me and saying “I know what you’re going to say.” She claims that she knew and that she had been feeling guilty for the past months. She then said that those months were kind of hectic because her bf was going through something. But that’s it... she didn’t apologize and it just doesn’t sit right with me. All she said was how she felt guilty and then mentioned something about her boyfriend to justify her behavior for the past months. We hung out for a couple of hours, however her bf kept calling her and she’d answer his calls during this time. She’d recently gone on a short vacation and I didn’t know when she’d returned to town until I saw a photo on Instagram of her and her boyfriend together. I’m honestly very mad and I feel as though I can’t say anything because I had already mentioned it. What pisses me off more is when she had just gone on vacation for two days and posted a photo of her boyfriend on social media with the caption “It’s only been 2 days and I miss you sooo much!!” Like are you seriously kidding me, you hadn’t seen your friend in more than two months... I’m honestly so mad and I feel like I can’t tell her without her getting mad. She’ll probably get defensive since it involves her bf and since I mentioned it before. She’s honestly the only best friend I have and I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m starting to resent them and I don’t want to. Is there any advice that anyone can give me? ",Mari0798.txt

0,"In college (10 years ago) I was the victim of a gang rape. I've read up quite a bit and identified with all the stages and normal reactions... I went through the self blame, and guilt, and anger, and depression, and I came to realize it wasn't my fault. I never reported it and after a year I decided the best thing would be to forget about it. I pretended it didn't happen and went on with my life. I forced it out of my thoughts until it was no longer a struggle to do so. Eventually I almost did forget about it. I never thought about it and when the subject was referenced in other contexts I never even thought about my particular experience. It almost became some movie I saw, or some girl I knew about. I'm married now with a four year old child and I have a really great life. About six months ago I started having these rape fantasies. I've been too embarrassed to ask my husband to act them out, but he does oblige in rough sex, and I started asking for it more often. I've felt confused as to why I would want this with my husband (and it is always with him ... I don't desire this with anyone else) when I have this history. It started me thinking about them even again. Then I started having nightmares about three weeks ago. Horrible realistic dreams where I actually wake up and I'm still hallucinating that men are holding me down. Last night I punched my husband full in the chest because I thought he was attacking me when he was just trying to wake me from a nightmare. This along with the COMPLETE lack of sexual desire where before we had a very healthy sex life. I'm a big fan of the ""STOP THAT"" approach to self help, but I can't seem to stop this. I'm beginning to dwell on it now. Also I try not to ever deny husband and with the high job related stress he's having right now he's seeking sexual gratification every night. I'm beginning to dread bed time, and after he's asleep I'm up on the computer and drinking! ",dlc864_e_2_b_c1_xx.txt

0,I had skipped work today because this dream was too good to just let the alarm clock interrupt it. I've been able to hold onto my dreams a lot lately. Such as I can wake up and roll over and fall back asleep in the exact spot in the dream I left off.... Now the dream is I'm at some party. The room is very lavish looking. And everyone there I know. Feels like this party was somehow for me. Never has ever happened. Now the part that stands out is that I see my teacher who was my mentor she was everything to me. When I was in high school I not only had this HUGE crush on her but she was the kind of actor I had always wanted to be except I was willing to die for my art. Still am. She's sitting with her two kids. They're probably the most gorgeous kids I've ever seen and she hasn't changed. Her husband is in the distance somewhere. I never see him but I am aware of him. I thank her for all her time and effort she put into me and I ask her how it's going with her life and if she's still teaching. We talk about something else and the dream slowly fades away. Reality is I haven't heard from this teacher since I graduated. I heard she had a kid and she moved to vermont. I miss her terribly. Somehow this dream seems to have more than just one meaning. And since everyone else has dream threads I'm going for one too. ,livingeeyore_e_1_b_c1_us.txt
0,"I'm 29, female and i live in the UK. My background with depression is that i started suffering from it significantly when i was 18 and have been on various antidepressants since. I've recently come off Effexor (venlafaxine) after about 5 years of being on it, at mostly the 150 mg dose, and this has been the only antidepressant that's properly helped me. Two months ago i decided to come off it, as id been wanting to at least lower the dose i was taking, for some time. Also my doctors surgery are now ""funnier"" about prescribing it to new patients because of the reports of heart murmurs among some patients. I've been taking citalopram, at either 20 mg or 40 mg but i don't really like these medications and after this month is up I'm hoping to come off them, either to go on something else or to stop taking antidepressants altogether, those are my options. But the truth is ..... and my doctor is wondering as well .... what medications would i go on next? I've felt pretty rotten lately and the citalopram has done little for me except negative stuff, it makes me want to just take the venlafaxine again!

You'd think after 50 years of being married they would have something INTERESTING to say. But no, not MY family. Boring stuff there. Then I test drove the Camaro that I'm trying to buy. Fun shit there. My brothers eyes were so huge when I was peeling out and stuff. I loved every second of it, trust me. Then sunday night until tonight, tuesday, I was in south lyon at my uncles house. Worked my ass off but he bought my hungting license and all my tags so that saved me $75.00 so I guess I cant complain. Came home and talked to shelbz about some people for awhile, nothing better to do.

0,"I was sexually, physically, and emotionally abused by my father, my uncle and my grandparents from the time I was five until I was fifteen. My mother had taken my father and his family to court for it but everyone said that she made me say it to get back at my father, since I was ""only five"" and ""not old enough to know anything."" None of them were punished for it and I had to keep seeing them on visitations until I was sixteen (i'm still sixteen) and I told my dad I didn't want to see him anymore. This obviously did not make him happy and he knows it is about the abuse. Every once and awhile he emails me or calls and tries to make me feel guilty about it and when he does I get upset all over again just when I had started to seem to get better. I really wanted to write a book about my life, but I figured that because my dad and his family wasn't punished or proven guilty that I'd be sued for it. I want to change my last name and then get a pen name, but my mom says I have to wait until I am eighteen. I don't exactly want to wait that long to write my book, but I feel like I don't have a choice. I've considered taking them back to court but I figured it's probably hopeless and I feel guilty and doubtful even though I know it happened. Anyways, I don't want to put my mom through all that again. A lot of times I think that I imagined it all and deny it because I wish it didn't happen. I really want to be a writer and to help people who've been abused, but without proving my abusers guilty I feel as if this is impossible, that it isn't my right. I'm scared they'd be found innocent and then try to kill me for taking them to court. What should I do? I know everyone here is having a hard time and I really don't mean to be a bother. I feel guilty just talking about it because there are so many others who've had the same thing happen to them but I really needed advice. ",phantomsgirl1_e_2_a_c3s_xx.txt
0,"What am I afraid of? That is an interesting and deadly question. If analyzed too casually it can pull you into a never-ending pit of distain for oneself � if your mind is agreeable to self-distain. My mind, it seems, has always been agreeable to self-doubt and self-deprecation. I, it must be pointed out, am not fond of such thinking and countless hours, days, weeks, in fact years have been spent struggling against this susceptibility in my mind to dwindle everything down to its most melancholy conclusion. It is not a trait I accept or a trait I allow, but is merely the default setting of my mind. To avoid this thinking is to fight against one's natural order. Is this true? I have often hoped not � and certainly many have theorized that this could change with much effort and self-improvement. Ah, yet it is a tricky beast, this black hole that sucks the energy in my mind, even the positive thought can be twisted and turned into something ugly � a sort of distorted, aching false happiness that becomes as detrimental as the illness it is meant to cure. Our lady of perpetual doubt thrives in false hope. Yet, without hope men like me do not survive. Without hope to succeed is hopeless. And although success hasn't been abundant in my life, the little that can be found in its history was certainly built on a foundation of hope and moderate self-belief. This is gobbledygook, mental masturbation, which has no readership value in the least. I am just spouting thoughts, but some of those thoughts have an eerie connection with the truth of the last 17-and-a-half years. Oh, if I could only breath the air that filled my lungs the days before my brain melted down. I know life felt differently. I wasn't the happiest of children � maybe already bent towards self-destruction or depression � but I breathed freer air. Life definitely had a different feeling, a different perception. It was much different. For a while, as a teenager, I could still recall how that felt. Not in feeling, but in memory. Now the memory is all but completely lost. All I know now is that it changed when I was 13, and despite all my growth and lifting out of this disease � it was never meant to return, that freedom. Funny, how I thought when I was 13. Despite the pain, I thought it would be all over soon. I remember thinking that in a couple years I wouldn't even remember the putrid mental stink that was skewing my vision of the world around me. I would get over it. Something would happen and this dark pit would be left behind and forgotten. The dark pit is still here. I am managing, better than most I imagine, but the horrid thing is still here. I am not sure if it ever could truly lose itself. Just its memory could insight its existence. I would have been better if it had not been born at all. Too late, it is a part of me now. A part of my history � a part of my present. My unwelcome capture. ",greg_e_1_b_1_can.txt

Just some numbers, and there she is, on the other end of the line, giving me good advice and comforting me. Francina is really the only comfort i find in this new school. I felt happy, glad to be her friend and know that i can always trust in her. *sigh* Today, she is going off to Holland.

0,"Women ignore me, even here, they think I'm unworthy or too ugly to be helped. I even have the stats to prove it. Why am I so undeserving of love? I made a post yesterday today asking for help as to why I'm undatable and why no women wants to go out with me. I got 450+ views and only 6 comments, only 1 of which was from a woman. Everyone else was a male who either tried to give some advice or made fun of me. Here's proof: https://imgur.com/a/TRWg3 So if 250 women viewed my profile, only one person tried to say something. Everyone else ignored me. 1/250. 249/250 women think I'm ugly or not worthy of a relationship. Think about that. That's how unwanted I am. What if every 3 minutes, someone told you ""you're ugly, no one wants you, no one cares for you, and you will die forever alone""? That's the life I might as well live in. Let's not also forget the people that made fun of me too. I mean, what do you want me to do to get your replies, ladies? Do you want me to give you gold? Will that incentivize you to reply? The sidebar says ""A supportive space for anyone struggling with depression."" and yet people make fun of me, don't want to help, and call me ugly. I guess I'm that hopeless. Am I really a human anymore? It's human to fall in love and get into relationships and have sex and whatnot with your SO. It's human to even hookup with people. I'm not qualified to be a human apparently. I bet most people my age have had 3-4 SOs, and I've had a big fat 0. Even other people with anxiety and depression can get into relationships, when other people see them, their mental illness makes them want to care for them, but for me, they run away. It's apparent in this subreddit too. Not even worthy of being spoken to from a woman. ",throwaway49009.txt

This is the part of the post that could actually be useful for someone reading it.  Although most everyone I know that would read this is a techie.

1,"I don't know if I am allowed to feel this way I don't have many friends to start with. I mean I do, but when I count close friends, I nearly have none as I am slowly starting to lose them. I have great friends, amazing friends that were always there for me in the past, but I just don't feel any of that anymore. And yes, I know I should be considerate that they are people that have a life of their own with school and family and all their homework, but I feel in a way neglect. I asked them for once if they wanted to hang out, but they reply with ""sorry I'm busy with homework"" but then I see that they were making a costume and having a photoshoot with some other friend which would have took hours of work. I know I shouldn't say anything and I should be forunate that they still consider me their prized friend however, I feel neglected. I feel as if they don't even care or want to even care about me anymore because I'm the one always chatting in the chat, but I get short replies back once in the blue moon. It makes me feel like they just stopped because they found someone else. On top of that, they calmed they were sick and I do believe that. They actually had initially told me that they wanted to give me a present for Christmas which is rare because they never really give me things (once on a blue moon maybe) and I only give gifts to them for their birthday. But now since they are sick, I have a feeling I'm going to be told ""no, sorry I am sick and need to relax after finals"" when they always go out with their other friends for these occasions no matter what. I want to say this again, but I feel that it is not right that I am feeling disappointed and neglected because a person is allowed to do what they want. I am not not allowed to tell them what to do as they have their own life and I wouldn't like that. But please, my request is may I have some advice about or further insight about what you guys could possibly be seeing in this situation?

1,"How should i deal with angry best friend Hi guys so basically in the past year ever since I started dating a boy (he was my best friend for the most part in high school) my current best friend (a girl in my friendship group also from highshcool) and i have gotten into many fights . These fights are mainly about her arguing that she is no longer my number one priority and that she is just second priority to my boyfriend . I do not think this is true and they are both important to me but In very different ways - he in a romantic way and she in a friendship way. She recently came back from overseas and I organised to meet up with her and we did. I never heard from her initiating a meet up for the next few weeks or so but I finally did initiate a catch up with her after hearing nothing from her for weeks. however this plan fell through because I ended up having a work shift. Yesterday my best friend had invited me to catch up with her before she went to work (she had work at 1pm)and I messaged her asking if we could hang out until 12pm. She asked me why I couldn’t stay until 1 with her till she had to go to work and I explained it’s bevause I had invited my boyfriend over for lunch and movies at my house (this catch up with my boyfriend was meant to be another day but got postponed to the same day as my catchup with my best friend due to him getting sick). She got very angry and told me she now does not want to see me at all and cancelled the catchup because she said she felt second priority. She said She shouldn’t have to change her plans for my boyfriend who I see so much more compared to her (I would love to see her more but she never plans anything with me or when I do ask her when she’s free she always has family plans ?) She also brought up the previous weeks events of me cancelling our plans due to me having work and got angry with me for never trying to find another day to make up for these cancelled plans I tried explaining to her how important she is to me and how I don’t see her as second priority or never meant to make her feel like second priority but she is giving me silent treatment or being passive aggressive . I am tired of having to prove to her that she is important to me and I am tired of this drama . My boyfriend is so wonderful and he is always there for me and replies to me instantly and we share many things on a personal level (emotionally physically etc) so to me it seems natural that I will try and adjust my plans to try and accommodate him - as he does so much for me that nobody else does, not even my best friend. so I don’t understand why she expects to be higher in priority than my bf and isn’t happy with being the same priority as him? I am tired and confused. Don’t know how to respond to her passive and blunt messages to me after I tried apologising and explaining Please help ",soxy123.txt

She will do and excellent job.   We have officially started the wedding plans. This past Sunday we went to Guest Island Ranch in Ames to see if we could have our reception or rehearsal dinner there. It was pretty interesting especially with my overdramatic dad there.   We liked it a lot and to be honest there are not a large number of options.  So we will see on how it goes.

1,"I went over to my brother's yesterday evening to give him a demo of Knoppix. It was a CD which I got with my Dutch magazine PC-Active. The version is 3.3 His impression before putting the CD in was that Linux was overall much to difficult to learn, after all, he'd been using Windows since he has a PC - which is a fair few years now. When the KDE desktop appeared with working sound his face simply lit up. He didn't have to say anything, I could hear him think ""wow!"". We had a look through the main menu-structure and just ran a few programs - Mozilla, KMail, KStars, the Control Centre. He was simply impressed. I have to say, even from the CD, Knoppix is fast and reliable. He's now going to play around with the CD for a while and will probably get more enthousiastic as time goes by. In a couple of weeks (days?), I expect a request to make him a permament install on his hard-drive. He had just had a lot of virus-related problems and his windows-box had grind to a halt a couple of days ago. He was very interested in learning that with this operating system, no more of that would happen. He was also worried he wouldn't be able to do the things in Linux he did under Windows, but after showing him OpenOffice.org, this was no longer an issue.  Oh, by the way, there is a new version of Knoppix, 3.4 - read all about it on the  urlLink Knoppix website ",3311843.200405121.male.41.txt

I'm a 24 year old male and I've had problems with depression for as long as I can remember, though it's become worse over the last year or so. I was pretty heavily involved in music and martial arts for years, but I'm no longer motivated to do either. I'm still going to school, though I have no real direction and I'm afraid that my lack of motivation is going to cause me to screw that up too.  I started having anxiety attacks about a year ago and they've increased in frequency the last few months. They're (not to sound melodramatic) the hardest thing I've ever had to deal with. If I'm in panic-attack mode, any slight pain or discomfort quickly becomes a life-threatening illness that is surely going to kill me in the next few minutes. As ridiculous as that sounds, it's absolutely real when it's happening and I live in almost constant fear it's going to happen again. I have a hard time even driving anymore (especially on the freeway) and increasingly rely on my girlfriend for menial things like going to the store. She is very supportive and is aware that something is wrong, though I don't think she understands to what extent. I've started completely avoiding any situation in which I have to meet new people and have a hard time even talking to people I don't know on the phone. These symptoms have been increasing in intensity over the last 6 months or so and exponentially for the last 3 weeks (I just lost my job). It seems like quite a few of you have been dealing with these sorts of things for much longer and I'm sorry if my posting here so soon seems insensitive, but its already getting to the point where I know I can't handle living like this for years on end. I've suffered from depression for (relative to my age) a long time and the anxiety attacks are absolutely terrifying (a little redundant, I know). It feels like the last year is the beginning of everything completely falling apart. I guess my posting here is a way to get the ball rolling towards getting some help. I don't have health insurance anymore and I'm not sure where to go from here. I've been medicated in the past, but I haven't taken anything in a few years. Though, without insurance I'm not even sure that's an option. That's enough for now. Thanks for providing a resource like this.

I spend an entire year teaching students to be better thinkers, writers, and people, yet only some of this shows through. Your high achievers get better, some of your middle achievers improve, and a lot of students just stay the same.  Behavior is at an all time low at this point too. Since my fifth graders don't have finals, thye've been tuning me out for the last three weeks. It's terrible. Although there is little I can do about it, I just hope that something of the knowledge and behavior skills that I taught remain with them. Maybe my modeling good behavior might just rub off on them in the long run. Who knows? Anyway, it has been a long year and I am ready for it to end. Thank God it ends next week!

He wont look at anyone when he is talking and his voice is monotone. He told us today that one of his hobbies is to go to southern California to catch spiders to keep in the class room. He also told us that his job before he was a teacher was to go through a jar of goop takeing out all the fish larva and fish eggs. he seemed pretty proud of it. I think it was pretty pathetic.

We all had this idea of living together, hanging out, have dinner get togethers with our other friends &amp; board game nights etc.. it was all great and exciting but then at day 1 after the move, our friend and her bf just kept to themselves, in their room and hardly hangs out with us. Issues came up with them not helping out with the household chores and when my bf and I brought it up, they got defensive. Then our friend informed us that she is pregnant which changes the dynamics in the house even more as they now plan to get out of our shared lease early. That leaves us to figure out how to pay for the remaining months and look for a replacement. That’s fine, it’s their decision to have the baby.

0,"Martin Luther King Jr. And depression ""As my sufferings mounted I soon realized that there were two ways in which I could respond to my situation -- either to react with bitterness or seek to transform the suffering into a creative force. I decided to follow the latter course""- King JR. Today got me thinking...We need to figure out how we can turn our discontent, anxiety, anhedonia, insecurity, self hatred, and the meaninglessness that we all feel into real world change that we can see, touch , and feel proud of in a tangible form. We need to figure out as a community, how we can re-direct our negative feelings into helping  others, and maby in the process we will be helping ourselves. I think alot of us feel meaningless, and have a hard time creating motivation to get us out of bed, besides our rare and far between moments of clarity. If we could find a way to re-direct our negative energy and encourage eachother to work towards causes we believe in, we could change the world while at the same time changing ourselves.At this point in my life, I have a ""good job"" and financial security, but I still experience horrible depression and that underlying feeling that im a failure and living a ""meaninglessness existence"". I have come to find that the only time I really feel ""alive"", or any feeling remotely resembling happiness is when I am either on drugs, or when I am helping people and making a difference. The latter of those two has actually improved my life, and I am hoping that as a depression community, we can motivate eachother to help re-direct our sadness to further causes that are meaningful to us, and hopefully squash our cynicism.

I've been with depression for the past 4 days already, I even had suicidal thoughts. Last night I was looking for a HotLine to call and tell my story, I felt like I needed to talk to somebody. I have friends, but not those type of friends that you can rely on, tell your story, and cry on their shoulders. Basically, i'm by myself in this world. I love my parents, but I never tried talking about it because I just can't.

Bad communication indeed, she needs to pay more attention to what I say. I haven't eaten for a day because the depression has gotten worse .. last night a good ""cyber - friend"" logged on, and I knew I could talk to that person .. she's not kid, she's a grown woman (40 years old), she has kids, so I knew she would understand perfectly. She talked me into not thinking about suiciding because of that. Last night was the day that I cried the most, in my entire life. I'm still depressed, a little bit relieved because I actually talked to someone and let all that out. I just need advices, I've been thinking of that girl ALL the time .. I wrote her letters as a ""secret admirer"", the ending of the letter was always the same: ""To the world you might be one person, but to one person you might be the world.""

1,Dealing with a narcissistic mother Ok. I live at home after graduating from college with my mom because I'm in the process of planning my career and finding a job to move out eventually. The thing is its like being in hell when you have a mother with clear mental problems bullying you all the time. She constantly needs attention and if she doesn't get it she changes the locks or threatens me with an eviction notice or tries to remove all the food from the house knowing I don't have anywhere to go and I'm doing all I can as fast as I possibly can to move out. I don't eat much because even if I consume a dollar to 4 dollars worth of food a week she still says I'm eating her out of house and home. I work on my portfolio from sunrise to sunset daily so I'm in my room 90 percent of the time but she accuses me of being secretive because she can't know every little thing I do. She doesn't believe in boundaries and my mental health has suffered greatly because of it. It is now to the point where I've become severely suicidal at times because I feel as if every step I take to start my life away from here she pulls me back 5. What should I do?  I have no where else to live or go. ,NubianLotus.txt
1,"It's true, mobile phones are great devices.  I've had one since i was 13, plan of course, not shitty pre paid which Evan always complains about, and, I've always had a regular wage earning job to pay for my phone bill.  But why are phones so great? Because they are becoming more stable, smaller/bigger, better battery life and more reliable.  I change phones every now and again, having had the ever popular Nokia 3310 for 2.5 years, followed by a Sony Ericsson T610 for 8 months, an N-Gage (POS) for a month, a Nokia 7650 for a month (old, but top phone), and currently, have a brand spanking new Sony Ericsson K700 in my possession which I've had for the last week, not even out here yet. Take a look at my precious:  http://www.gsmarena.com/sony_ericsson_k700-692.php  New, small, super tankish battery life, and a whole load of features. And yes, I can control my mobile phone bill, but a phone is essential for me as I need to be picked up from all the places I go, unless otherwise catching public transport.  But, Evan is against the 90% or whatever it is of Australians that own and use a mobile phone. ",3758260.200407090.male.16.txt

I don't cook very often and I'm not that good at it, so when I made the soup it seemed to turn out pretty good. I was kinda proud of my attempt and wanted my dad to try it to see what he thought of it. I brought him a small bowl to try it, and I know he was joking but it really hurt my feelings. He says to me as I hand the bowl to him, ""It's not poison is it?"" What do you guys think? Do you think it was just harmless joking?

0,"Hi, I am Ellen a.k.a. Froggie girl62, a 43-year-old female who has been depressed for life. I have been labeled as having dysthymia in the past. Although it was never officially shared with me, I believe from what I have read that I was depressed even as a child. I graduated college the first time in 1985 with a BA in Sociology with Medical Emphasis and have worked in the medical transcription field for 19 years. I have become bored with the job and dissatisfied with being forced to work from home. (Majorly boring!) Last year I started going back to school to pursue a Masters in Fine Arts in Graphic Design. This has been a huge challenge since I am brand new in the art field and most of the other students are already artists. In addition, I MUST work 40 hours a week to maintain my health insurance benefits. My mom has been my best friend and support person forever and now she has been diagnosed with lung cancer. She had surgery 2 months ago and just began chemotherapy last week. I have had an awful time dealing with this. Although she has been given a fairly decent prognosis, I am scared that she is going to leave me and would trade places with her in flash if I could. Truthfully I am disappointed every day when I wake up. I save lots of money on products to remove mascara, as the tears usually do the job. I had been on Zoloft 25 mg since the late 1990s and my family doctor increased it first to 50 and now to 100 mg. I have also started seeing a psychiatrist, only 2 sessions so far, so hard to say much about that. In the past when I went for counseling, they just gave me silly assignments and told me to go out and meet people. With my school work, I have enough assignments already. I found this forum from a post on another support forum. ",froggiegirl62_e_2_b_1_xx.txt

Conversation is easy and stimulating, and we've reached the point in our friendship that we can talk about some really deep and personal stuff. Even more recently, however, he has gotten in the habit of inviting along another friend, Tony, to our friend dates. I'm not such a fan of Tony.

1,"Alcoholic dad It's been like this since I was 6 years old. Just to give information, my family and I lived on a farm before I was six and I rarely got into contact with people outside of my family so I barely knew how to talk and would rather screech and be mad all the time and this led me to be very bad at my own language and have few ""real"" friends. My dad's problem started when he started drinking after the company he worked in shutdown I didn't know about it but my family fought about it without my knowing and I don't even know my siblings that well due to me never having gotten any real attention I just sat in my room while they fought at age six and played a game of Madagascar and shut it out I started understanding at age 10 how bad I was with actual relationships i barely know even now how to initiate discussions with other people or relatives and cryed, everyone started to fight at age 11 now at age 16 my dad drove me and my friend from my other friends due to us having had a LAN (played games) and he almost drove right into the railing of a bridge and that was today now that it wasn't just me who was endangered because of his fucking problem I started getting mad. He barely cares what I say and what my mom says he probably wants to leave my mom but doesn't have the financial expertise or job to do so. I dont know what to do and I barely have the guts to cut myself or anything just banging my head into a wall when my parents aren't home or watching people play games.

1,"Am I being a bad friend or is she? Hey, I'm kind of new to Reddit but I kinda need an opinion on a situation and I really hope the person I'm talking about never reads this. I have this close friend, (let's call her P) and lately, P and I have been having some problems. P is annoyed because she thinks I don't spend enough time with her. She's in one of my classes so I see her every other day for 2 hours but that isn't enough for her and she wants me dedicate my lunch time to her and spend more time texting her. She gets upset about this to the point where she sends me accusatory/passive aggressive texts during lunch about my location. Now keep in mind, I'm an honors student and I usually have club meetings or classwork to do during lunch periods and I barely see my other friends, who I'm much closer to and don't share many classes with, because of this. I'd be happy to spend time with her in a group of my friends (who she's also friends with) and spend time everyone but she gets mad or upset when I try to talk to my best friends. Also, I don't really like her personality sometimes. She's kind of vain and she flirts with my friends and she likes a lot of guys for simple reasons (i.e. this one guy who's really friendly waves at her every time he sees her in the halls and she had a crush on him for two months because of that even though he wasn't interested). And she always talks about herself and gets jealous of my friendship with the waving guy she liked, to the point where I've stopped talked to him so she doesn't tell me about her dreams in which I make out with the guy in front of her and make her really jealous. However, she cut off most of her ties with her former friend group because they talked behind her back about how she only talks about herself and the current guy she has a crush on. I understand her situation and that she feels like she's losing her only friend but I really don't like being controlled and walked on. I also feel bad about her situation and I don't want her to cry, make me look like a bad person and talk behind my back to my friends/twist the situation (which she has done before) and my friends are either telling me to cut it off with her or that I'm overreacting and a bad friend so I'm posting on here for a second, unbiased opinion.

0,"seeing other people having close, intimate relationships with each other made me so goddamn sad that I had to leave. I was at a party last night with some friends, and the whole time I saw people talking and hanging out like they were best friends and had known each other for years. It made me really sad because even though I have a wide circle of acquaintances, my mental illness and my fear of rejection makes it so hard to actually get close to people. I’ve been in college for a year and a half and I still don’t have any close friends that I text or hang out with. My friends from high school are all off at different colleges living their own lives now, so we aren’t close anymore. I kept thinking about this last night at the party and I got so sad that I left.

0,"Fuck Everything &amp; Everyone I decided to make a different account for this, because I need to get all of this off my chest. I hate myself and I hate my life. I feel trapped at an absolute dead end in my life, and I'm not even in my twenties yet. I might as well be, considering everything I have to do. I turned 17 a few months ago, and things have only gotten worse. My parents are completely delusional and can't grasp the fact that thet cause suffering for their own benefit. They would punch you in the face and find any excuse in the book to give a reason behind what they did, even if there wasn't one. My mom is an asshole, to put it nicely. She's very controlling. I've called and made my own therapy appointments only to find out she cancelled them, resulting in me having to find a different therapist AND doctor twice because they wouldn't take me because of canceling so many times, and I still haven't found either, so no therapy or medication. I have next to no friends because of how she is, coupled with my inability to speak without getting anxiety. My dad is a lazy dirtbag who fights with me constantly for no reason other than he hates me. He hates how liberal I am, he hates the people I like, whatever I like he probably hates. He sits in front of a TV all day watching shit, he bitches about anything he can, yet does absolutely nothing to fix the issue that he's the main cause of. No clean dishes? I'm in the wrong even though he doesn't rinse his or even bring them to the sink. Pills went missing? He takes more than he's supposed to and forgets and goes into a rage. So on and so forth. I honestly don't look forward to waking up anymore. I can only find peace at night and then I usually get less sleep than I should. Of course I'm 'lazy' for sleeping in. More gets done quicker in less time when I get up than the whole time they've been up. I hate this stupid town and I hate my life. It feels like I'm destined for absolute failure. School puts a heavy amount of pressure on me too. I wish I could go to sleep and not wake up, that would be ideal honestly. The list of things that make me happy and want to live grows shorter every day, and I'm so, so lost on what to do anymore. I feel so uncomfortable and just... wrong.

0,"I am lost. I do not know what to do. Hey guys. This is my first post here, I made this account because I need to vent and I have no one else to listen to me. To an outsider, my life seems okay: I am married to a great guy, I have a good job that pays well, my family is healthy and I have friends. To me, my life is unbearable. I am not ungrateful and I really do appreciate everything that I have in my life, but it is very hard for me to get out of bed in the morning and live out my day. One of my main problems is my weight. I know this may seem vain to some of you, but it is a huge problem for me, someone who already struggles with low self esteem. I have gained about 15 lbs in a year, and I cannot control what I eat, nor can I motivate myself to work out. I do not recognize myself anymore, none of my old clothes fit, and I can't seem to be able to do anything about it. Every day, I tell myself, I will eat healthy, I will make better decisions, I will not hate myself, I will not speak down to myself, etc... Each and every day, I fail. This kills me. My second problem is that I have a well paying job but it is very stressful and demanding. It takes up the majority of my day and this stress feeds into my poor eating habits. I have considered quitting but I cannot justify saying no to the money. I am scared that if I quit to try to focus on myself, I will just eat more and more because I will be less busy. I am a lazy, unmotivated person who is notorious for making excuses for herself. I really need some guidance. I hate waking up. I hate getting out of bed. I do not even want to shower or function.

1,"Is there any chance of me being able to fix the friendship? Hello all, Needing some advice on how to fix this friendship, or even if I should. So, I met this girl at a club, and before I knew it, we became great friends. She would come round my place all the time. We would drink. Have some deep conversations on really interesting subjects. And, most importantly, laugh with each other and just hang out. Being at uni and doing the same course, she would also always try to help me when I was struggling, which was something I really appreciated. Anyway, sometime before Christmas, I screwed up and hurt her feelings. She didn't tell me this, and I only know because I got it out of her - through text. I've tried to apologize to her before Christmas. No real luck. I wished her Happy Christmas and New Years. She did the same to me. Now we're both back at Uni. It got awkward, as I was with my friends and she was with her friends, both sitting at the same table. At this point, the WhatsApp conversation we had went like this:(she doesn't speak to me in person anymore or even look at me): ... [13:21, 1/22/2018] Me: Hi ....

I didn’t understand the point of life anymore and everyday driving to school I just thought how easy it was to drive off a cliff on the way to school. I got scared and told my parents who helped me get professional help. I confided in my 3 best friends at the time and almost immediately I noticed 2 of them stopped talking to me. The third I’m still friends with but not nearly as close as I used to be. When I went to college, my roommate and I became best friends but a year later, he decided to drop out and leave. I realize this is through no fault of my own but it still sucks losing a best friend. Finally, my 3rd year of college, I met the most amazing woman. With her help, I felt like I finally defeated depression. We dated for 2 years and I was so sure we were gonna last. However, I got a job on the east coast whereas we were both from the west coast. We decided we could last through the distance so I took the job and moved 3000 miles away. She just told me it wasn’t working out and broke up with me. She was my best friend and my girlfriend for 2 years. I never felt a connection with anyone else as strong as I did for her. Now I’m fearing my depression may have come back. I’m thinking I didn’t defeat depression but instead had her to use as a support. I’m here on the east coast of the US and I have no friends or family around me. I don’t know what to do and everyday I just feel like it’s me vs the whole world. I’ve already lost all hope and I feel like I don’t deserve happiness. Why else would happiness be ripped from me every time I feel like I found it. Sorry for the long post I just didn’t know where else to turn to ",doped_turtle.txt
1,"I have had it up to here! If you want to know what my life is like today, here it is in a nutshell: My name is Claire, I've just finished my GCSE exams (thank God!) I'm going to Oxford this weekend, and I am worried, stressed and pissed off simultaneously.  My brother Martin is a drug addict who has made my family's lives a living hell for the past 4 or 5 years. He is 15 in August. My parents are separated, and my dad has a heart condition. One more severe heart attack and he could die. Martin broke into my dad's neighbors house where they live in Aldridge, and now the police are looking for him.   They have just broken into my dad's house to search for him, and my dad's landlady has just called to tell him at work, so he's on his way home to do some damage control. I'm worried because my dad could get evicted as he is only renting the house, and he has worked really hard on doing it up so it will be a reasonable place to live in. He has been looking for a house for ages, but everything that seems to go right usually gets screwed up by my darling bastard little brother, so I don't know why I'm so surprised. At last count, my brother has been expelled from 3 schools and 1 college, and he hasn't attended school properly since he was about twelve.   There you have it. My fabulous life. I can't trust anyone completely in my life except for one person, who will not be named here. She is my rock to lean on, and I don't know what I'd do without her sometimes. I'm also annoyed because I don't trust any of my other friends enough to leave them in my room when they are staying over, because I think they will look for my private stuff. My songs, my stories... I have to hide everything private in my room every time they are there, and so even though people can read this I'm safe because none of my friends even know what a blog actually is. I know I sound like a melodramatic little whiner but this is seriously what my life is like. Between me and all my friends, we have enough problems to end up on Oprah or a similar show on a regular basis. This blog will be my way of telling our stories respectively.

1,"So I didn't get around to posting more earlier as I expected....I'll get better.  I'm now over halfway done with my marathon summer semester.  I never took Physics in high school.  Not sure how I passed Chemistry my junior year.  But, for now, I'm doing well in Physiology.  I'm loving it!  Science is cool.  I spent the last 20+ years fearing references to science and now I want to go out of my way to read or watch them.    Admittedly I have changed over the past year or so.  A life crisis (as opposed to a mid-life crisis which I am not old enough to have yet) let me to decide I want to go into nursing.  To do that I have to plunge into science.  Now I find its not bad.  Where did I get the impression it was?  The larger question in my mind is what happens in our schools that so many children and teens like myself end up hating science?  Can something be done to change that.  Everyone has different interests; be they theater, media, science, athletic or something else.  However, shouldn't our schools foster at least an interest or respect for all areas?  With obesity increasingly an issue athletics are important.  Science technology is equally important.  What would life be without music or theater?  In the rush to standardize test I think we are missing the large point problem.  It is that kids should enjoy school.  We have all had good teachers who make learning fun.  As a society we need to study those teachers and start pushing for more like them. ",3315556.200407020.male.36.txt

Been thinking all of last night about it and now I am pretty torn up. By no means am I a traditionally religious person. I believe in a god, Jesus died for our sins, and all that good stuff. But I don't walk around preaching and forcing what I believe onto others, instead I try and be humble. I am really struggling here with my depression here as I write this out on my lunch break at work. I don't know if I can make it through today. I just got to thinking last night and a few days before: at this point, is it faith or apathy? I just don't really care about anything anymore, not for a long time, many years, in fact. I have always run my life according to my faith. God will provide, God will meet me half way, be thankful for all that I have. I am not struggling with my faith or anything but why am I still around? What am I looking for? What am I waiting on? I am by no means struggling with my faith but rather where does the line cut off between having faith that things will turn out versus just not giving a shit about anything hoping things will turn out? I don't know, I guess I just want to lay down for awhile. Dream it all away. Pretend that life isn't bearing down on me or that I am happy. I just want it to be over. All of it. Just take me home, wherever that be. ",Lotacus.txt
1,"I'm getting annoyed constantly by one of my closest friends We've been friends since 8th grade, and she's a great friend, outgoing, funny, smart, the usual. We're pretty close, not absolute besties, but at the level where we can share memes with each other at 3am and not think it weird. But this year she's the only one of my friends from last year that has the same lunch as me, so I sit with her everyday. The problem is her bestest friend in the whole world also has the same lunch, so I'm always the awkward third wheel. I always try to help her when she needs it because a, she's my friend, and b, she doesn't have an easy home life. She never has enough to eat at lunch so I always bring something extra, and she also always needs rides everywhere. She says it's because her guardian is at work, or is visiting other family, is babysitting, but I think her family just doesn't want to give her rides places. I don't mind most of the time, but it's gotten to the point where she almost assumes we'll give her a ride when she needs it, and we can't always do that. She also stopped coming to lunch last week to go practice in the orchestra room, and I never even see her until orchestra class. I know something's not right, but every attempt to figure it out has gone unrewarded. I've made new friends this year through cross country and orchestra, and they have the same lunch I do. I went and sat with them one day, but my other friend looked almost mad when I told her I was sitting with them just for that day. It's okay for you to ignore me most of lunch and then not even show up and not answering me when I ask where you've been, but I can't make new friends and sit with them every now and then? I'm just not sure where to go from here, because I don't want to stop being friends, I really don't, but I just feel like my new friends can be better friends, and friends I can relate to better. I just don't want to do or say something I'll regret, especially because I know her life at home isn't great and she needs friends, but she shouldn't be pushing her problems onto me either ",LiviLovegood.txt

1,"Why is it that I forget information about certain people? Today, I've asked one of my female coworkers about what degree is she going for even though I keep asking that question when I forgot. She told me she's going for a dental bachelor. I've brought up that I've brought this up a bunch of times and she nodded.  I felt pretty embarrassed for asking that question and forgetting the answer a lot of times. (She isn't the only one though) I think the reason why I forget is because the front end has a tendency to have its employees to have erratic working schedules thus it doesn't help when some of the employees go to college on their days off.  I'm twenty five year old woman who doesn't go to college because I'm not too wild about school. I know a little bit about some of my coworkers, but I don't hang out with them outside the workplace because of many reasons. 1.) I don't always to make the effort to build a relationship with them because I don't have a lot to say except for questions such how's your day, what time are you working til, and anything new.  I will speak when I'm spoken to. 2.) I'm usually inside my head thinking a lot. 3.) I look for people with similar interests. (video games, animation, internet, vaporwave, and so forth on) 4.) I usually wait until someone talks to me. 5.) I don't open up to people easily. 6.) My social life is spent more online. 7.) The interests I have aren't mainstream (video games seem to be somewhat mainstream these days) 8.) I have autism while most of the employees don't have autism. 9.) I don't drive due to my fear of disability limiting my ability to drive safety. 10.) I don't talk a lot about my interests because I'm afraid I may obsess over them over and over again due to the point it may annoy co workers. 11.) I don't usually get involved with conversations with co workers because I need to focus on my job. 12.) When the time gets busy, I normally don't talk a lot. Again, I need focus on the job. 13.) I come from a solitary family from my mother's side. (introversion) 14.) I have a fear that I may say something that may offend them. 15.) I don't always have the motivation to socialize. 16.) I don't talk about my social life with family for reasons. 17.) I come across as serious, thus it doesn't help that I take a lot of things seriously I'm currently looking for free volunteer drivers in my area so I could get to places and make and keep friends.  Thankfully, I have someone at home to take me to work, but not always available to take me. Thus I can get to work by walking. (My town is somewhat walk-able) Back to retaining some information about co workers, I remember them I like some of the facts about them. I will put the first letter of my names of the co workers for privacy. Example: B is  big on cats, she has an eighteen year old daughter who used to have a pet bunny long time ago. She also love chinese as much as I do. C loves to play video games just like I do.  He doesn't like the customer is always right policy. I have a fifteen minute break for every five hours I work. The breakroom tends to vary with there's no people to there's lots of people. Some of the co workers I know use their phone to browse on the internet while eating, and I don't want to bother them while they browse on their phone. Let's face it, it's getting tougher to socialize in real life when internet's taking over everyday life. TL;DR I'd like to know why I lose track of facts of particular co workers and what could I do about it. ",TeenageWereGarurumon.txt

0,"I seem to have depression the worst, first thing in the morning lately.  Just started with a new pdoc after 7 months. with another pdoc since this latest episode occured.  My old pdoc thought I could have a mild bipolar disorder but wasn't sure.  My 20 mg of prozac had stopped working after several years of keeping me stable.  She started me on lamictal and I am now up to 100 mg / day.  Stopped the prozac in early January and got worse, but not right away.  I was having a good week / bad week type pattern depending on where I was in my menstrual cycle while I was on the prozac.  I have battled depression on and off for 20 years.  Particularly bad postpartum and this recent episode.  I am 41 years old and haven't felt this bad since I had my daughter 8 years ago. My new doctor thinks I don't have an ounce of bipolar and that I am just in a depression (I tend to agree with her).  We decided together to add Lexapro to the mix and see if that helps me level out all the days of the month.  I have been on it almost 2 weeks patiently waiting for some results - I am well aware of the waiting game.  I am also taking Xanax XR in the evenings for sleep and to avert morning anxiety.  I take my Lamictal in the morning and a very small (half of the lowest dose of xanax) as well.  I seem to get moving and can be quite productive during my day after I take the Lamictal / xanax - don't know if this is a placebo effect?? My question is, has anyone experienced this a.m. depression that seems to lift a bit later in the day?  Also, does anyone take Lamictal for unipolar depression?  The last thing I want is to be taking too much of anything and further putting off good health.  Starting to wonder if the Xanax XR in the evening is giving me this early morning dread??

1,"After much encouragement from my tech-savvy boyfriend, I’ve decided to get on board with the concept of blogging. As a writer, it only makes sense that I find an outlet to document my thoughts. However, I still kinda feel like Doogie Houser at the end of an episode when he would type a couple of sentences on his old school computer to both sum up his day and offer some sort of introspective look at the universe. Remember how he would always pause right before the last few words? That lame theme music would play as he contemplated the perfect vocabulary to capture the essence of his experience. And then he would always type the last couple of words r-e-a-l-l-y s-l-o-w-l-y. I guess that was a primitive form of blogging.   I still find the concept of putting your thoughts out for the world to read intimidating and intriguing. I mean, why would anyone care what I had for breakfast or thought of a movie I had recently seen? I guess it’s just like having a diary, but how personal can a blog get if you know everyone can read it?

I have been telling her that many of the people she surrounds herself with are very manipulative and are using her in one way of another as she has actually realized that, however she can’t seem to actually do anything about this and keeps sacrificing her own needs to satisfy those of the people around her. This doesn’t just happen once or twice, but it happens almost on a daily basis and I can basically feel her mental stability deteriorating. I have been telling her for forever that she should focus on her personal growth and leave the toxic people in her life behind.

1,"Apologise and make up or move on? Sorry it’s long, but I really need advice. I’m a girl and he’s a gay guy so there’s definitely no feelings other than friendship. He only invites me to clubs occasionally, never to hang out. I felt used &amp; that he only invites me to pay for his drinks. Most of the time he ditches me to go off with random guys. One night I was going home early and he said ‘no you’re staying at mine tonight’, but within half an hour met some guy and said he was going home with him instead- and that didn’t even end up happening because the guy had a boyfriend, so he ditched me for no reason. He doesn’t even text me, because apparently he’s a bad communicator. On the flip side he constantly refers to me as ‘one of his best friends’, tells me he loves me and wants me to be his maid of honour one day. He had a potential STI scare recently and asked if I’d go to the clinic with him. I ran out of my house and across the city to sit with him for 4 hours, didn’t even have time to brush my teeth! While we were waiting I told him this was the first time we’ve hung out outside of a club, and he said ‘it’s not my fault I’m busy’. I didn’t show it but I was really disappointed. He’s a student (as am I), not the president. He hangs out with his other friends constantly, stays at their house for a week at a time OR MORE, but has the nerve to tell me he’s too busy for me. A week later he invited me to the club again and we left and walked to the bus stop together. He got on his bus and left me alone and drunk, again. It’s also strange because he’d always invite me to stay at his after nights out, but that randomly stopped a couple of months ago. Anyway, this time I had enough and ignored his messages after that. He then invited me to the cinema and I said yes. On the day I saw that he was with his other friends instead. He called me at night and said he was ‘tired and sick’ but we could meet 2 days later. I just said ‘ok’ because I didn’t want to confront him and fall out. On the day we were meeting he text me at 5pm and asked ‘are you still up for the cinema?’ and following advice from my friends, I said ‘no thanks’ and told him it’s unbelievable that after everything hes done he chose to blow off hanging out with me to hang out with other friends, and lied about it. I also said he’s not busy, he’s just a shit friend. He said he agrees that I’m a better friend than him but he never hangs out with anyone sober and he’s trying his best. He said he was making an effort to match his actions to his words by spending time with me alone. I didn’t reply. It’s been 4 days and we haven’t spoken since. He’s been with his other friends the whole time and frankly I don’t think he’s bothered. I know it sounds dramatic but I’ve barely slept since. I’m only getting 3 hours of sleep a night and I’m really sad and can’t stop thinking about the situation. I thought we were gonna be friends forever. I love him and want him in my life but everyone says I’ve given him too many chances. I’ve been thinking about apologising and making up, if nothing else at least just so I can feel better and start sleeping again. But I don’t know how it will be received or if anything will change. I don’t know what to do but this situation is killing me and I regret causing it in the first place. If anyone has even read this, thank you ",warmwinter17.txt
1,"what is going on with my mom? As I've gotten older I identified something which was probably a source of a lot of neuroticism growing up, but I'm not really sure I'm in the right for noticing this. I have no idea what this is, I haven't met many other people that do this. But my Mom will do this thing where, the happier I get, the less comfortable she is around me. She tries almost frantically or rabidly to cut me off mid sentence or like ""steal my affectation."" Like mirroring that is a bit too eerily similar.  Its almost like a ""being a person contest."" I always feel like, gross afterward. Like someone got in my head and took a part of me then did a parody of it. It seems like nothing is going in, and only like warped versions of what I just said are coming out. Like her identity is being threatened or something. And it's only when I'm happy. She seems completely comfortable when I am depressed, and its still all out, no in. It's like she's doing a one man play. I mean I could be overthinking this, I just don't know. Is anyone skilled with like psychoanalysis or something? It seems surreal. I've rarely seen people do this. Am I doing something wrong? Like, am I not being a person right or something? She seems so unnerved by signs of happiness. It almost makes me feel fake or something. It legit feels like I'm beating her at tennis or something. Like the more emotion I am feeling naturally, she tries to one up me. And hers does not feel natural. It makes me uneasy. Is there a reason a person would do this? I really am eager to know what this is or how I can avoid it or make ends with it. ",bud_dwyer2.txt

1,"Why, hello there. Is it normally this difficult to start one of these things? I'm trying not to plunge into a sea of various results of hallucinogenics straight away, so instead I'm going to approach the problem of how I'm going to start this thing off... But I guess I already have !! Well, that was easy !!  I suppose I should introduce myself. Hi, I'm Laura. *shakes hand* I'm thirteen, and I live in a large town (or small city. But hey, the glass is half full) called Livingston, which is in Scotland, located near the capital. I was born on the 29th of September 1990, which makes me a Libra (the most utterly boring sign in the zodiac).  I go to a Catholic high school (St. Margarets R.C. Academy) which I like to refer to as ""The Convent."" I am, in fact, a baptised Catholic, although I wouldn't say that was my religion as I don't practice it (unless that couple of times that I picked up the Bible when I was in a 'contradicting everyone' mood counts...). Actually, you could say that me and God have some issues to work out. I suppose you could call me an Atheist, although I did mess about with Magik for a while...  This is like my seventh attempt at a diary, as I just seem to start them, get bored and then move on to start another one. But, as you are my diary, you are required to have a name (See? At least the Diary of Anne Frank inspired me in SOME way).  And you shall be called... Tai. I like that name, I got it off of Rhyan, who wants me to me called Tai when I become a transexual. Personally I'd rather be named Bert. That's a masculine name. I tried to look up Tai on a names and meanings website, to enlighten myself onh the wisdom behind it. This is my result:  Name: Tai Origin: Chinese Meaning: 'Very big'  ...That'll do me. *wink*  Hum. Isn't it ironic how I have just spent about an hour setting up this account and fixing my profile to look all nice, and when I start writing my first ever entry... I get writers block. Oh, speaking of irony, my friend Sian and I were in Bathgate on Monday, and as we were walking to the chippie an NHS van drove past us... and the driver was smoking.   ...Well this seems like a sufficient introduction, so I'm away laughing on a fast camel.

0,"Hello all. My name is Daniel I'm 23 and going to school in Bowling Green, Ohio. I've been diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, ADD, and depression. I've tried various medicines for my ADD and the last one I was on was Effexor XR, usually used to treat depression but can be used for adult ADD, I was on it for a year or two and kept increasing the dosage b/c I wasn't seeing enough results. The medicine dosage got too high and I had a break down during the summer of 05. To vent I would cut myself and eventually attempted suicide in a Kroger parking lot. I went to a psychiatrist and was prescribed medicines, but I've grown tired of using medicines; I had a seizure while on a drug for acne. I refused to take the medicines and have been struggling with killing myself every day. I don't really like going into public due to my social anxiety and tend to turn to computer games to escape reality. I drink more caffeine than is healthy, don't sleep at night, and have fluctuations in eating. I never think I am good at anything, I built a computer last night which kind of made me feel good about myself, but that's not enough. I've stopped going to class because I don't think I'm good enough and haven't told anyone. I'm pretty much a wreck right now and am in the process of going to the counseling center that my school offers. I don't know how much longer I can hold out before I try something else. I am struggling to even be happy around my friends, family and girl friend. They all know I think about it every day, but never say anything. It's probably because I hide my feelings and lie to them about it. I don't want to even keep going to school it feels so pointless. My girl friend wants to get married I don't even want to think about it. I don't want to get married and am too gutless to tell her. I have feelings of breaking up with her but once again I'm to scared and gutless to say anything. I hate myself. ",lamesauce_e_1_a_1_us.txt

When you feel comfortable enough, feel free to share any of your thoughts, questions, concerns, experiences, etc...Congrats on taking your first steps towards recovery! I think it takes a lot of courage to start treatment. I know it took me quite a while to admit to myself I couldn't handle my situation on my own any longer.

I hope you find therapy useful and that you and your therapist can work towards better skills to cope with the stressors in your life. Concerning your medication. There's a room dedicated to your antidepressant Prozac. You'll find lots of information there. Check it out sometime. One of the downsides of antidepressants is the fact that it takes a while for them to kick in.

Well last night I drove home and as it was so sunny I decided to take some pictures of my building to show my Grandma when I next go home.  I rang my Grandma and my sister Sindy.  I have agreed to move in with my sister next year and her boyfriend Art, if I don’t they will have to move.  Their house is really nice, plenty big enough and it would be wonderful living in London.  Plus I think I will feel more ‘settled’ down there.  It would be good for Art too as he will be able to use my car.

1,"So we did the Oklahoma thing.  It was actually a very beautiful lake.  On Saturday, as soon as we got into OK, it started pouring.  We were worried that our fun-filled weekend would be ruined because of the rain.  We had nothing to do.  We decided to see DODGEBALL, which was silly.  When we came out of the movies, the sun was out and the sky started to clear.  We dashed over to the lake to rent a kayak.  It was really nice and not too hot since it had been raining all day.  We then ate dinner at a local restaurant.   Sunday's weather was better.  My husband enjoyed the scuba diving, though it was not my cup of tea.  I am not certified and just sat on the shore, under the trees, trying to avoid the sun.  I told him that I might not go with him the next time he decided to dive, since it is not very interesting for me.  I know he enjoys it so much, but is definitely not a spectator sport.   I am teaching classes in a summer program for high school students.  It is going well, though some of the kids don't seem to care very much about the program.

1,"Apologizing to a family member ? Not sure if this is the right place to put this?  If it’s not feel free to direct me!  To sum it up,  I’ve highly offended a family member of mine.  I wrote this apology that I can’t bring myself to send them.  I kept telling them how much I wanted to see them and I even flew up to see everyone.  When we were all seated at a restaurant I was having really bad anxiety and didn’t really speak to anyone.  He took this really personal and felt I came off as an asshole.  I didn’t know how to explain the anxiety part of things to him so I gave him a lame excuse about eating spoiled food the night before.  While it was true it wasn’t the reason I wasn’t speaking to anyone.  Then I had went to his house to try and speak to him as I was leaving the next day and he told me not to come.  I did anyway and you can imagine that didn’t end well at all.  He won’t talk to me.  I finally found the courage to type up this apology.  It explains the conditions I suffer from, how they’re debilitating and the trauma I endured that caused them.  The apology I feel is oversharing but I also wanted to explain myself in full and be as genuine as I possibly can.   Nobody knows the things I went through but I’m going to post the apology here for you guys to read for yourselves.  Please don’t judge me too harshly I just don’t want this family member to never talk to me again.   I understand it may come off as a pity me type of thing but I promise it’s not. Here it is : I just wanted to let you how sorry I am.  I should’ve apologized sooner but I wanted to give you time.  I’d like to fully explain myself.  This is really long but it’s genuine.  And I’m not justifying myself in any way as I fully understand that I’ve crossed boundaries and disrespected you but I also want you to have a better understanding of what really happened.  Hear me out before you roll your eyes at what I’m about to say.   Some of this won’t make any sense initially.  But trust me it all ties together.  Whatever decision you make I’d prefer for you not to tell anyone any of this stuff.  This is why I handled certain things the way I did.  I’ve been through a lot of trauma.  Initially it was with Savannah’s dad.  He would beat me, kick me, slap, choke, etc told me my mother would be happy with me gone.  And she was aware and didn’t do anything.  This was when Jody had custody of me but I was visiting them when they had an apartment together.  Eventually I went to live with my dad and his parents.  His mom didn’t want any more kids and she was absolutely terrible to me.  She’d give me Valium to sedate me, swing pots and pans at me, threaten me with knives, lock me out of the house etc.  My dad wasn’t any better as he gave me my first black eye.  School was really difficult as I’d get bullied pretty bad and I’d get myself suspended just to avoid it.  At this point people claimed I had a behavioral issue and I was put on multiple medications I didn’t need.  His mom was able to collect SSI because of this and when Jody found this out she wanted me back.  After a year back and forth to court she won custody in January 2014.  I was 15 at this point.  She promised me a better life but it only got worse.  She kept me locked up in the house for 4 years as she didn’t want me improving and losing the SSI.  Her boyfriend also lived there, he was an alcoholic.  He’d break into my room in the middle of the night to beat and rape me.  Taunt me about how I’ve made previous suicide attempts and would go on about how he’d kill me but he figured I’d do it myself anyway.  I’ve never told anyone as I figured nobody would ever believe me.  Anyway, I was diagnosed with depression, PTSD, Panic Disorder, and social anxiety, and yet most people aren’t aware of a lot of the things I’m telling you right now.  Because of some of these conditions it’s hard for me to socialize with people for the first time.  I wasn’t trying to be distant or cold to you in person but my anxiety makes me seem that way and I’m sorry.  It’s something I’m trying to work on.  In fact it was so bad at one point I wasn’t even able to eat in a restaurant.  I couldn’t open the door if I ordered food.  I was constantly living in fear of being injured, killed, judged, any situation I was faced with I’d think of the worst possible scenario.  It’s even preventing me from getting a license.  Now, when you said I was chatty in text and not in person it really hurt my feelings and I wanted to explain but how do I explain this to somebody?  If I just said oh I have anxiety I felt as if it would’ve sounded like bs.  And I just felt absolutely terrible and I acted on an impulse and I just ended up disrespecting you and crossed boundaries I never should’ve in the first place and I am so so sorry for that.  Some of the things Aunt Connie said to me I took it to heart when I shouldn’t have and it was another contributing factor as to why I had left.  The spoiled meat story was true it wasn’t a lie.  I ate it around 1 in the morning she didn’t give it to me I wasn’t implying she did.  But it wasn’t what made me not say much.  If you were wondering why I had my luggage it’s because I figured you’d be mad,  but let me in.  I didn’t have enough money to uber all the way back so that’s why I brought my stuff.  It was idiotic I know.  I’m sorry.  Also,  I realize I’ve done things prior to this that have annoyed you.  And if I could get another chance I promise I won’t do those things again.   Sorry for those things as well.  I understand if you find it strange for me to tell you all of this but I’m sick of people not understanding how hard it is to deal with anxiety.  I wish I could do what normal people do without having racing thoughts and feeling like I’m about to pass out or worry about what people think of me or feel they’re laughing at me.  I wish I was normal but I’m not.  There isn’t an off switch.  Granted they don’t know all of this but now that you do I hope you believe me when I say it’s not an excuse.  If you have any questions about this stuff or anything in general you can ask I just hope you’re not mad at me anymore.  And maybe if possible I could come up again in a few months and try again ?  I know I gave a really bad first impression and it’s hard to shake that but I’d like to try and fix that as well.  Plus I never really got to know you all that well like I did with Aunt Connie and Uncle Paul.   And she basically told me I’m never welcome there again because I left.  I mean we texted but you get what I’m saying right ?  This is long and now I’m rambling sorry but I feel so much better now that I’ve said all this it was bothering me.  I just don’t have too many people in life right now.  And I know even when I first started talking to you on Facebook I would you send you pictures of alcohol and talk about drugs and I want to briefly go into that.  I was never hooked on anything hard.  I watched my mom lose everything from her health to her kids.  I did smoke weed, cigs, drink, and xannies.   I lived with an older cousin who pressured me but at the same time it was a way to escape my pain.   It wasn’t easy watching my mom nod out and Aunt abuse my brothers and sisters and only keep them for money.   And being stuck in that house everyday and dealing with an alcoholic.   I was never necessarily hooked on anything besides cigarettes but I didn’t want to look 40 by 30 so I quit those too.  It overall made my mental health even worse.   I finally cut all of that out and that’s when I heavily turned to food.  Then I gained almost 100 lbs and that was another reason I didn’t wanna talk to anyone because I felt absolutely disgusting but I’ve lost most of it now!  I’m back down to 180.  12 pounds until I’m a healthy weight.  But my point is I’m not that kid anymore I promise you.  I wasn’t even when I went up there there’s just more to everything than you initially see ya know?  And I’m not my mom I would never ask you for a dime.  I promise you I’m not a bad person if you really get to know me.  I’ve just had a lot of things I had to go through and I feel pretty much broken as a person but I’m trying to put myself back together it’s really difficult but I don’t have any choice but to go forward.  Believe me I still want to end it sometimes but I somehow manage to keep pushing on every day.   Talking to you, and Aunt Connie, and Uncle Paul made me feel like I had a chance of having some decent family members you know?  And I don’t really know you all that well to say how you are as a person but you seemed really nice.  And then I screwed it up with everyone.  It just made me feel like I’d finally have what I always wanted and I should’ve been realistic as I didn’t grow up with you guys, none of you know me like that, and I should’ve kept myself in line.  I just hope that you’d be willing to give me a second chance.  Again, I genuinely am sorry for all the unnecessary drama I’ve brought into your life.   But, I’m really lonely and I’d love to have some family that doesn’t hurt me.  I tried to explain the anxiety to Aunt Connie but she didn’t get it.  She thought I was just being rude whenever there was company or I was at her brothers house.  Of course I didn’t tell her everything I told you because I didn’t feel comfortable.  And it’s still uncomfortable telling you all of this but I felt that I owed you a proper explanation.  I mean I kept talking about how I wanted to see you and then didn’t even speak to you in person how much of an asshole I probably came off as. ",jadedlostsoul.txt

1,"Hopefully, you have figured out that my ""theme"" is William Shakespeare's  As You Like It . I, of course, am Rosalind, the strong-willed, independant young woman and Orlando is my lover. He left this morning and I was trying to find a way to dispense my emotions. I thought this would be much more exciting than a journal.    As I mentioned he left this morning. It is the strangest feeling for him to be so distant. Orlando holds in his chest the other half of my soul. I feel empty without him. They say ""absence makes the heart grow fonder.""

0,"Desperate for advice or input; I lost and am losing everything held dear to me right now due to multiple reasons, and would just like to hear some different recommendations I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO I DONT KNOW WHERE I WENT WRONG OR HOW TO FEEL BETTER!! I've typed this out way too many times so I'm gonna do my best to sum it up as short as I can: Last week me and my gf of 10 and a half months broke up, i was devestated. In that little time I have experienced more love, more of life than ever before and it felt like we'd been together forever. I thought, maybe we would work things out on our own and get back together when the time was right, even though i knew it was a stretch, but i was also okay with just being friends if that was what the world had planned. 2 days after the break up im talking to both of my best friends who are also (kinda?) friends with her, and they both tell me that she basically told them she had absolutely no intention of ever getting back with me because she wanted to ho around without the commitment of a relationship. She also openly bragged to one of them that she had cheated on me multiple times during our relationship. This all made me very angry and on top of that hurt. The same night just after finding all of this out I find out from my other friend that she had called her and bragged about hooking up with this one kid who, during our entire relationship, she told me she hated and that we BOTH already had bad history with, and fooled around. Then later (AGAIN) she goes on instagram live with my bestfriend who is kinda being fake just to see how she really is and openly brags about blocking me (which added to the hurt cause i had done nothing but try to respect her wishes since the split in hopes that we could at least part on good terms ya know) , saying that i was 'fucking crazy' and that she never wanted anything to do with me ever again. There's more in terms of details but thats the basic general idea of the past week for me. I dont know how i feel or what to say. I feel hurt and i feel abandoned and i feel stupid and i feel not good enough and i feel like a complete fuck up i feel so fucking awful its not even funny. Im losing my friends because my stupid brain cant get over this and im constantly going to them to talk about it because that's the way i like to deal with stuff, but they've heard the same thing one too many times and i get that i just dont know what else to do. Im tired of thinking about it, im tired of not being able to confront her but my friends say its not a good idea because its not gonna do anything but make her think even higher of herself for having fucked me up so badly and wont at all make her change her ways. I want to completely forget but at the same time a part of me wants to work everything out just so i can mean something to this person who meant absolutely everything to me at one point again, WHY?? Why does my brain, or heart, or whatever still crave attention from her, or maybe even her herself, even after knowing all of this? Why am i so fucking pathetic? What can I do to move on that doesn't involve just ignoring the problem and moving forward but rather coming to peace with it and myself and blossoming? Please, all and every opinion or suggestion is welcome. Thank you if you took the time to read this and I wish everybody the best of luck with your own problems no matter what they be.

1,"Today was Teddy Bear day at Alexander's daycare. All of the kids in his class were supposed to bring Teddy Bears, yesterday they made Teddy Bear books out of construction paper - you get the picture. Alexander does not like to get boxed in to conventional thinking so he interpreted it as ""pet"" day. This opened up his entire stuffed animal collection to be taken to school. Alexander chose his Big Bird to take to school, but it is no ordinary, stuffed, Big Bird. Oh no. This one was given to him as paybacks for some annoying toy that my wife or I gave to someone else's child. This Big Bird has a whole bunch of games that you can choose by squeezing his toes. He also has a backpack full of blocks that have letters, numbers, and shapes. You put a block into his hand and talks about it, depending on which game you picked. Sounds good on paper, right? The catch is that some deviant toy maker endowed this Big Bird with the most annoying, nasal voice - and it has no off switch. That's right. Once you awaken the bird, it starts talking, trying to get the child to play, it waits a few seconds, and then tries again, and again, and again.... Remember how I said that there is no off switch? Yeah. I imagine that the designers of this toy are in a witness protection program somewhere. Think about how this toy got made - in some corporate meeting room, an assortment of marketing, technical, sales, and other people got together - probably many times, reviewed this design, and decided that it was a good idea. Anyway, this is what Alexander took to school. I thought that I had hidden it better than that, but I was mistaken. Anyway, when I took him into his room, his teacher thought that The Bird was cute - and then he awakened it. I chose that moment to beat feet out of there. In the evening when I returned to pick up Alexander, his bird was not in his cubby with his blanket and other things. It was on top of the cabinets as far out of reach as the teachers could make it. They must not like that voice, either. ",3035529.200406301.male.37.txt

About a week ago, one of my friends whom I have known for ~4 years told her, and she said there was a high chance she would go out with me, and has been telling me stuff she has said, and he said that if I was going to ask her out, I should wait 1-3 weeks. Well, recently, they seem to be getting closer and closer to each other, and I have heard that he has a crush on her as well, and wants her to date him instead of me, and when I asked him about it, he got all defensive about it. For a little bit of extra context, he said that he wouldn't ask her out, but would be open to dating her. What should I do?

I was very skeptical of ever hearing from him again.  I still do not know what happened over graduation weekend to cause the complete lack of communication between us recently.  I guess at some level I knew that we would never be able to work things out with 800 miles between us.  I was dreaming for a little bit.  I do believe things happen for a reason, however.  I just wish I could figure out the reason for having met James at this time in my life.  It's almost scary how perfect he is for me.  We have the same stupid sense of humor and understand each other perfectly.  I can't imagine him ever being an asshole or us ever staying mad at each other.  Why does he have to move to Texas in 6 weeks?  Long distance just isn't my thing.  So once again, I will get my heart broken and recover only to move on and get it broken again.  Which I guess is the way I prefer it.  I'm too young to settle down with one man.  I just wish I would quit meeting these incredible guys at such wrong times.   When am I going to get a break in love?    On the good side, I had a fabulous weekend.  I am beginning to love my new home here.  The possibilities are endless in this area.  I am making friends and figuring my way around.  Work is good...much better than I had thought it could be.  I guess I am a true geek at heart...who would have known?  I still don't think I could live here for the rest of my life though and be happy.  I think this is a great stepping stone though for 4 or 5 years.

1,"I'm going to the party Awhile back I was out drinking with my aunt. She decided to tell me a"" huge family secret""  that my father was murdered by the guy my mom dated after he died. And that my mom was complicit. That my gramma and uncle , both dead now believed this too. That some doctor at the hospital said he looked as if he had been beaten to death. This pissed me off and confused me greatly since  my mother can't speak up for herself. She died  7 yr's ago. My aunt wasn't even there when my dad died in front if all us kids and my mom from an aneurysm when I was 2. This explains a lot about how I always felt me and my mom were outcast by my dad's family over the years. Yes my mom was a hippy and my dad's family didn't approve of her since she already had 4  kids when they married. Yes after he died she dated one of their mutual friends, who was black which they also disapproved of. That night riding my bike home from the bar I was crying and so confused praying to my mom and dad why would she say this to me? So i called my big sister/ best friend who calmed me down saying no, she was there, he wasn't murdered, my aunt just talking shit. My aunt  called me next day asking me not to tell my siblings what she said. She said she was afraid  the suspected murderer might come after her?! Anyway by that time it was too late , but i didn't tell her that. I promised not to tell. I shouldn't have lied but the whole thing was just so bizarre I couldn't keep it to myself. My brother messaged her on FB that she was wrong, that he was there and saw everything , my dad was not murdered. The fact she would say that about my mom really upset all of us.

I am savoring every moment of relaxation I have in my thirty-six hours off, though it is always difficult to resist the call of the lengthening to-do list.  In college Cynthia and I were going to make a think tank called Brains in a Vat. We would lie around thinking and writing and solve the world's problems.

What will I do if they are conservative assholes using ""Brains in a  Vat""? Closed-minded, tightass brains in a vat. I bet their logo isn't as nice as ours. I can see it now: Brains in a Jar versus Brains in a Vat. Two thinktanks battling head to head for funding. I guess if they can solve the world's problems before we can, I should commend them.

0,"I am too much of a coward to even kill myself I am posting this here, not primarily to garner attention or sympathy, but because I have nowhere else to turn and I don't know what to do with myself. I also want to try and combat some of the embarrassment and shame that I feel in regards to being clinically address, so perhaps voicing what I am thinking here, it could potentially be therapeutic for me. Now that is out of the way,this might get quite long, so I will put a tldr at the end of this. Context: I am a 20 year old girl. My whole life, my sense of worth was dictated around whether I could make the people around me happy. I had extremely strict and controlling parents and so I had no real sense of worth other than the fact that at least I didn't harbour any malicious feelings towards anyone, or try and hurt anybody deliberately. I had normal teenage 'angst' and moody, brooding periods, but absolutely not depression at all. I was completely, for want of a better word, normal. In April 2017, I first had feelings of depression, when I realised how badly I had hurt someone who used to be very important in my life. (it is an extremely long story and I am slightly more at peace with it now so I don't feel the need to explain because it would take forever). I was incapicitated for a week, I would cry constantly, not leave my bed, and my mum would scream at me and tell me she 'didn't have time to deal with my shit'. However I had a REASON for feeling this down, so whether this was the start of a biological depression, I am not quite sure. Fast forward to October 2017. This is where my current situation and problems begin. I am currently studying abroad in Japan- something I have been envisioning and looking forward to for 10 years. Honestly, I had been constantly dreaming about this for an extremely long time. It was what I felt my life was gearing towards, everything led to this. However, it all went downhill. My host family is incredibly lovely, I had made a couple friends on social media before even joining the university, and there were so many intercultural exchange opportunities to join. Yet, despite this, I could feel my mood slipping gradually. I have always been a shy person and not good with strangers, but I began to feel a creeping anxiety looming up on me, that told me to not bother others, that by interacting with others I was causing them inconvenience and discomfort, and the best thing for me to do was to just be alone. I partly attribute it to the fact I had a really awful teacher in my first semester here. Now, I think some people might think that this might be a cultural shock issue, but I am pretty sure that she was crossing ANY acceptable line, no matter what culture. Firstly she would be very rude to me in front of all my classmates. Say if I came in without makeup, in jeans (like, still showered, hair done, not sweatpants or anything, just not completely dolled up) she would say in front of everyone 'Your face isn't pretty enough to not wear any makeup. You are scaring everyone. You know girls in Japan care about their appearance. You should do too, for everyone's sake'. (Also my Japanese is perfectly adequate to understand interactions like that, so I know for a fact that this wasn't a language barrier issue. ) If I got a question wrong in class she would say 'You know, I don't know why I bother asking planyourspontaneity for answers, she is so useless'. Or if we had to make example sentences she would pick examples like 'What does planyourspontaneity need? Oh planyourspontaneity needs to learn how to make some friends'. And this became like a running joke in my class. I have never been bullied, so I never learnt to grow a thick skin, so this (what felt like) daily victimisation began to really grate and tear down my self esteem. I felt isolated so my social anxiety caused me to isolate myself, and people ignoring me, creating a vicious circle. I began to be completely mute in class, ignoring the teacher, be on my phone, having headphones in, and this obviously spurred her on as she would berate me for how I was a terrible student. Also I feel like it might be relevant to say how I told this teacher that the reason why I was so withdrawn and using my phone a lot was because my stepfather was undergoing cancer treatment and I was worried (this was true). But she still kept calling me useless and 'the worst student I have ever taught' to everyone. If I seemed withdrawn though she would stroke my thighs and lower back and neck (I think this contact thing might be a cultural difference but still) in front of everyone, which obviously made them think I was a total freak. If I made eye contact with them, they would quickly shuffle away or look disgusted. Around November-ish time I began to suffer with very extreme bouts of depression. I felt awfully ashamed- here I was living the dream I had longed for for about a decade, and I was here for some reason feeling absolutely dreadful. Even if I had had a fun day, I still had this lingering sadness, and I would get home and cry. I started seeing a counsellor which was one of the best decisions (or rather, my long distance boyfriend decided for me) I ever made. In December time it reached the point where I would barely go to class because the idea of seeing people, going to class, and even just getting out of my bed just seemed overwhelmingly difficult to me. I would cry all the time, tug my hair and cut my forearms, and would call the suicide hotline. My teacher emailed me numerous times, all very inappropriately about how her parents were dying to and how I should turn to God (not that I don't think that that is a viable avenue for some people, it just seemed like weird advice from my teacher) I tried going on anti depressants (Escitalopram?) but they made me vomit after just one pill so I stopped straight away. I travelled with my long distance boyfriend who came to Japan to see me, and felt nothing. Then I went to Nagano with my host family, and felt some kind of peace, and calmness. This calmness and general mellowness resided in me for some time, until now. Current situation: My depression came back with a vengeance yesterday during the day. At lunch time I locked myself into the bathrooms to cry and cry. I took a tranquilliser that had been prescribed for me during bouts of extreme depression to curb the urge to self harm and it did nothing. I hate myself so much. This exchange, this is what I wanted my life to lead up to, and my fucking brain is ruining it all for me. Aside from this, I had nothing to look forward to in my life. I just want to be happy, I want for people to not hate me. I know most people hate me because of the way they act around me, they won't invite me to any class activities even if I am right there, and I will be the only one not in the class group chat, class karaoke nights, etc etc. Literally the only one. I am scared of going to intercultural lounges to interact with people because they all know each other from last semester, and I can't even talk to people in real life in the first place. I just feel like an alien. I don't feel like I was meant to be born in this world at all. All I want is to be suddenly transported into a different world. I don't want to be here anymore. I just want to be asleep forever. I want to be dead. But I am scared of death. I wish I was religious so I had some motivation for either killing myself and going to heaven, or for fear of hell having motivation and stay alive. What if it hurts? What if the nothingness is unbearable? But I want to be dead. Every time I see a train go by I want to jump so badly. I know my boyfriend and family would be sad but they would get over it. He would get a better, non depressed girlfriend so he doesn’t have to deal with my shit anymore. My dad has a new daughter he treats better than he ever did me. My mum would be devastated but I don’t know if I can hold on just for her sake. Anyway, I know I am not such a loss to the world. If anything, the vast majority of people in the world would be happy because they would not have to interact with me. I have nothing to offer anyone and my existence is just a waste and if I am not happy why should I even be here.

I'm not sure but it coincides with the event and theres this subtle awkward ""accidentally"" distant attitude i feel coming from him, though I apologized for the kiss the very same day by text, that happened the morning after i slept in his bed at his party (we were 5 friends chatting in his bedroom until 6 am and the others left but we fell asleep spooning. madeout when we woke up. He has a girlfriend whos super jelly and absolutely doesnt want him to mess around, even tho he cheated on her a few weeks ago without telling. I have a boyfriend of 2 years that i love as well but we have a history of cheating on eachother and not knowing how to end this. POINT IS, i really wanna have sex with my friend right here. Once or whatever, i don't really care, but i want my hots to go away and while hes only generically attractive, with very bland taste in women (im bisexual af and i don't understand most straight men tastes alright) , hes really more than that and has some kinks i share. Plus, everyone has had some sort of relationship or hookup with eachother in the past in our friend group, and him and I are the only pair that hasn't, so thats kind of anpther thing that makes the idea awkward. Not bright. I don't know what to feel about this. I slept in his bed again last night after an intimate party with our friends because the guest room was busy. At some point I was pretty sleepy and felt his hand on my panties (i didnt have pants on because its uncomfortable), but he was well asleep. I gradually felt a tingling growing round there and it slightly woke me up, and after some time he was starting to give me hand stuff, leaned in to kiss me, and then - maybe it was because i didnt bring my toothbrush and had bad breath, i hope not for the love of god, a few seconds after that he removed his hand from what i literally had been dreaming -fuck my life for making me that horny, grabbed my boob a little and then got his hand back to him and fell asleep. I dont know why he stopped, and thats the most awlward thing : what could that mean? If we had full on sex we could both agree it was wanted but a mistake, and reveal sexual tension between us. But right now it looks like i dont really attract him at all, but he still likes some intimacy, just not with me. Is that your analysis as well? What do you guys read in this? Im well known for liking girls and have  short jaw length cherry red hair. A very cute face but Basically not your typical bombshell. Maybe that's what differences me from other girls he would dig having sex with? Otherwise...im just lost. I have no way of finding out if hes attracted to me in the slighest at the moment , and if we're not meant to bang, i really feel like we lost this kinda vibe in the past months where he would randomly text me every few days and have long, intimate convos about feelings and things happening in our lives, even if were not best friends, we got along well. (We dont really hang out alone together though, that might have happened once or twice only) I really hope i wont lose this definitely from those two awkward, unwanted situations(?) , it would really suck cause I really like him as a friend.

1,WHO TALKS TO THEIR MOTHER LIKE THIS?! my sister. https://imgur.com/a/Hj8je im sorry the screenshots arent in order idk how to arrange them and also there may be missing parts because i accidentally deleted the screenshots it doesnt really matter tho because its all un organized random crazy thoughts that dont make sense written out im 99.9% sure my sister is an un diagnosed schizophrenic and she makes things up and or exaggerates certain things that happened she will snap on anyone for anything. this time she snapped on my mom for not answering the phone she does this all the time shes actually not going as hard as she usually does because she usually gets gory when going off like this. nobody puts up with her except my mom because my mom feels bad for her and has let my sister convince her that her upbringing was the cause of her misery when thats not true at all . we all had a decent childhood and my mom treated us like gold as children. walter is my fathers name and vinny is her ex boyfriends name. my father has never beaten or raped anyone . she acts more delusional as the years go by and keeps making things up about the past. she has stabbed her ex bf and threatened to stab my mom and gone to jail for these things she also has been put into the mental hospital a few times but she always manipulates her way out . i really dont know why my parents put up with her . i blocked her number so my mom wouldnt recieve these terrible messages but my mom got mad and said i had no right to do that and makes it sound like she deserves to read these things . my sister got a new number and started texting her these things again and when i offered to block the new number my mother declined. im lost. ,BeautifulSweetDream.txt
1,"Trying to repair a lost friendship First time poster here so sorry if I don’t explain things very well So a few months ago I went on a trip with my friend and both of our boyfriends. I got a little controlling with the planning of the trip and that caused some tension. And after they went to a party they didn’t want us accompanying them to I got upset and distanced myself a little. This lead to her boyfriend and I having an argument. Where he stated if I weren’t a girl he’d ‘bash me’. After this we haven’t spoken but the friend recently contacted my mother to check in on how she was with some local flooding. This has made me think that she still cares for me, and I still greatly care for her. I’m having trouble approaching how to contact her. And while I know that it was said in anger I feel like I deserve an apology from her boyfriend, or at least reassurance that he won’t ever actually attack me. Is it unreasonable to want an apology from him? Should I let it go? I feel I should also note I do have sever anxiety, that’s why I struggle with situations like these so much. ",TeaMarieArt.txt

If you read the title you're probably thinking my father was the reason of my issues. He was not, I loved him very dearly. I am extremely sad he passed away while I'm in such a young age (I'm 21) but c'est la vie I guess.. The reason I'm now less likely to commit suicide is actually I won't / can't do this to my mother. We had to plan and pay for the funereal and oh my days it's expensive. Already we were on the line of poverty, and this didn't quite help. I just can't do it to my mother to spend even more money that she doesn't really have. So now the feeling of guilt 'if' I were to do it is bigger than my misery.

1,"Sick and tired of my family and my sister's fiance So what I'm about to share is a very, very long story so I'll try to shorten it without leaving out too much info for better context of the situation. My fiance, we've been together for 3 years, is currently in basic training. There were a few rough patches before he left, partly due to the fact that he wanted to get married before leaving. I love him to death and I know he wanted to get married to get the benefits started but I didn't want to base our marriage off of benefits. I know it won't be and I know he wants to do his best to help us. When I asked why he joined, he said one of the main reasons is to provide more for us and to take care of me, which I'm grateful for but I never wanted him to feel like it was all on his shoulders. That's why we planned to move out towards the end of the year and why I'm on college, to be independent, have stability and create my identity. Now for background info, my fiance and I have been living with my sister and her fiance along with our younger brother; our brother has Autism.  Our mother lost the house due to her opioid addiction and we found a place for us to rent together. Our dad left the state the summer before my senior year of high school. So as always my sister and i pick up the pieces and make sure our brother is taken care of. We all have been living together for almost 3 years. Since we've moved into our most recent house, it has been a shit show. 100% of the drama that occurs in the house is due to her fiances family and they don't even live or pay any bills here! Surprisingly after a year of being here they've calmed down but my fiance and I are tired of it. Also I need the ability to live my life and grow as an individual. Having to hold back and set aside my needs and wants is getting tiresome. I barely even want to have children of my own because ive been a parent to my own brother. I don't feel comfortable where I'm at now, I feel like I'm only here because it is convenient, I don't feel appreciated at all. I know my sister wants to keep the family together, or what little we have left but I need room to breathe. Also when I was 16 her fiance offered oral sex to me, I know I should have told her but I also knew she wouldn't have believed me especially given that he is her first everything. I still feel uncomfortable  around him at times. My sister cares and trys her best. She wants to buy a house and move down to Texas, that's where we used to live before pcsing to Washington state. I understand the position she was put in, we both had to endure the chaos that was our family these last few years, well since I was in the 8th grade really. However, her goals and mine don't align and I don't feel like compromising those for anyone else anymore. My fiance and I just want some peace and the ability to deal with our own problems, in peace without hearing people argue in the next room. We had a plan to move out towards the end of the year but he didn't want to wait. He was even going to school, he had started his first quarter. I asked him to consider the reserves because he could go to school and when he's done move on to active duty but with him being so stubborn he went active. It's not that I never wanted him to join, my father served 22 years and I want to join as well. I'll support him for however long his career will be but now I'm trying to figure out how do I move on and start my own family. Not that it'll  include children right away, but just my fiance and I. When we get married he will be my priority and my family as well, I just don't want my sister thinking I've chosen him over them. But also I need to make decisions for myself. Just about every decision I've made has always needed me to make sure I'm available for other people. I'm tired of always being available. My sister sometimes acts as if she takes care of our brother on her own but that is far from the truth. We've both had to do the same and yet I don't think she really appreciates it, at least she won't until I move with my fiance. I'm not sure if many of you are familiar with this term but enmeshment is the term I'd use to describe my family. There is no boundaries and if you deviate from their mean then you're an oddball. I know I said I'd try to keep it short and this isn't even half of it. I want and going to move with my fiance after I've graduated and we are married. He's getting deployed after OSUT, so I'm thinking it'll be best to get married after and itll keep some stress away from having to worry about doing before he leaves. I appreciate anyone that takes the time to read this, advice is greatly appreciated. ",alexrh96.txt

0,"Severe Ibs and depression combo is a death sentence Hi I posted a few times on this forum last year April sometine due to my depression and I'm posting again because well, it's back. So I'm just going to write a few things about myself and why I'm posting here. Im a 20 year old guy from London, England and I've been depressed for about 2 years now. I was also diagnosed with IBS about 7 or so years ago. I was at university for digital media and I finished. My first year but  when the second year started my IBS symptoms got worse and I was I physically unable to go. thankfully the university gave me a year off and said I can start my second year next year after I get better. However it just seems to be getting worse not better. I can barely go outside without going through severe anxiety attacks which leads to horrible pains in my stomach for which I need to go home to go toilet for, when it was really bad I would feel very faint and start having panic attacks. It reached the point where I was practically housebound. I spent like 3 months playing games, watching anime and TV shows and the pains started to get a bit better. Then 2 days ago I went toilet and it happened again, severe pain, feeling very uneasy and then boom out of nowhere crippling depression, the waves just hit me. I began feeling hopeless again, I felt unsatisfied with life. Not just my life, but life in general. Thanks to my love of Anime, Webnovels, Games and Movies I started to wish my life was like that. I know it's childish, but deep down it's just how I felt. I couldn't accept reality, it was too mundane for me and I wasn't satisfied just sitting there everyday just watching or reading things. But I couldn't do anything about it because everytime I try to do something my IBS kicks in and basically cripples me. And I know that even if I try and do something, it's not really what I want. I don't want my life to be normal. All I would really be doing is trying to avoid the pain that it will never happen. I know this is long and it might be hard to emphasize with me if you don't really understand it. But I just felt like I really wanted to say something and see if maybe there were other people like me. I guess you could say I'm looking for friends who can understand me, I'm hoping that maybe it will make living a little easier if I have people to talk about the things I love with who also understand what it's like going through depression. That's the conclusion I came up with anyway Thanks for reading ",DaMightyJex.txt

They are your first true love, never find anyone better than them. But still, they are so mad, rub it in your face that you were even with that person.

You don't like to be treated badly, you where in a relationship that was like that for 6 years, you thought that this person would be different, treat you like a queen.

1,"I was having a relatively average Friday at work when I decided to step outside for a fresh dose of nicotine and a butt scratch. As I was revelling in the sensation of my fading itch I noticed a flock of geese flying overhead. Inevitably the lead goose (I like to refer to the leader as ""the big cheese"") was cut down by a nudist pole vaulting midget (sorry, ""small person"" [I really like the brackets today]). As the two came crashing to the ground in a whirling pile of blood, puss  ; soft white bird feces I had a rather embarrasing moment of my own. A horrid scent tickled my senses. It was the kind of scent one doesn't pick up from a big cheese and a small person colliding 40 feet in the air. No, this scent was a little closer to home. Only after I felt the squishiness between my lower cheeks did I realize what had taken place. Some form of monsterous human being must have stolen my pants right off my body while I was distracted by the mid air catastrophy. This foul being then made doo-doo in my brand new Tazmanian Devil boxers before carefully placing them back on my body. A change of shorts and a roll of toilet paper later I began my hunt for the elusive undergarment defiling creature. Armed with only a plastic fork and a half burnt cigarette I patrolled the nearby streets for nearly half an hour when it hit me. Perhaps some of the other lower to middle class working folk in the area had been violated by the underpants bandit. I went to my truck and grabbed my CSI kit I ordered off the net. It arrived last night, just in time for me to uncover the mystery of the soiled ginch. Unfortunately I was unable to find any evidence outside of my own underpants. There didn't seem to be any eye witnesses either. Maybe they had been paid off or were just too afraid to talk. The bandit must have got to them.

I can't concentrate on school, i don't feel like talking to people, i don't feel like replying to messages. I don't even feel like crying anymore, i just feel like a mess.

0,"Am I the only one who believes in fantasies and lies to cope with not killing myself? I believe that one day, the girl I like will like me back. I believe that she will reconsider rejecting me, and apologize to me and we can be in a relationship as more than good friends. I believe that I will be prepared for my career when I leave college. I believe that I will find an internship this summer and every summer after that. I believe that I will impress employers with my fantastic resume. I believe that I will make lots of good everlasting friends in college and that I will make even more friends at my workplace in the next three years. The relationships with my high school friends will only strengthen and we will be a group for decades to come. I believe all of the people I know now. I believe that I will graduate in the next three years, and that I will be able to get As in my classes to increase my GPA.

1,"Should I cut my losses &amp; move on? I have a co-worker &amp; friend that I’ve gotten to know really well since we started working together almost 2 years ago. He seemed a bit socially awkward so I befriended him. We started hanging out &amp; we shared some pretty deep things with each other. He’s not big on emotions but he said he just feels comfortable talking to me about things. However, he’s a self proclaimed “bad” friend. He wants friendships on his rules, his terms &amp; there is no real sense of urgency in getting back to you.  He’ll not text me back for days. When I check on him he tells me I shouldn’t worry (I’m a worrier by nature). He says he doesn’t owe me anything yet tells me I’m one of the only people who has ever shown him unconditional love in a friend sort of way. One of my biggest pet peeves is when people ignore me. Im sure he knows that &amp; he does it on purpose at times. But, I also know that’s just who he is based on how other co-workers talk about him at work. I can be very overbearing at times myself. I try not to be but I get really insecure about our friendship if he just ignores me; like I did something wrong to warrant being ignored??!? I just feel like this friendship is so up &amp; down. He has no regard for my feelings or how his actions make me feel. He thinks emotions are dumb. He says they just cause problems &amp; people get hurt. He literally almost never shows emotion in any situation. However, I have seen him cry before &amp; I know he is capable of loving someone. He claims he has no love to give because he has such a poor opinion of himself. I’ve never had a friendship that has been this difficult to maintain. I always feel like I’m doing something wrong. It’s like walking on eggshells. I’m thinking about just ending the friendship but we still work together. I tend to get VERY passive aggressive when I am hurt. I know I will start to get that way at work toward him while he will be as polite &amp; professional as can be because that’s how he is. He controls his emotions SO well. I just don’t know what to do... TL; DR- thinking of ending a friendship with a co-worker after becoming very close, feels like walking on eggshells. ",fortunamajor1639.txt

1,"How to get over my ex best friend Ok so all throughout high school (I graduated high school 4 years ago) I had a best friend. We were sisters literally thought we would be friends forever. We graduated I got into my first relationship and we drifted apart and she never really let me know how she felt. She told me one day she wishes I would stop talking about him so much and that kind of was like ok cool that kind of sucks but not a big deal. Being in my first relationship that I’m currently still in it sucked not being able to talk about it because I was so excited. Anyways months passed and we got into an argument and basically we ended our friendship because she thought I was an awful friend because I was too busy for her. Fast forward a year after that we started talking again (I reached out, I always do) we started being “friends” again but it felt so awkward. Honestly though she’s the only one who was ever angry and made things not feel the same. On her 21st birthday she invited everyone to her party at her house but me and told me it was because we didn’t talk much and she didn’t want awkward vibes at her house. After that I just unfollowed her on social media and we didn’t talk at all. I messaged her over the summer congratulating her to see she was taking a trip to China and then she messaged me on my birthday. This all happened in 2017 so our friendship has been fucked up for like 2 years now. Because I deleted her number a while ago I decided to reach out and talk to her on Instagram saying happy birthday and hope she was doing well and she never replied and I know she saw it. So our friendship is dead. I’ve known it’s been dead too for like 2 years now but how do I stop being so damn hurt? I think it hurts even more because she truly doesn’t give a fuck and she was my best friend ever. I wish I could go back and do something else to fix it. Idk lately I’ve cried so much. I haven’t been able to find a good friend like her again even though she wasn’t THAT great. How can I stop obsessing over our friendship and just let it go? I constantly look at her Instagram to see how she’s doing and it just really sucks. :( ",twentytwopuppies.txt

1,"I Feel Lonely and Scared I'll End Up Friendless. Need an Ear. Ive come to the realization that I'm really scared I'll end up with no friends. I used to be the type who kept in touch with friends for years. But, I have either lost touch with or outgrown every friend I had in high school. The new ones I made in college are nice people for the most part and ended up being my roommate group (since sophomore year. I'm a 2nd semester junior.). But every friend group has their faults. And with this one, I don't feel like I fit in completely. 4 out of the 7 of them are know-it-alls who will try to correct you on every little thing (like one time I was exaggerating and saying somewhere had 100x more people, and one of them came out of their room and said ""Um, I think it's actually 1000x more people."") Those 4 are also really uptight, don't get my sense of humor for the most part and seem like they're always trying to school me on what's appropriate (MIND YOU I NEVER JOKE ABOUT RACE OR OPPRESSED GROUPS OR ANYTHING OFF LIMITS LIKE THAT.). I just don't always feel seen or appreciated or like my intelligence is respected. There's also one I don't even like that much (no matter how much I've tried) because she has an arrogant, self-aggrandizing, my-way-or-highway attitude. The point is I don't always feel in sync with them. Even the ones I do feel in sync with, I don't feel like they reach out to me nearly as much as I reach out them (when we're not in school). And I don't like one-sided friendships. I'm worried we won't stay friends after undergrad. Also this year, 2 of them are graduating and I have to find a new roommate to fill in the spot that'll be in my room. I'll admit, I didn't make enough effort to hang out with people outside of my dorm, and everyone had settled into their friend groups so it's harder to make friends now with the people at my school. I don't know what to do. Part of me feels this is my fault for not getting a single in the first place, and trying to join this friend group when it was already established. They eventually came to see me as a member, and we've had good times but I don't know that these are ""my people"". And part of me wants to get a single room next year, but I feel like I'll just be jumpstarting my social isolation and I'm also scaredy new roommates might be lunatics.

1,"my parents created me and ruined me my mother got pregnant with me just before she turned 15 and has always lived in a bad environment this lead to her using drugs and misusing alcohol. my father is 4 years older then my mother so he was 19 when my mother got pregnant. none of this is a problem other then my mothers bad choices. my parents split up when I was a baby and so growing up I was fed lies about both my life became a contest of who id love the most. lots of other things happen around the time I turn 10 and I then I started to live with my father and my three half brothers where taken away. my father never really did anything to help me cope with the separation and my mother has ran away by the time I found out. for the last 5 years my mother would occasionally contact me and talk about how things will change but nothing ever did. within the second year of me living with my father him and his wife decide to have a baby this happens and I get a new brother  who I am extremely attached to and love so much. This was fine until I was being neglected and cast out by my stepmother because I'm not her child and she didn't want me in the first place, she was just to desperate not to lose my father. so now that they have a baby things go her way a lot more. ( none of my family on my fathers side like my stepmother as she had a much better childhood and has become very stuck up from it ) I then stop spending as much time with them as I began to feel unwanted and my father has now become a very angry and belittling man who is uninterested in anything other than his laptop and phone. they began punishing me harshly for small things and neglecting my needs for example feeding me. because I had to earn my money to buy my own food if I didn't do everything they asked they wouldn't give me the money I needed to eat. so when I was 14 I started to lose weight as i had recently  met a boy that I liked and we would go for walks  and the obvious reason was that I couldn't afford to eat everyday but I did as my grandmother was secretly feeding me and giving me everything I needed and wanted as she noticed that I wasn't getting it. because my father and his wife are both very large people and visibly overweight they became angry that I was losing weight. they would regularly humiliate me in front of my relatives saying that I'm starving myself ( I wasn't I just really liked my now boyfriend and he enjoys walking)  the older I got the worse it become until it got to  my 16th birthday where it had gotten to the point they had gotten me my provisional driving licence and the cbt lesson so I can get a moped. this may seem nice but up until this point my birthday was just a garneted meal for me. they had also told my family to only give me money which they have taken and refused to give back no this day. their motive for doing this for me was so I had transport to the job they where forcing me to get so I had to start paying rent for my room.(my room is the place where things my father has that she doesn't like goes. this wasn't a problem to me as my father spends more money than he has on some really cool stuff) also useful information they claim money for me and have never told me this so they would also make me earn everything that I had and most of the things I had I paid for myself with the money I earned by doing everything they didn't want to do like pick my brother up from his school when he started going to the school playgroup. the only thing I didn't pay for was my phone.  when I was 15 I became qualified to look after children so they decided to misuse this and make me look after my brother more than I would have liked coz it took time away from my social life and school work. they would promise to pay for my time but they never did and in fear I would be punished and made to do more work without pay I didn't say anything. on the day of my cbt my stepmother dropped me there and then left to go see her family for the rest of the day. this is fine but I unfortunately couldn't do the practical text which was driving on the road so they sent me home early. I was stranded in a town that was very far  from the town I live in and had nobody to come get me. but luckily I found my friend shopping in the town with her brother and I went home with them. while on the way home I had text my stepmother explaining I wasn't ready to do the practical test, as it was too dangerous because I couldn't control the bike well enough to drive on a road safely. a few minuets later my father begins texting me angrily saying that ive wasted their money and to get a job ad pay for everything myself because I had apparently refused to get on the bike and just left the lesson. because of this I got home and packed a bag and went to my mothers parents house to stay and I had no intention of ever going back to live with my father and still don't as it has been 5 months since I left. when I first left I stayed at my mothers parents house which was two towns away from where my father lives. that only lasted for a night though and in that space of time he had come there to see me and bring me my phone as I had left it ( he had a tracking devise on it so he always new where I was) and has started texting me on my Facebook saying that I am just like my mother and lots of other horrible things like I'm on drugs and pregnant and that I'm a slut and he also said he was going to get my boyfriend arrested. within a week I lived in the same town as my father as I still have to attend school but I am still refusing to go back I now live with my grandmother ( fathers mother ) and occasionally live at my boyfriends house for a week or so depending how I feel . within these last two months I have been in contact with social services as I want my things and money back and I also want contact with my brother but I don't want my father or his wife  to be present during the contact as I want nothing to do with them . last week I went there with my friends that have been helping me through the satiation of seeing my brother and his wife made him tell us to get out and them when I decided to leave she slammed the door on us at first then came out saying I'm not aloud to see him again. during this time I have found out that my father has lied to me about things all my life for example he always told me that he didn't know how old my mother was. this was proven to be a lie as my mother now lives not to fa away from me as she just got out of prison and she and others have told me about how my father attended her 16th birthday party and by then she was pregnant . I know am extremely confused about trusting people and have developed some sort of mental illness that my doctor has ignored to help me with.

She was coming into town to go to a local bar, but I’m not of age yet. She told me I could come, but I figured she was just going to be there with her boyfriend and other friends who are 21. I didn’t want to sit there drinking a Sprite while they all got drunk, so I let her enjoy her evening. I figured she would celebrate later again anyway (which she is.) Today, she posts on her Snapchat story her and all our mutual friends (underage friends) drinking and having fun over in one of our friends apartments. I was not invited. I got her a gift and was ready to celebrate with her. I’m pretty disappointed, hurt, and feeling lame as usual. This has been a common theme for the past couple of years. She hangs with a select group of about 5 or 6 people who I’ve known longer than her. I don’t really get invited to anything at all, only once in a blue moon.

0,"A bad relationship and my current state of mind I'm 21 and i'm going to share some of my experience. So, i meet this girl on the internet in my later 17's , i was an active practitioner of Karate Kyokushin, Muay Thai and Box back then, i was about to enter in the amateurs and start to compete, i even went to japan 2 times on the championship and training grounds. Then, i meet this one girl , i had just left an relationship with another girl that end up with her cheating on me and well..i was even younger than now and i knew it how to fight, so..I beat the crap out of the guy and was disgusted by woman and by fighting like that again , i was so frustrated that i was traded by a 14 old boy (geez) but i overcome that. When i meet this girl (I'd call her Kim from now on) i was clear about all that situation and that i was not up for a relationship with her or anyone else. She was earning a place in my heart because Kim seems so different from other girls and was treating me well, she respected my hobbies, my dreams (it was 5 months to 18 years and i was going to join the military because IT WAS MY DREAM) and myself as a ''man''. So, she visited me, i visited her, we were 2 states of distance of each other, but ''never too far to our love don't reach each other'' bullshit (387 Miles) and of couse we started to dating and have sex, and all the vows of love, you guys know what i'm talking.. Then i was on my 18, i had finished a test if i was join the military as a seargent or if i was enter like a corporal and I WAS SUCEED \o/ . But on the other hands, Kim, that i had met 6 months ago was  through a rough part of her life, she had lost her job, she wasn't paying the bills and was about to get dumped from the house she was living (all alone) and then, i talked to my parents if i could help her by inviting her to come home with us, i was about to change my life, i was about to work twice as hard and so i did. I called her and say ''Hey, just sell your things, don't worry about it, we're gonna buy new ones baby'' Hell yea, like a fucking Alpha and she was so happy and she cried and she was all ''omg i love u so much'' Then i left all my trainings hobbies which gives me a lot of stress but i had back then a ''major reason '' for that and i was happy with her. Then Kim's past started to show up to us. A family of 5, me, my little brother, my mom and dad and now Kim. The thing is, Kim had a daughter that was with her aunts back then and she started to say she missed her, she was sad, she was feeling bad because she couldn't find a job yet (3 months had passed, it was a rough time on the Brazil enonomically speaking)but HEY, i had 2 jobs and i wouldn't give up, she was sad that i had to work so hard to : 1- Help my parents 2- ""Pay"" For her in the house. I was saving money too, because other than spending money with that 2  things i didn't have the time to do other things so some free time i had we would watch a movie, take some ice cream, have sex (a lot, geez) and that money that i was saving began to get bigger and bigger, till the point that i was thinking about buying some ground to maybe started to build our own house in the future when she get a job and started to help me . We would visit Kim's daughter from time to time and i start to love the girl, she was do damn smart but had a sadness in her that i could see, and one day in the house of Kim's Aunt, Her aunt came to me alone with Kim in the grocery store and started to say that i should stop my relationship with her. I was shocked by the comment, but cold as ice in the outside and just asked 'wth are u talking about ?"" then she started to say that Kim had beat her daughter so damn hard that almost killed her and that's why she was not with Kim anymore and she say Kim it's fckng crazy and all type of shit and i was pissed off. When we get back to home , i say to Kim what her aunt has spoken and she started to cry (and i was worried) and telled me a story (that isn't even worth bring it here for u guys) that in fact was another person who beat her daughter. Well, time had passed, we didn't talked about it anymore and we were hanging out and she turns to me and say ""What about we did a lil shot ? "" (That is the equivalent on Brazilian to ""LET'S SMELL COCAINE)i was ""What ?"" and she ""Yea, it will be fun, i will let you do it in my sexy belly if you want"" . It's unbelievable how someone so damn pretty and hot and smart and intelligent and perfect could turn into a fucking piece of shit so god damn fast. I refuse the ''offer'' and started to yell at her and started to talk some monstruous shit about it, like ""it was because of that you daughter almost died ?"" and everything, i was pissed off, sayed some shits that i shouldn't , she say it too but we overcome it. So, i was with Kim about 2 years by now AND THEN SHE FINALLY GETS A JOB. we had moved on from my parents house a long time ago but i was not happy because Kim's past started to bother me. In that time i discovery somethings new about her (with 100% sure before you ask) : 1- She did sex for money , even when she knew me and just talked to me back then. 2- Her ex was a asshole that was aprisioned . 3- She lied as fuck to me about almost everything, her life, her family (like ""my dad is dead"" type of lie), her past, her path. But this is past RIGHT ? right ? maybe i should just 'fuck off' and get back to my parents house but love is a sick joke. Let's advance some months (10), we had a baby. She is the reason that i'm here typing this now for you guys read it, because if not, it was for me being burned in hell for suicide. She of couse, hid the pregnancy , tried to abort EVEN WITH ME BEING BY HER SIDE, lied to me about birth control pills yea, but fuck it i was a man and i for sure wouldn't let my daughter be aborted , she then tried to give her for adoption and was all about ""she will trouble us, our life"" and i was about to kick her out from the house get my baby and that's it. My parents started to help me but the damage was made it already and it was about to get worst. She was my bride and guess what ? Yea, she cheat on me. I understand that sometimes i was a dick but man i was not up to be a cuck. I went crazy again, but i controled myself, i send her back to her state with 2 K of money from my own (she quited her job with 2 months of pregnancy ) . I was so god damned hurt. Cheat on me with my best friend cliché ? Wow. Then i started to think about it, he had a great body because he almost live in the gym because he didn't work and didn't have a family . But she doing that ? That hurt me a lot more than he doing it. And i was only 20 back there. She find another guy, and seems like I 'm now the aprisioned guy addicted to drugs (like her aunt had telled me ) you know ? I'm so fucking sad. I loved this girl so fucking much , i wish so fucking much to had a life with her, with her daughter, with my daughter. She left and didn't even ask about our daughter. You know how sad this is ? On the other hand, i'm so frustrated about womans and so sad that every girl that i start to like i dump her because i don't want to delay her life like KIm did to me. I'm fucking scared of relationships, i'm fucking scared of girls , i'm fucking terrified by the idea of trust anyone else then my father and my mother. i 'm not feeling like a man anymore, i'm feeling like shit. BUT i started to train again in Muay Thai and i'm enjoying it. but i feel so fucking lone because i really do everything alone. My workout, go eat some pizza, walk in a park.. i'm so alone. Well, i stopped to take drugs to feel better , i stopped with almost everything and started to go to gym and for now that is working, i'm just hope that someday in the future maybe.. Kim would become a nice person and will try to retake all the time that she is losting. ",PiacenzaAkashi.txt

0,"Check-In Post, with some info about contacting the moderators Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share. We try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. The community rules can be found in the sidebar. If you aren't sure about a rule, please ask us. If you have concerns or questions about the community policies, this is a good place to raise those as well. *** Hey everyone.  Sorry about letting the previous check-in post get archived. But I got messages in my personal inbox about the previous post expiring, and that isn't the best practice for several reasons.  It's not exactly appropriate (like going to someone's house, uninvited, instead of their office) and makes extra work for us (because we then have to keep the rest of the mod team in the loop).  Most importantly, there is no guarantee that any individual moderator will read their personal messages in a timely fashion or even be online at any given time, so it can delay action on your questions or concerns. The only way you should contact the moderators of any subreddit (unless explicitly advised otherwise) is via modmail, i.e. the ""message the moderators"" links you see in the community info in the sidebars.  If you're using an app or client that doesn't offer you an option to message the moderators, you can always send a modmail by putting the name of the subreddit, e.g. /r/depression, in the To box. We know that reddit does a pretty terrible job of making it obvious that modmail is a thing, especially for mobile users, so we don't blame anyone who doesn't know about modmail.  But we want you to be aware since it will help you if you ever have an issue where you need us, especially if you need us urgently. Thanks! ",SQLwitch.txt

1,"Advice to restore lost friendship? My cousin and I used to be best friends when we were little. We told each other everything and were inseparable. Then, a bunch of terrible stuff happened to her around middle school and in high school. She shut herself away. Even though we used to tell each other everything, she didn't talk to me as much after that. I love her, and I wanted her to know she could trust me, like she always could. But she didn't talk to me. Or anyone else. Then she moved a whole state away for a couple years. We drifted apart. Far apart. I used to consider her my very best friend, but at that point I didn't feel that way anymore. She now lives close to me again, and we have started hanging out again. I feel like we are starting to get our friendship back, but I still feel like there is something preventing us from getting back to how we used to be when we were little. She has depression and anxiety as a result of everything she has been through. I want her to know I am there for her and that she can trust me completely. I do know her well enough that I can tell when she is having a hard time with something, and today, I could tell she was struggling. I asked how she was doing, and she was upset because she and her boyfriend have been fighting a lot lately. I asked her more about it, but she didn't want to talk about it. That's completely fine; I understand. And I told her as much and also let her know I am always here for her if she needs anything. Now, I say all of that to ask this: how can I let her know that she can open up to me without sounding too pushy? I want to regain what we once had. How can I restore that closeness we used to have?

Usually i have something in my head, that keeps thoughts inside, but now its nothing here except my inner voice. If i imagine this, it looks like a big endless gray room with voiceless me and my clone somewhere in that room. Sometimes i think i can cry, but i can't even squeeze out a tear. I can show emotions, but feel nothing inside. I can smile if someone makes joke, but it's made up smile. I don't think friends know more than i told them, but i know there is something they hide from me. I go to school, but it ""feels"" like everything just passes around me, like i don't exist. I don't want anything, just go to sleep and never wake up, but it won't happen to me... I can't control anything. When i eat, food doesnt have any difference, it just fills void called hunger. I can't remember anything happened to me last 4 days. Is it bad memory or nothing really happened to me?

1,"My name is Crystal  My life story is not all that good. You may not like what I say. My father left me when I was 7. After that my mom found a boyfriend named Jim. My mom and dad are still married to this day. Still to this day there is fighting . When I was 13 my dad called and started telling me what to do with my life. But I told him off and said ""you was not in my life so don't try to tell me what to do"". When I was 14 I lost my virgenity to an asshole I thought I had it all untill some slut came around. When I was 15 I fell in love with an asshole again  He gave me a ring on my birth day. I did not know I was being treated by my boyfriend at the time. I was being treated like a dog. In my life I feel like I lose everything I have ever loved. Most of my family think I'm not ready for the world but I know I am. I'm sorry to my family for doing bad things  I'm sorry to my best friends for being for telling the truth. Some people don't like the truth most people don't Like me because I tell the truth.  Most people think I'm just like all the outher girls but as you can see I'm not. I'm just lost and crazy in this world. I feel like I don't belong in this world and know where to go.

0,"How's it going, all who read. My name is Greg, I'm 19 and have had depression for basically as long as I remember. Here's a brief history of my journey through depression and the treatments I have endeavored. I began on lexapro. It seemed to be helping and then it quit on me (or perhaps vice versa). After that I tried zoloft, and wellbutrin, but to the same effect. Then I turned my world to narcotics (mainly, marijuana and DXM). They helped ALOT, but because they are illegal, I felt a constant public stigma and guilt. I couldn't take it, despite the amazing effects of both drugs. I'm now taking Paxil CR, but I'm going to quit it because it isn't working. I'm beginning to lose hope altogether. It seems apparent to me that SSRIs just aren't for me, or maybe I just haven't found the right one. The real problem with depression is that you have to wait a month on each drug just to see it it's going to work. Those months can feel like years. Anyways, that's who I am. I hope to make a few friends here, and a lot of advice as well. Does anyone one else share these symptoms (if so, and if you think you can help contact me please): Chronic fatigue, lack of motivation/desire, inability to enjoy life, insomnia (including the other obvious and supplementing symptoms) The real killer is I know I have the potential to be someone great, but I have to become happy first...Greg ",anonymousxero_e_1_a_1_xx.txt

Clark  How are we ever suppose to grow and learn if we are constantly surrounded by people who agree with us?  When you sit and discuss a topic with someone else who has an opposing view you will learn more from that one person than if you sat and discussed that same topic with 10 other people who believe what you do.  Although, I have found some very interesting conversations start up between people with the same views who are just pondering other possibilities.  I have a friend who is interested in the building sciences like I am, the two of us can get together and just bounce back ideas about what if this were to happen or if this one thing changed wouldn’t that make a huge difference to the houses and buildings going up right now?  It’s really cool to have someone on the same wavelength as you.

She still had a boyfriend, but broke up with him about 2 weeks after we started hanging out. - June 2017 I told her I liked her as more than a friend, she didn't feel this way towards me at the time. - July 2017 she started dating a guy she already knew, we'll call him Jake. - August 2017 she broke up with Jake. Jake made her feel terrible for it and cut her off completely, leaving her to say that she hated him and wanted no part of him. - September/October 2017 she told me she's always been attracted to me, but wasn't ready for a relationship. I was in love with her at this time, after knowing her for a while and her being everything I want in someone. Suggested being FWB, which I took her up on. But whenever I tried to make a move on it, she didn't seem to want to do anything. We hung out just us 2 every day, would always be talking, but for some reason when the time came around to make a move she never seemed to want to do anything. Mid October 2017 she said how we would be better off being friends since we didn't seem to be going anywhere and that it was hurting her self esteem, and that she started talking to Jake again. She is currently still dating Jake, but from what I hear from her are on the verge of another breakup. And now I want her more than ever. I was absolutely heartbroken when she cut things off with me, and I'm still not over her. And she knows this. If she cuts things off with Jake, I don't know what to do. I want her back more than anything, but at the same time it's like she put me through such pain and I don't want to chance that happening again.

0,"This message is especially for newcomers desperately seeking a way out of the depression rut. Please read my words carefully as a lot of thought and devotion went into this: A year ago, I was stuck in the miserable rut of depression with little or no hope of finding a way out. I was attending mandatory group therapy after an attempted suicide and 72 miserable hours in the nut house. They put me on Remeron which helped a little ... taking some of the edge off the suicidal thoughts, but little else. Weeks of trying to learn cognitive behavior therapy went by and hopes of getting better were dwindling. Then one day, my best friend gave me a book which taught me how to properly apply the CBT. Many of you have tried CBT to no avail. I sincerely believe that you did not do it either properly, hard enough, and / or long enough. When retraining the mind, it's vitally important to diligently apply CBT daily for several weeks. (See my webpage for more info: Antidepressant That Works). Once this becomes a regular habit, I'm confident you will see improvement as I did. I'm positive you can do it too. It was the toughest job I've ever had to do, but it sure was worth it. Whenever a negative situation presents itself now, I just block it out and replace it with a positive thought automatically. It's hard in the beginning, but it's totally do - able. Plus, it gets easier after awhile. Then, once it becomes automatic, you don't even have to think about it. Properly applied CBT helps tremendously, but it's not a complete cure as you will see in my story. You must also take care of your body because it's what furnishes your brain with the proper nutrients. The two go hand in hand. The brain regulates the endocrine system and the neurotransmitters while the body provides the brain with the proper chemicals to do its job. Leisure activities help also. I know it's difficult for some of you to have fun, but it's important to get your mind off your problems even if just for a little while. I mention motivation in my story. Sometimes you just have to force yourself to do what's good for you even if you don't want to. Contrary to what many believe, motivation begins with action ... not visa - versa. The sooner you begin to properly apply the techniques I learned and the more effort you put in to them, the sooner you will get better. Hopelessness and doubt will be your enemy, so try to put them aside for a month as you get on the road to wellness. I have been off antidepressants for almost a year now. I feel great ... plus my concentration and comprehension are back. March 5 marked my one year anniversary without alcohol too. I'm basically drug free and am as happy as I was 5 years ago before the depression nearly ruined my life. ",seabulls_e_1_c_c4_us.txt
0,"How are you? I am not okay. I’m in a kind of adverse situation, my thoughts are all over the place and I really don’t know how to break this cycle. Basically what happened was that a few days ago, I sent my best friend a message before school, saying that I wouldn’t attend classes because I wasn’t feeling too well, that I felt like giving up and that, in case I also wouldn’t have been at school the following day, I had probably killed myself. I wasn’t joking. Sometimes I get these sort of “impulses”, most likely caused by me being overwhelmed by my emotions, my thoughts, and as a result of that, it feels as though I lose my common sense, my ability to think rationally. My thought patterns become unpredictable, but so far I’ve managed to not act on them, or else I wouldn’t be writing this right now. Currently they’ve been happening a lot more frequently than usual and that seriously freaks me out because during those times death seems like such a good solution to my problems. So, back to the story. Obviously, my friend got really concerned and encouraged me to come to her place because she’d been staying at home that day. BUT she also contacted my mom, which I didn’t know until hours later, and told her that I wasn’t at school and made a concerning remark, but I don’t know exactly. My mom started to call me like every minute and I started to panic because I thought a teacher had called her, so I didn’t pick up any of her calls. I spent the rest of the day with my friend, but called my mom in the afternoon. She asked my where I was and it sounded like she was crying and I told her that I was at my friends place, but after that she declined the call. That night I slept at my dads place, my mom called him and told him that she didn’t care anymore about what I was doing and that kind of hit me. It was the last thing I wanted to hear in that situation. I just don’t know what to do. I really do feel miserable. My friend is beating herself up because she thinks it’s all her fault and I don’t know, I just feel bad for feeling bad, if you know what I mean. That message was a cry of help in a kind of way and I don’t understand why my mom reacted the way she did. It just makes me think that maybe everyone is really better off without me. I’ve been depressed for nearly five years now, but my mom never really paid attention to it and just marked me down as lazy. I’ve been doing great for a good six months in 2017, but then somebody really important to me, somebody that kept me going, passed away in December and since then everything had taken a turn for the worse. Life has become so hard for me, I’m sleeping the days away because I can’t bear the thoughts, the guilt, because I’m too much of a coward to face reality. I’m trying, I really am, but no matter what I do, this feeling, this feeling that eradicates my will to live, remains. ",onleeace.txt
1,"Living At Home With Untrustworthy Family Member This post may be a bit long, but I really need advice , outside of the obvious ""just move out"" , which I will be doing soon, but I need advice for until I do. So I live at home with an untrustworthy uncle who has shown me that I can't trust him. He talks about people behind their back, personally talks down to me, purposely does things to hold me back (such as will place a setback in my way knowing it will affect my moving out --- he asks me to drive someone somewhere using my car during the time I have to be at work, ect.) . Anyway,  my uncle wants me to contribute to the household by paying $50.00 towards the electric bill. So I go, ""Ok, no problem."" That is a big problem because I was initially thinking I could go to a bill payment center and just directly pay it there as my debit card company (AMEX, Visa, ect) isn't accepted by the electric company. I called the electric company and was told if I go to a billpayment center that I need the bill or at least the account number. I have neither and am unable to access either because my uncle takes the bill . I have asked to see it, both asking my aunt and uncle. My aunt says ""I am trying to complicate things,"" and informed me that my uncle pays everything via his bank account,which really means to ""contribute"", I am really having to pay my uncle $50 after he pays the whole bill from his bank account. I don't want to do that because I am looking at having to give him that $50 , which is really going in his pocket, versus to the electric company, as a waste of money. I want to be sure my money is going where it is supposed to go (to the electric bill, and not in my uncle's pockets).  When my sister lived here, they let her have access to the bills and pay them or parts of them how she wanted.  We are two years apart, her being 28, and me being 26.  My uncle wastes a lot of money on hookah, and products on Amazon. He believes that my grandmother's house is his house (which is not true at all.) They, being my uncle and aunt are not allowing me to do things the way I want. I want to ensure that my money is going directly to the electric company in particularly because when I have contributed to the household as they (my aunt and uncle) have asked, I have watched my money be used in an unscrupulous manner and have had to deal with them (my aunt and uncle) basically monopolizing my time, so I can never progress with what I need to do in life, such as move out. My aunt tried to ask me how much money I bring in a month, and I refused to tell her. In my family, my family feels like if you are not forthcoming with information then something shady or bad has to be going on. In my case, that is not true. I am a young woman wanting to better herself and continue pursuing her passions (ones that actually will provide for myself and my OWN family --- children, ect if I have any) and leave a legacy behind when my time comes.  I am thinking not of just today, but later on down the line. My uncle is very immature. While his mother (my grandmother) was in the hospital due to a heart attack and stroke, he brought a random woman over and had sex with her in his mother's bed, and the girl was very loud and disrespectful considering that I am right down the hall. (Keep in mind, he has his own room on the third floor of the house where no one would be able to hear or see anything he is doing). He also has a superiority complex. My grandmother is still sick, and is supposedly coming home soon. I am trying to save so I can move, and have been the one helping my grandmother while she is sick. I am aware that I am dealing with a toxic family member (well, family members.) My uncle will downtalk me, calling me a bum, saying I don't have certain things, because he doesn't see where any of my money is at or goes (He isn't supposed to, I am a grown adult) , but at the same time, putting every road block in my way to keep me in a position where I can't get on better footing. I honestly feel my family just wants someone that they can talk about and put down. I have told my family that I don't have access to cash, so I can continue to save and move. I did say I can contribute in other ways. I have been the pariah of my family due to what a lot of people have said about me, lies and things that are untrue. I have family members that just want me to fail. I know that for sure. I have thought about waiting for next month's bill to come, and taking the account number off of it to directly pay my portion of the electric bill. To anyone who feels I may be being selfish, complaining , or lazy,  I am none of those things. I am currently working and saving money to move to another state. I was taught at an early age to trust my gut, and everything is all messed up right now. I have watched my family and am aware of how they operate. I don't want to be around people I can't trust. Family will betray you faster than your enemies. I am asking regarding this situation, what should I do and what advice do you suggest for dealing with toxic family members who make fun of your dreams and put obstacles in your way to hold you back from succeeding ? Also getting the account number off of the bill after the bill comes --- how good of an idea is that? ",nzurimalkia3.txt

1,"I am scared Hey guys, posting this on a throw away just incase. Anyway, a bit of back story: Me and this guy at work met because of our smoking habits. We both happen to smoke weed, so naturally we started hanging out together. It was all cool for a while, and then he started getting needy, trying to get whatever he could from me. He would ask for cash, ask me to buy him food, ask me for bud etc. Then I found out by mistake that he is a meth smoker, which is something I do not agree with at all. He just became more hostile around me after this point (not physically, only slightly verbally/emotionally), so I decided to slowly break the tie. So I started to ignore his messages and Facebook texts. I quit work btw (its been 6 months). He doesn't know where I live, but we both know that our town is very small. Basically everyone knows everyone here. So the chance of me meeting up with him in the future is very possible. Anyway, as bad as all that sounds, I want to try and mend the relationship. What should I do? I've added an image for reference: https://imgur.com/8fZq5JO Edit: I never blocked him, I deleted my account because fuck Facebook. ",notabot332.txt
0,"Does anyone else get very angry at just stupid little things?  It seems like over the last few months everyone around me is getting all they want out of life, and I am suffering with depression.  Which, of course, makes me feel worse and then I feel guilty for not being happy for them.  BUT, I also get angry when they ""flaunt"" their happiness around me.  My roommate just started seeing someone she met off eharmony.  We both signed up at the same time for fun, and while I was rejected time and time again, she was SO picky and then started seeing the first guy she went out with.  I am happy that she found someone and she really deserves it, but I get so ANGRY that she is constantly doing things with him.  It's like I've been replaced.  I feel like a 5 year old for thinking that, but I just can't help how I feel.  Today, for example, I asked her if she wanted to watch a movie I had gotten off our digital cable.  We have it until 9 tonight and she said she'd like to.  I was pretty excited seeing as how I hadn't been invited to a couple of events this weekend in lieu of ZACH going.  Well, she just came down stairs and said that Zach is going to be  coming over now.  This ticks me off because she broke our plans, and I don't have a way to ""escape"" when they are here.  I'm sure she's going to want to watch that movie with Zach, and, I know I'm being selfish, but I don't WANT him here tonight.  I haven't gotten to see Angela all weekend and the one night we have before going back to work HE is going to be here.  So I have to put on my happy face and pretend that I am glad for her and happy that she has someone and engage him in conversation when all I will feel like doing is crying.  It's unfair!  Why does it seem like when you are depressed, everyone around you has these GREAT things happening in their life.  Angela just got a promotion, a new car, and now a new boyfriend.

0,"Hello everyone. I'm here because I'm starting to have doubts about my mental health... First off I'm a 21 year old male college student, and up until about 2 years ago I think I've been fine...but lately I'm not so sure. For one thing I can't seem to concentrate or focus on ANYTHING anymore and it's becoming very frustrating. I find myself daydreaming or pacing only minutes after I sat down to do something important and because of it I can't get anything done. I can't even focus on things that should be fun, or the things I used to be dedicated too. I've also become very philosophical. I always find myself spending a lot of time thinking about life and death, the nature of existence, etc...But it seems like its becoming an obsession. I always feel like I'm wasting time but I can't bring myself to do anything constructive. Sometimes I'm disgusted when I realize how much time I spend simply pacing back and forth. I also can't fall asleep at night anymore...I just lie awake thinking and I can't make it stop. I also have constant fears about becoming old and having regrets about how I lived and what I accomplished. I also have constant regrets about the past. It seems like there's nothing I can do in life to satisfy myself and it driving me crazy...especially because for all the ambition I have I have no motivation whatsoever anymore. Also it's hard to explain, but I get the feeling that I can't feel life, if that makes any sense? It's like time is moving so fast that I can't even realize it.  Anyway, I was never like this before and I have no reason to be like this now. I don't have relationship problems or family problems and I'm not religious. This all just came out of nowhere with no apparent cause. Basically it has come to the point where I know something is wrong with me but I don't know what. I've kept telling myself this is nothing but its getting more intense and now I feel like I'm spiraling into a void or something. I guess I'm simply here to seek some opinions on what my problem could be. Thanks a lot for taking the time. PS I may have posted this in the wrong place but its my first post so I'm not sure...

1,"My parents’ living room is not large enough... My sister and I are visiting our parents this weekend - celebrating a family holiday. Overall it’s been a lot of fun, but this evening, there is a particular tv show that my sister and mom wanted to watch. Sister begged to get the “comfortable chair”. Mom and dad are sitting in their respective chairs. My choices are the folding chair or the floor. Also, sister’s devices are taking up the only proximate outlet, and I only have 10% on my phone battery. I am exhausted - it’s been a fun weekend but there was a lot of planning and I haven’t had much sleep. I’d really prefer to go upstairs to the bedrooms. My mom really wants me to sit with them... but I’m just too exhausted. I don’t want to spend an hour and a half on a folding chair OR on the floor. I don’t want to watch this TV show - they can watch it but I’m just not interested. I especially don’t want to spend an hour and a half in an uncomfortable chair, watching a TV show I don’t care about, with a dead phone battery. So I’m in the kitchen right now, with my phone plugged into an outlet. Debating how angry my family will get if I go upstairs and lay down. Debating if I even have enough energy to stay awake for another hour and a half. This is a small thing compared to most of the posts on this board. But dear heaven, I’m tired... ",heyrainyday.txt

0,"Depressed people get sick, too; How stigma in the medical community made me sicker I’ve often found myself in a chicken and egg situation with my doctors when it comes to depression. When I say I’m sick, they are too quick to assume the depression is the cause of my pain and not the other way around. After five minutes listening to me breathe, looking into my throat, and and touching the outside of my neck, they are stumped so it must be mental illness. It got the the point that when I was having severe abdominal pain, I didn’t go to the hospital. I had to push for any kind of testing, which took forever. When I finally found a doctor who listened to me, she told me I should have gone to the ER. Then I was depressed about that; I had let the other doctors make me doubt my own sanity. Turns out, I’ve been pretty sick and needed surgery. Nearly all of the issues they blamed on depression were due to a chronic, painful illness with no cure. It’s bittersweet, I’ve solved a big piece of the puzzle for sure. But I’m still struggling a lot. I just found out that I may be infertile. After my doctor said having a baby could help my condition. So that was depressing too. (I don’t think my depression caused my infertility. Checkmate, doctors!) I did start seeing a psychiatrist, and he is a kind man. He diagnosed me with depression and anxiety. He has never suggested that my depression is the cause of my physical problems, and he seems to be sympathetic to me as a chronic pain patient. He’s given me depression medication, but I don’t know how much it’s helping. Chronic illness is a thing that happens to people and it’s just *depressing*. I’ve always had depression, but this just makes it worse. He has never dismissed me for feeling that way or written off my pain as being in my head. Just wanted to share my experience with others who might understand. People with depression can experience health issues and get dismissed so easily. It took me years and years to get anywhere. It’s a struggle to cope with both mental and physical illness. Here’s to getting through today, friends. ",Itsalwayslupus72935.txt

About a year ago, my new doctor recognized the symptoms in me and offered me help in the form of Zoloft and some counseling which changed my life.

Anyway, went to Wal*Mart afterwards, bought some fun stuff, I love that store, it always has cool little things around there...And of course, they always stare at me saying ""buy me, buy me"".  Well I was a good girl, bought some scrapping stuff, and some other d0-dads, and I was out of there.  I had today off, went and got my haircut and went into the store (work - CVS/Pharmacy) to see what was going on with the girls.  I am a manager there (well, shift supervisor t0 be exact, but in about a year I'll have my own store as the manager).  Anyway, that was about it, came home, ate dinner, talked to a few people, and scrapped for a few hours, I am working on something special, can't tell ya in case someone reads this, I don't want to spoil a surprise...It's getting kinda late, and I have an 11 hour work day tomorrow, so I am off to the bed.

1,"How do I befriend my crush? So there's this girl (21/f) that I (21/f) really, really like. I live in a super homophobic country. I've accepted the fact that nothing can happen between us. However, she's just such, such an amazing person, that even if we weren't romantically involved, I would want her in my life, as a friend, because she's just so great - no joke. I'm not sure what her impression of me is. My crush and I actually have a ton of mutual acquaintances and friends. We've even worked together on an event before, but it was a large scale event with a large team, so I didn't really feel much. She once even smiled at me when she saw me! I have a friend who once had a guy give her chocolate that he “couldn’t finish” when we were in the library. The next day, he messaged her on Facebook, saying she probably felt weirded out by what he did – she responded to him, and they started talking to each other. They’ve now been dating for over a year. The bottom line is, with all this information in mind, how do I approach my crush to hopefully start a friendship with her? I've been warned that I should draw a mental boundary between feelings of friendship and romantic feelings, which I’m set on doing. I would do what my friend’s boyfriend did, but with these chocolate chip cookies I baked, though I'm not sure if it'd be a good idea. It would seem a little weird, wouldn’t it? Even with my friend’s boyfriend, we knew his intentions from the start. My crush and I are both girls, however, so I suppose that changes things a little (we do live in a heteronormative society). With all that said, I’m pretty desperate, as she’s graduating soon, and I really don’t want to miss my chance. She's completed all her subjects and is currently only working on her dissertation. She's often in the student lounge, doing work - though I'm not sure what her schedule is like and what days she's in campus. Please help with creative ways to approach my crush (like my friend's boyfriend did)! Thanks! ",iridescentt_.txt

1,"How to deal with indecisive parents? My parents are unbelievably indecisive. They make every single day about making a big decision about who moves to which country and it’s horrible. I’ve lived in New Zealand for almost ten years now, and three years ago my dad moved back to the UK for work. Every single day my mother asks me if she and my brother should go back and join him, and if so where am I going to live? When I was 15 I was told we were moving to Australia. I had to report this to my dean and even had to say goodbye to all my friends, only to be told (and have to sheepishly tell my friends) it was not happening after all. Now I am 21 and it does not get any easier or less embarrassing. I was really excited when they promised to put me in a dorm at uni this year. I went to boarding school and loved it so I was really excited; my mum even took me to Briscoes looking for dorm equipment for me for Christ’s sake. They got me worked up like this for a good three months before telling me it’s not going to happen after all. I mean it would have been fine if they had not got the idea in my head. I can not take it any more. It is mentally exhausting and I have spent the past 6-7 years feeling powerless and anxious. Does anyone else have such indecisive parents?

Well, not really, but I did call most of my close friends and family. (If you're reading this and wondering why I didn't call you...get over it.) Commencement went well, except for the part where I got the case with no diploma inside!:) The weekend was great, except for when I found out that I had to change my living arrangments because of someone backing out of a contract. I won't name names, but his initials are Tim Taylor.. (No hard feelings Tim :))Only four more weeks of college, and then I'll become as close to democrat as possible so that I can freeload off of society and milk the government for all it's worth until I finally land a job.

1,"Well for someone with an abundance of thoughts spilling out of her head, I'm having difficulty committing to writing them down. Maybe it's the heat, as we usually experience a much shorter summer . It's not as green and lush here as in previous summers. This global warming isn't just talk.      People are coming and going in my household. My youngest son Kevin has just returned from his week long summer camp. I was abit horrified to find that he had certainly packed along a visually controversial book for a christian based camp. I'm glad they didn't find it in his possession. They might've freaked out just looking at it, (Diablo, legacy of blood). He's almost fourteen and plays Diablo on the computer all the time. It looks like a skeletal grim reaper on the cover of it. Ahh, the joys of a young teenage boy. The sounds of his drumkit pounding on a summer's day, with our windows open for the neighbourhood to enjoy. The young teenage 'friend that is a girl' that comes to call, all giggles and cute.      My 'middle child', Kimberly, now twenty and working hard is two weeks away from flying back east to start her third year of university in Toronto. The anguish she'll experience to leave her boyfriend behind, once again. Been there, done that, but what does a Mom know. I think she's got it made, with her girlfriend in a great apartment downtown Toronto. Two girls going to school and experiencing life in a big city. Wish I had that opportunity at that age. What's the rush for commitment? I don't know too many young guys with a game plan at twenty. And that is alright, so they take abit longer to figure it out. Why botch them up forcing them to make decisions concerning women at such a young age? But I am the Mom, what do I know about such things. Hmmm.      I have one more 'child'. At this age, my least stressful one. Trevor, he's twenty-two. He's working full time, does apprenticeship training six weeks out of the year, he's doing OK, not too much to worry about there.

0,"I'm new to any kind of discussion like this.  I'm new to any kind of support like this.  I go to Therapy once a week, or rather I did, but it wasn't really making a large difference.  I'm going to be twentytwo soon, and my life is nowhere how I wish it to be.  The funny part is that to get it where I would like it all I'd have to do is go out and get a job, start working.  I just can't seem to leave the house. I'm not a shut in, or anything.  I love people.  I try and keep friends with everything, but I get self - conscious  all the time.  My early life was pretty difficult when it came to that, getting bullied badly for wearing glasses and being a bit of a dork.  I never really learned those little social rules that everyone else did.  Sometimes I just feel like I'm not on everyone's page, and nothing seems to help. I became a father at nineteen, and it was difficult.  I loved my girlfriend very much at the time, and dropped out of school to support her and our daughter.  I love my daughter, she's everything.  My girlfriend left me for another man when our daughter was four weeks old, I can't help but feel insecure about this.  Logically I should know she's just not so bright or genuine a person with me, but I can't help but feel part of it was me. She stopped letting me see my daughter a short time after, I had to go to court and battle things out.  The only accomplishment I've made in the last year that I could feel proud about was to get partial custody and three days a week with her.  I'm attentive and loving father.  I have a great relationship with my little girl. But I can't feel good about it.  Sometimes it's like, as soon as she's gone, I forget she was even here.  I spend all day in the house, like a zombie.  I'm either on the computer or at the TV, watching baseball.  I know I want to have a healthy and happy life, and I want to have money and security for my daughter, but I can't motivate myself to do anything. My parents were never attentive, and fight constantly, but I'm twentyone and should be over that.  Instead, it makes me more down now than it ever has.  I'm like a giant pit of negativity all the time.  I was involved with a girl, but that faded quick, and just like everything else it brought me down. I don't do drugs, or drink, but sometimes I really want to.  Funny part is that I've never felt any kind of relief doing them in the past.  In fact, usually my insecurities and negativity are worse. I feel like I need to get moving soon, or I'll never get moving. I tried killing myself after my girlfriend stopped letting me see my daughter, I know how bad that was for me.  I know how I made others feel, and I know how miserable I was.  I don't ever want to get that way again.  But for some reason, and I just don't understand, I can't get myself to get moving.

1,"How I'm coping with the end of a friendship... I'm writing this partly because I find it therapeutic and partly because I'm hoping it'll help others.( I have self-proclaimed good coping skills.) So, my XBFF didn't do anything [i]to[/i] me. There was no defining moment. I just decided that (as much as I love her) she doesn't compliment my life anymore. She's having a few relationship issues. As a married woman, I empathize with her. However, over the last 6 months she's started to get a little... Crazy. I'm a very blunt and controversial person. Always have been, always will be. I keep an IG account full of controversial and offensive memes. Some people like it, some people don't. Anyway, I've been going through a rough time myself so I cope by posting passive-aggressive memes. Every single thing I post she takes personally. It got to the point in which everything I said or did (online or in the real world) she somehow thought was about her. It wasn't. It got to the point in which I was afraid to speak because I was afraid she'd take something the wrong way. Anyway, she went an entire week without speaking to me even though I sent her multiple texts. Maybe this was the moment, but I decided that I will not tolerate that type of power struggle. We're adults - you don't get to ignore someone because you don't like what they're saying and that's always been an issue with her: if she doesn't like what you have to say she comes up with delusional explanations as to why. Basically, she can never be wrong and if you think one negative thing about something related to her, she'll freak out, accuse you of being jealous even though she's the one not actually happy. The negativity is starting with her. For example, we tried to book a trip together. We've been trying for years and they never happen. Finally, I just told her that I'm no longer interested in planning trips with her because she's not willing to accommodate my demanding work schedule. Now, she's the first to admit her job is shit and it's been a huge source of insecurity for her, but when I tell her that my job doesn't allow me to book off as easily as hers (she works cash and doesn't really have a true job) she'll freak out and accuse me of putting her down. No. I'm stating the facts: You can book off your job easily. I can't. That's not me putting down your job. That's me telling you why I can't tell my boss on Friday I'm leaving for two weeks the following Monday. (This is just one example, but they all pretty much follow the same context: Something TRUE she doesn't like about herself is brought to attention and she accuses you of being a bad friend.) After a week of being MIA she decides to text me. No. It doesn't work like that. I'm not interested in what she has to say. So, I tell her to get over herself, not everything in the world revolves around her, etc. Of course, she thinks she's completely innocent and that all she was trying to do was explain HER feelings and I tell her I'm not interested. Again, it's not always about her. She did not once seek clarification about ANYTHING I said. She jumped to random conclusions and just assumed I sit here and think about her. In the end, that's what frustrates me. I just can't be friends with someone who thinks everything is about her. In sum, I just decided to protect myself. ",customerservicevoice.txt

I debated getting a ring of meteorite, you know? He’s super nerdy, super cute. Science geek and all. I’d like to think every guy buying rings thinks about the meteorite ring haha. Then he tells me that he feels like a she. I loved her no matter what. I told her I still loved her and that she’s going to be one of the most beautiful girls ever. I still planned to propose. I loved her more that she’s her true self. Then my heart gets broken. She tells me that she can’t see a future with me together. She tells me that she’s only interested in women. There wasn’t much for me to do but respect her true feelings. I couldn’t force her to love me. For a few weeks I lost my best-friend and my future. We still lived together, music helped, weed helped. I made friends. I tried to be happy, and for a little I think I really was okay. But it was so stormy, one tip of the scale and I was back to being broken. Then I find out that she’s seeing other guys. My heart was gone, the only feeling is that feeling when your heart drops to your stomach. It’s a little harder to swallow, did life get harder? Did she make it easier? I don’t know. I wasn’t good enough for her. She says otherwise. I know she means the best for me with her heart but man, did it hurt the same. I ask her to give me time, as a roommate, as a past lover, give me time to heal before you see someone. Please, just give me some time to heal. But she couldn’t wait. I don’t blame her, she’s discovering herself. She’s beautiful. I never had a chance. There are better men for her. I’m broken, the pieces stomped on. I try. I go to work. I exercise. I eat healthy. I tell myself “improve for yourself and no one else”. It’s a lie. Life seems to drag on, I try to smile, I miss my best friend. I try to act like everything’s alright to her. She can’t be seeing me like this, it hurts her too. I meet a guy. He’s cute, a little simple, but cute. We start to hang out, workout together even. He takes me to some of the most beautiful places, I try to swallow my doubt and bring my heart back. Somedays, I could swallow just fine around him. When I was sure I was ready, I told him. It was too late. I took too long. I was just dead. I made plans, wrote good bye letters, planned that my little siblings would get what money I had left. I know it’s selfish, I know it can get better. I even tried to find a program that sends emails at a certain time so everyone could get a good nights sleep before they received my letter. I couldn’t do it. I stood on the edge of a bridge, the edge of a cliff, wore my favorite clothes. Listened to my favorite songs. Every time I couldn’t do it. You never think of it as someone being brave. But I was scared, I couldn’t imagine how anyone took that step off, pulled the trigger, kicked the chair. They had to be brave. And now, I’m back. I’m ready to kick the chair, I’m ready to pull the trigger, I’m ready to jump. ",KoreanKid22.txt

1,"I know that I am not alone in the 'loving the wrong man' line....   How many of us look for love in all the wrong places? How many of us confide in our best friends or our mothers (gasp!) that the man who is most important to us is unfortunately attached to someone else? How many of us intend for these things to happen? Probably none of us. We just seem to have a penchant for something that doesn't belong to us.....  And then I have to ask....does anyone really belong to anyone but themselves? Shouldn't we belong to ourselves? Shouldn't we do as  we  see fit?  No.... probably not. Because we harm others when we do this. Actually we harm ourselves, our psyches, our very souls.  We show ourselves to be without value. We are unimportant. We don't count. And we do this to ourselves.    Do we want to hurt others? No. I don't think that most of us even have any guilt about what we are doing. The man certainly doesn't. I seem doomed to be someone's midlife crisis. And no I am not that young. I am 48 years old and once again in the throes of a relationship that can only damage everyone involved.    He wants my address so that he can send me things. He actually called me once from his home. I asked him if he was out of his fucking mind. I don't know why I am doing this.  Because he smells so wonderfully fine and he tastes so good. Because he kisses like Kenny G's music sounds. Because everyone I want seems to be married ....or gay. Yes folks.... the guy that did my eyebrow piercing is a definite hottie and has two grown kids and an ex-wife and is definitely  uncloseted. And he twinkles and flirts and makes you want to well......I don't know lick him or something....sometimes I hate men.  This one tells me that I am his 'Whiskey Lullaby'.

0,"Nice to see you too!!! How are you today? I think you really have hit the mark on what I was trying to express with this question - all the negativity and darkness that is contained in almost every media outlet you can name. The disasters you mention, such real human tragedy but the way the media went after it was appalling and seemed to be muddled in politics and ratings. As for those forensic shows - ugh! I used to be able to watch them but way before this recent ""episode"" of mine I stopped. I couldn't stand the heartache of knowing what evil lurks out there. Where I work now one of the first friends I made was a gentleman who has since retired. He told me that he didn't read the news, watch TV or listen to the radio (except for light jazz) because he found that to do so was just too much pain, it did not ""serve"" him to subject himself to that kind of pain. He seemed to be generally very happy and upbeat to me so there must be something to it. As for your friend - that's a tough one but maybe since she is your friend she might understand if you explain to her how incredibly painful her TV choices are on you. Does she ever read or post here? Anyway, it is GREAT talking with you again and I look forward to the next chat. I hope you have a wonderful day and weekend. ",AOD_e_1_b_1_xx.txt
0,"Journal Entry - 12:23AM Monday, December 4th, 2017 Just thought I'd share my thoughts from last night. I occasionally lurk Reddit looking for a relatable story, so I figured I'd share some of my own thoughts. I don't want a job. The hardest part of having a job is talking. It's bad enough that I have to make eye contact. Having to speak on top of that can be nerve wrecking. Meeting new people is also tough. It's even tougher when you're the new one. Who are these people? Do I even want to know you? Are you going to try and get to know me? Am I going to allow it? Customers are easier to deal with, but just a drag to have to deal with. It can be monotonous. Often, it’s annoying. But all the while, I just feel drained. There are good days at work. But there are also bad days. And those bad days make the lasting impression, in my experience. I'm thankful for those good days. But the bad days remind me that I want better for myself. I'm tired of working in restaurants. I'm tired of wearing a stupid hat my hair can barely fit under. I'm tired of repeating phrases I'm told to repeat. I'm tired of seeing the disgusting process of how people’s shitty food is prepared. I'm tired of cooking, something I enjoy, feeling soulless. Historically, preparing a meal and feeding someone is a virtuous act, at least to me. The commoditization of it is a bit of a shame. I detest consumerism, generally speaking. Customers are not my favorite people. Along with restaurants, I hope to avoid customer interaction at my next job. I really don't want any job. When it comes to time &amp; energy vs. money, I'm all for the money until I find out what I have to do. Then my my time &amp; energy feels more valuable. Because it is more valuable.

I know it works for some people, but that stuff just makes me angry because it's *so* not me. I'm not a fighter. I don't understand how to just keep pushing and keep going on like that. I guess I've been doing that somewhat if I've made it to be 21 but I'm so fucking miserable. I don't understand how people get motivated and ""just deal with it"" and all that shit.

0,"No one has a monopoly on suffering.  We keep living our lives because depression is pain and illness is suffering, but both don't happen without something happening to us. It is at these times that we are changing in some way...Suffering can give us greater empathy and understanding.  It can strip away all the other stuff. So many say they will always be depressed ... that may or may not be the case but everyone has right to live their lives ... suffering included. However, there is a vast difference between simply suffering from depression and finding the courage to live with long term / cyclical depression.  You can, learn to live with depression.  It may profoundly change your life ... take much away from you, but you can learn to live with it.  Long term depression isn't static ... like any illness, it changes.  But we know depression is different because it so cruelly takes away our hope of a brighter future.  But be stubborn and it will change again. To state in a forum like this, that you want to end it all is a big responsibility to place on the shoulders of other people.  It hands the possibility of that personal choice on to others .... which is unfair. Genuine suffering can bring more empathy and awareness of the plight of others in similar situations. There are times when i feel like ending my life and the thoughts nudge at me constantly but I recognize them now for what they are: the depression talking.  With each episode I have learnt new ways to try and tag these thoughts.  Ultimately ... the illness is happening to me / the thoughts happen to me.  But I would not burden others with the knowledge of their presence.  It is only afterwards that i might mention that i had these constant thoughts, because to tell them in the middle of the depression would only darken their lives as much as the depression is darkening my own. Please think before you make threats of suicide in the chat room or forums.  There is an increasing number of people using this technique of gaining attention but it is unfair.  by all means we can talk about it .... but saying : ""i'm going to do it."" is simply selfish and smacks of attention seeking. Such behavior is destroying the integrity of genuine sufferers of depression in the eyes of so many.  It is eroding the help which is so lacking for so many ... and is probably the reason why the mental health hospital near me is a relic from the 60's and yet the cancer department is brand new and state of the art. Please .... stop attention seeking and stop using ""depression"" as a convenient coat hanger for emotional immaturity and lack of personal responsibility. For so many people ... this really is a matter of life and death. ",cataclyzm_e_1_b_c3d_uk.txt

1,"Is my sister (31) a toxic person, am I (28m) overreacting? Should i confront her or should i talk to a specialist for a peace of mind? Hello, 28 male. I'll try to be as brief as possible. I've never been very close with my sister. We talk and communicate and help each other (lately I'm the one helping) but I've never really... connected with her. In a few words - if she wasn't my sister I would've never consider her a friend or someone worth keeping close to me. As a child she was very abusive (maybe not the best word) in terms of getting what she wanted - tantrums, fights, screaming, being the centre of attention - you name it. Later on in her teen years she had constant fights with our parents over staying late at parties and so on. She was grounded more than a handful of times during that period. Over the years her attitude stayed the same. She has no qualms about burning bridges with people. Friends, family - you name it. If she gets in a fight with someone she would never stop and think twice before saying something that she may regret later on. Like an animal that's being threatened - bite, bite, bite. This would often lead to tentions in our family as she and the other party won't speak for couple of weeks. She has a child now (1.5y.o.) and the poor kid is truning out to be a real brat. We would go over to her house and the kid is throwing tantrums all over the place. She says ""well, he wants to sleep"" but won't go to the other room with him. In the meantime the kid is touching the food, throwing forks and we are all trying to keep all the food, beverages, our phones and what not away from him and she would say somehthing like: ""well, yea, the fun of being a parent. You'll see when you have one, ha ha"". Such a fun. And she is really obsessive. She's the one that does the talking. At this point I know everything about pregnancy, childbirth, brestfeeding, nutrition, whats good and whats bad for the kid. She and the kid are in every conversation. Some one would say ""I didn't get to clean the house this weekend"". Well guess what? She didn't get to clean the house too, because of the kid. ""Wow, house cleaning... Yeah, haven't done that in a while now. But you really can't, once you have a kid. You'll see"". She is lacking friends and communication, I can tell. All she talks about is some Facebook groups with other mothers that we don't know. We have never heard of them, we are not bothered to but here we are - we know about some random mom and her kid's sleep schedule, eating habits, inside jokes we don't really appreciate or care to. And if its not her and the kid in the centre of attention its her and my BIL fighting over stupid, stupid shit that I don't want to hear or know about. And its not only me - my gf, our parents, mutual friends and so on. We are so deep in that shit, that some of our mutual friends are making excuses to avoid them. And my sister's answer? ""Oh, they'll see! Things are gonna change between us and them. I'll see them when they have a kid"" We (me and my GF) are avoiding them too, as much as possible! But if you confront her you better be ready to go to war. She can't handle critisism. To her this means a fight. And if  get in a fight with her you better be ready for a throwdown and to hear some bad shit about yourself. Thruth is I don't want to confront her to spare my self all the drama. The yelling, the tantrums, her playing the victim how hard it is, seeking support and involving my mother for example.... It probably is hard. Sure is. But after more than six months of me helping them with their house renovation, using my car as a truck or taxi, depending on what they need (building materials, groceries, doctor appointments etc you name it) I'm kinda sick of it and lost! I really can't tell - am i overreacting over this? If not - should I confront her and hope that she will take my criticism as an adult. I'm really thinking of seeing a specialist seeking an advices and peace of mind. Sorry for the rant! Your input is much appreciated! ",Monchomozli.txt

0,"Feeling trapped in my head First off I'm Autistic, I'm studying at Oxford I'm struggling to remember anything, like anything at all, people, faces, dates, facts, etc. I'm feeling more and more alone because I don't feel like I have anything good to think about. I have a girlfriend, she's in the forces and has a lot of structure and meaning to her life and I like that but I see my life as completely pointless. So about a year I was cycling in the dark and I was hit by a car, I flew over the bonnet and hit my head. I was out for about half an hour, till I regained conscience in the back of an ambulance, and the crews were cutting off my clothes and pumping me full of morphine. Before this accident I had a very good memory, and my parent would say I could talk about anything that had happened from when I was a child. I was having some weird relationships at the time with different people, and I only came out to them after I was in hospital for a month after the accident, I didn't want to say anything because I didn't want to worry them. I valued their feeling more over my own life, and I still do that now with other people. Things started to crash after the accident, I lost people really good friends and I knew it was me, and I changed and something during that accident had altered me, and I hated it. I started to forget people very quickly and events that had happened and horribly people who had died and continuously not realising they had died. That upset a lot of people. Before everything happened I had broken up with a girl (but i didn't realise that after), now I can't remember what we did together or even how we met, but I can't get the thought of her out my head, she later told me to leave never come back, which I did. But even now I still have the feeling of thought of her, and I'm struggling to get rid of that, I don't love her and I'm not in love her, I just feel like i'm obsessed with her a person I know nothing about and It haunts me. I've been to a few separate doctors and have been recommended medication, which I believe it has just made it worse. I've talk to my parents but they just talk highly of the pro's of medication and councillors. Hate councillors. (I always ended up lying to them) Since everything I've had some real down point, and made two attempts, by failed due to people walking in randomly either whilst in progress or while setting up. I've already made necessary precautions by writing letters, addressing them and stamping them but non have been sent. I want to tell my gf but I feel like, I don't want to throw feelings away by her thinking 'he's a sobbing kid, or he's crazy or why am I with him' - I'd rather hide it not to upset her, people mean everything in the world to me, and I'd give my life for her, any day. But I still want to tell her, and I don't her to be scared of me. When I close my eyes and think of a memory, I just see grey mist or static like of a television.

My uncle  was jealous of dad in evrythng. Dad was adored by all d siblings he wasnt, coz he was grandmas eye n youngest. Actually grandma spoild him...kinda the pampered kid who is arrogant. He had his ways in evrythng.  Ok den marriage,  n kids. not bragging but i must say this...my siblings kinda ""got our shit together"" den his kids..in terms of academic performance or like social life in general...so maybe yeah that added  Again highr level of jealousy.  He evn said i got 1st rank in my high school  (which i did..nerdy days)coz its a ""rotten school"". i am in another city too now, not homwtown. Den my uncle sent his kids to outside cities too , but all faild wid single digits. Shame added to jealousy probably . after some time he bought  Hyundai i10 car. after some time Dad bought i20 too...actually the thing is it was the time when we were kinda grown up too  and a car was necessary plus  i hv four siblings so i20...mayb my uncle thought it was kinda a competition..childish i know. Bam! N then came  d issue of d ""way"".  see my dad , uncle,  and dads elder brother , they all lived together before(joint fam)....Wen they  seperatd land, they decided de sud leav 10 feet land for vehicle...lemme explain that bit. its like imaging three houses next to next and we need to leave path to the right so that we cn park beside respective house...the main entry being point being our uncle's because his house is first, middle dad then dads elder bro. my dads elder bro did(left 10feet to the side then constructed new house), dad did, he dint.  N wen dad told, he said ""u dnt evn hav a car nw(then ). I will gv way wen u buy."" N my grandparents let him hav his way. Actually its all der fault. they never take d authority.  N wen we bougt the car, he refusd straight. We dint hav place to keep our new car. We kept in a locality friend' house. Such emberasment. N uncle dint gv ""way"" all d tym. Dad didnt try to make an issue coz our grandparents wer der n he thought to make them approach n deal first.. they didnt.  They  wer too spineless. Its der land, de r parents de but  dint hav d guts to tell my uncle ...hey "" you r wrng"".  Dats why i hate dem when de dramatise to love dad when they  need money. N things remaind same.  Den grandpa was sick. then Dunno smthng hapnd, dads elder bro and another close relative were angry at my uncle for an issue. So they went to his house to talk. N he opend d door n said m busy go away and other rude things.  she (relative ) slappd him. He hit her n broke her head. Den  dad ran in(we lived next to each other so the ruckus is audible) .He broke dads nose n their head. All wer hurt but kept silent and tried to handle internally  coz he is family. Bt he sent police, to arrest dem. D police laughd n went away, saying ""u  beat them and den u  cmplained?""....from  then on der wer court cases n cases. so that was what happened.  Problem now is he moved away and now his land is bought by another relative but he still comes and make a scene. plus he poisoned his kids like "" you arent allowed to say his name (dads) in house"". its like he is using that incident  (land dispute n court cases) to dissipate all his jealousy and ego on my dad. coz there many ppl involved but he is just on my dad. i mean yeah you adults hv issues okay.. but dont spoil the next generation. i know this is getting too long n no specific questions is asked ..imma answer in comments if i get any reply lol. i just wanna get sm views and how would you handle this...plus advice because i dont wanna spoil the relationships between my cousins n us because of whatever is going on with the adults.

1,"Close friend becoming distant.... So I’ve (f,21) had a friend (m,21) that I’ve known for over two years, and we typically text or snap daily. There are times where we are texting or snapping straight for a couple of hours or we get busy with other stuff so we reply when we have a chance. Two weeks ago we had been hanging out at his place and everything to me seemed normal. Then out of the blue this week I feel as though he’s become extremely distant. He stopped basically replying to me at all. It’s been a couple of days in a row that he only responds a couple of times in the morning and then is gone during the entire day. Since I’ve known him, he has never been this way. (I'm sure some might say he's in a relationship, but he's currently single. Plus when he was in a relationship, he didn't act this way.) So last week I had sent him something early in the day and he didn’t reply until the following day. I didn’t think much of it because the next couple of days we were chatting like nothing and I was sure he was completely busy. Keep in mind, this was a couple days before he basically went blank on me. It actually got me thinking of what I had said that first day and think why he’d be so mad possibly to respond. The day that it had all started I had told him I had applied to a place and had gotten a interview the following day. I told him this even though he’s told me he’s been applying to different places and hasn’t gotten a single interview. When I told him I didn’t think that it would affect him that much since he’s told me he’d never apply to the place I’m gonna start working at. (Like he straight up told me he’d rather die than work at that place.) However, he's not the type to be petty or take things like that extremely hard and to heart. I’m not sure how I should think about all of this.I have anxiety (which is why I’m stressing) but I’m telling myself he may be going through something and I don’t want to just push him. We’ve gotten extremely close enough to the point where we’ve discussed things that are vulnerable things. He's dealt with major stuff and so have I, so I also find it weird that he wouldn’t talk to me about any of it (if it was something personal). Should I continue waiting basically a day for a response, or let it ride out and see if he gets back to himself and talks? Do you think he’s trying to ghost me? Or should I ask him what’s happening? (And if I do what should I say so that I’m not exactly targeting him). He has depression and we have discussed serious matters so I don't want to make him feel bad. Feel free to ask any questions.

1,"My Best Friend Feels More Like My Daughter I love my best friend like family and if anything were to happen to her, you can know I'd be there in an instant. But I feel awful admitting that I really don't like spending time with her anymore. We're both in our late twenties and I'm sort of the only family she has since she severed ties with her parents (a choice I completely agree was for the best). We've been best friends for the past decade and I've seen her through some really difficult times. She's faced a lot of struggles, mostly stemming from the terrible relationship she had with her family and the financial burden separating from them put on her life. Unfortunately, many of those struggles are ongoing and have really dominated our friendship. We spend more time talking about her problems than we do hanging out. I've gotten up at 3:00am to talk with her on the phone because she had a nightmare and she's scared. I've left my job early to go help her because she left hers early in tears. Days that are supposed to be fun (a movie, a game night, making dinner together) end up with me supporting her because she's upset about something, and suddenly the whole evening is gone. I don't want to exaggerate, but I'd say 70% of the times I see her I have to go into ""support mode."" And unfortunately, I've realized that I don't enjoy her as a friend and I honestly don't think I ever will again. The dynamic of our friendship has changed and it's never going to be what it was. Don't get me wrong, I care deeply for her and want to be there for her if she needs me, but the fact of that matter is I've found myself not reaching out to her anymore because it's just not a pleasant experience. When we do hang out, it's not because I want to; it's because I feel that's what she needs. She's a burden. She's a burden I bear willingly. But she's a burden. I don't know what to do. I really wish there were an easy way to say ""I don't like you anymore, so please don't be hurt that I don't reach out, but god you don't know how much I care about you."" ",ProfessorPibb.txt
1,"What is a functional family? I know what a dysfunctional family is and I have plenty of experiences from my formative years to share with y’all but, I am not going to regale you with a “woe is me” diatribe.  That’s not my objective today. My objective is to seek positive experiences to better understand the foundational attributes of a functional family.  I believe, in fact, I know these families exist based on my South American experiences from an entire society but, what about North America? Families are families no matter the country you live in but, is the lack of family attributes / cohesion as a collective whole uniquely North American for many of us but, not all? In short, let’s dig in to uncover some of these positive family attributes in my next post and I look forward to reading your responses. ",nuevoarmoredsaint.txt
0,"I made it so much worse Hey guys, haven’t been on reddit long, or this subreddit either. Never intended to post something, but recent events have changed that. So, I’ll start with some background, I’m a 17 year old high school student. My best friend is 17 too, (Who will be referred to as Golf from now on) We didn’t even know each other before the school year started, but we had a couple mutual friends and we just... connected. It’s one of those friendships where it doesn’t really make sense, to anyone, let alone either of us, it’s like we’re family. It’s the only way I can describe it. Anyway, we’re dipshit high schoolers, so we joke about depression and suicide in our friend group. The group knows Golf has depression, they have no clue about mine though. Anyway, when I started hanging out with him I did what I’ve been doing for a year and a half. Joking about my depression and making jokes about offing myself. I didn’t know Golf had it until a couple months ago, but soon after we started hanging out he started joking about it too. Well he got reported to the counseling center, a couple of times in fact. But they’re honestly useless, so it didn’t help. It came to a head last night when the group basically kidnapped him and forced him to go to a hospital. They didn’t tell me for whatever reason. I still haven’t figured out why. But eventually I got there. The night is a blur from there, I didn’t eat anything since breakfast, and that was noodles. As I’m just now typing this I realize that I’m at around 30 hours without food now. But that’s not important. I did my best to be there for Golf. He went home safe with his parents and is going to go to therapy/counseling. It was an awful day yesterday, a couple of events made Golf’s depression way worse for him. I’m glad we got him to the hospital before he hurt himself. But it’s my fault, I know it is. I don’t need you guys telling me how it isn’t either. You wont change my mind. It is my fault, I taught him that suicide and depression could be treated as a joke. I made it worse. I hate myself for it. I don’t know what to do. Hell, I don’t know why I made this post at all. I don’t know if I want advice, or vent, or see if there’s someone else out there who has gone through something like this. Right now he’s on a trip with his mom and dad golfing.  Golf (the activity) is one of the few things he enjoys. All I want to do is lay in my bed and not exist in the outside world for the rest of spring break. I don’t want to take any attention away from Golf. He deserves it more than I do. I just don’t know what to do anymore. (I’m sorry for the rambling and any punctuation/grammar errors).

She asked me to call her at about 12am because she was afraid of the thunderstorm she heard and when we got on the phone she started flirting with me. I passed it off as playfulness as she has a boyfriend but she continued. She started moaning my name over and over and exposed one of her breasts. When I asked her why she said it was ‘cute how I reacted and funny’. I have no interest in her at all and I expressed this; she apologised over text but I’m still very uncomfortable talking to her.

0,"Just wondering, for those who have had lifelong depression did you ever find some joy that wasn’t turned to a sad story? I’m starting to feel that depression never goes away, you just learn to manage it. I however, can’t recall a time in my life where I was happy. I don’t even congratulate myself when I do accomplish something. I don’t allow others to either, because it doesn’t mean much to get praised for things I should’ve accomplished a long time ago. Anyways, I’m on meds and truth is, I don’t feel like myself? I don’t think any drug can make me feel myself? Depression in some wicked way has made me become the person I am today.

1,"Where does one start?? I guess by telling a bit about who I am, where I have been and where I hope to go.  I live in Northern California in a little community called Yankee Hill. We are situated between the towns (cities??) of Chico and Oroville about 80 miles north of Sacramento. I live on 10 beautiful acres where I bring dogs I rescue from the pound (no sweet sounding titles like ""Animal Shelter"" here!!) and train them to work with people with disabilities.  One February 20th of 2004, we placed our programs first Service Dog to work with a young girl with Cerebral Palsy. It was a really exciting event and after following up on them for the past 3 months, they are doing really great.   I am now working with 3 other dogs. One is being trained to work as a the ears for a hard-of-hearing person who also seems to be picking up the tasks needed to assist someone in a wheelchair. Her name is Polly and we believe that she is a mix of German Shepherd and Yellow Lab.  Starr is a Black Lab mix and she is being trained to assist someone with a wheelchair. Her progress seems to be slower, but I am still hoping that she will pass the program. If not, we will find her a good home as a pet or possibly keep her to be our demonstration dog. The only real problem with her is that she is not real confident in big city environments. She is about 15 months old, so there is still time to help her overcome her issues.  Then we have Mocha, a Chocolate Lab. We chose her for a specific client who has a spinal condition that is making it progressively harder for him to walk on his own. Mocha is being trained to wear a harness with a handle that he can hang onto and offer him balance and stability. We have only been working with her for a couple months. She also has had some issues for us to help resolve, the most major is a fear of having either her ears or tail touched as if she was picked up by them at some time. The other is that she has had a hard time staying in one place when someone moves near her. Both of these things are being addressed and we are having great success with her developing more confidence in a variety of situations.  Well, that is a start. I'll stop here and see how this looks and pick it up again later this evening. TA TA ",3647284.200406150.male.48.txt
1,"My Wifes Car, Money, and My Brother. What do I do? My wife and I got married, but instead of an engagement ring, we decided I would buy her a car instead. I brought the Toyota and moved in. She already owned another Honda. This way we would have 2. Eventually, she gave her Honda to her brother (who was also in need), and I told her she could give it to him because her dad had initially bought the Honda anyway, not her, so he has every right to own that Honda especially since we had 2 at the time. Keep i mind that it was ultimately my decision, not hers, to let him have the car, because although I'm married to her and her dad bought her the car, I felt like since her dad ""bought"" it, he has the right to it, and since her brother is her dads ""male"" descendant, he has the right to the car. (Sorry we're an asian family) So now we have 1 Toyota (the engagement ring car). With a baby on the way, we decided we would lease another Nissan ourselves, so we could have 2 cars again. Recently my brother was involved the Caribbean island Hurricanes where he goes to Med School, and his whole semester was shifted back to America until either this August or December. So now he's also in need of a car for about 8-9 months. I told my wife that since we are leasing a Nissan, we can let my brother borrow our current Toyota for the time being. My wife doesnt want to give up the Toyota to him in fear that she will lose it. I thought this was unjustified because she gave her Honda to her brother, so why can't I let my brother borrow the Toyota too? Both of us grew up believing in ""helping"" a person in need, and I feel like I went out of my way to let her brother have a car that was rightfully hers, but she didnt let me do the same when it came to my brother. But then again, I feel like she does have a right to the Toyota because it was a replacement for an engagement ring at the time. After her brother took the Honda, we have been using 1 car for the last year. I figured we could keep using 1 car for another 8-9 months if it means saving my parents some money in buying my brother a different car. Am I wrong here? Is she technically right? Am I unreasonable because what we do with the car should be my wife's decision, since it was a replacement for her ring? ",iki4life.txt

1,"Ending a 6 year friendship over her husband I [24F] am not sure how I feel about my friend’s behavior [28F] and I’m considering ending our friendship because of it. A little backstory, I’ve known her almost 7 years. We met through our boyfriends (they’re our exes now) and we used to do double dates and a lot of couple-y activities like roller skating or sleepovers and things like that. She and I stayed friends despite the break-ups with our boyfriends at the time. But our friendship has been a little rocky because of her busy schedule. She usually works 40-60 hours in any given week and she even lived in another city for 18 months so I didn’t always get to see her or hang out as much as I would have liked. But we’ve kept in touch through social media. I’ve always expressed a desire to hang out more, like doing road trips or daycations or local activities like concerts but she’s either too busy or financially strapped to do it. So typically we either see each other on our birthdays and that’s about it. The problem I’m having is that she’s married to this guy she met 4 years ago and I’ve been single for  5 years. I have a FWB [25M] who I’ve been in a “situationship” with for 18 months. I kept that a secret from her because it’s not a real relationship and I’m not sure if it’ll ever become one. She’s met him recently through a fluke of bumping into each other while he and I were out at a store. Ever since she became aware of his existence, she’s been pressuring me to plan “double dates” like going to the drive-ins to see the new Star Wars Movie or coming over to their house for Redbox movies and dinner. I already told her that’s not really the type of relationship that I have. I’ve mentioned the idea of all 4 of us hanging out to him casually to see if he’d be interested but he doesn’t want to do it.  When I told her that I rather she and I just go to the movies together or girls’ night over at my place, she said she can’t because she wants to spend time with her husband when she’s not busy working. I feel like she’s not really going to spend time with me unless I give in and do “couples” activities. I just feel like she and I are in such different places in our lives and have different values when it comes to friendship that it'd be better to end it now than to continue trying to spend time with someone who doesn't seem to want to do things just the two of us. Is it wrong of me not to want to be friends because of this? ",Breesasha.txt

Children in Beijing and the editorial staff at Al Jazeera can find out with the click of a mouse what I have to say about anything.  Everything!

If I spelled it ‘blog, would that give you a clue?

I’m keeping track of things in my log, which I publish on the web, hence this is my web log, or blog.    Of course, all blogs exist in the blogosphere.  “Blogosphere (alternate: blogsphere) is the collective term encompassing all weblogs. Weblogs are heavily interconnected; bloggers read other blogs, link to them, and reference them in their own writing. Because of this, the interconnected blogs have grown their own culture” (check it out at: en.wikipedia.org).

I'm a SAHM with a nearly 3 year old and 8 weeks off giving birth to my second. I'm also dealing with my husband being in a new job so it's a new routine for our boy. It's also a 40 minute bus ride into the city each time, maybe longer sometimes coz our weather is crap most of the time (take note). My friend knows this but constantly badgers me to come for coffee whenever HE has free time. He just started a new job as of yesterday. Before this he had free time 24/7. I told him in a huge message how my circumstances make it hard to just head into the city when he asks and that I can manage it on days I have midwife appointments. He replied that he had just as much responsibilities that he had to deal with but he managed to still come into town to visit everyone. It feels like he just ignored what I was saying and that meeting him was more important. Soooo frustrated!! What do I do? Am I a crap friend or does he need to understand where I'm coming from better? ",LoveMyAngelBoys.txt

0,Is it obvious when you have depression? I wonder if I have some form of mild depression or I just have low self esteem. I became a mute quite a few years ago after acouple of events that got me down. I think it may have been catatonia. But I'm not 100%. Ever since then I don't feel like I got back to my normal self. I'm a lot shyer and I don't have much luck socially or romantically or in my career. The best way to put it would be I lost my personality. I can really beat myself up sometimes because I hate myself. When something bad happens I really start self loathing quite badly. I don't feel suicidal. I hate myself more than I hate my life. I blame my lack of success on myself. I don't enjoy things as much as I used to so I have no real hobbies. I don't think I'm likable and I can't even pass interviews these days. I lost my personality and that's why I hate myself. I'm unrecognisable to who I used to be so I isolate myself a lot more these days. I don't think significantly depressed but I wonder if mild depression is the cause of my loss of personality? Or could it be something else that caused me to change?

1,"I cant figure out why some people only give out their opinions only to destroy someone else. What is wrong with people today? I'm sick and tired of hearing views and beliefs on politics, religion, and other stuff. I'm sick of seeing the way people behave when it comes to opposing views. Why can't we just...I don't know...Sit and enjoy the fresh air on a spring day? Sounds corny I know, but isn't that better than bashing a man for what he thinks is right or wrong. What did Jesus do? He ate with people that were wrong and people who reveled in their own beliefs.  He loved them, he didn't care! I'm so sick of us so called Christians seeking out only people who disagree with us only to prove that we are right! What worth is that? Will the glory of the coming Lord be enough for them and us? I guess not because all we care about is making sure that we are right and that they are wrong. Why can't we enjoy life, loving people, enjoying that we are different and loving them to Christ, not proving it to them. Life is so short. How can we make it count if we don't live by example and live with him? When I go out in the world I will try hard not to condemn people but love them, and in the meantime...Sit and enjoy the day, instead of sinking in my own so-called ""righteousness"". God did not create man to argue...But to love, and prosper with him. And...By the way...If you are going to talk with people who don't agree with you, remember this, ""the greatest single cause of atheism in the world today...Is Christians...Who acknowledge him with their lips and walk out the door and lead on with their lifestyle. That is what I'm believing the world simply finds unbelievable."" ",4110274.200408030.male.17.txt
1,"Is she toxic or am I reading too much into it...rant warning So to nutshell my relationship with her is that we met at our last job and hang out a lot. It's still a fairly new friendship but I'm noticing some things that are starting to get to me. I'm unemployed now and she has a awesome new job. So first thing I noticed was she didn't used to be the one to call me   but then when she needs a ride somewhere then she wants to chat and will try to segway the ride request in. If she made a habit out of calling any other time then I wouldn't stress it. It just makes me feel used when ""I just want to check on you"" turns to ""I need a ride"". Which brings me to the other issue. When she does call me it's the most disrespectful phone etiquette I have ever seen. After she knows she is going to get a ride she stays on the call(must be out of guilt or not wanting to make it seem like it's the only thing she wants.) but while she's on the phone she does not pay attention to me. Like she'll make active listening sounds that don't match up, like uh huh and a giggle when I just told her that I might need to give my cats up. Without telling me or warning or any sort of hint she'll just start talking to someone else around her like I'm not even on the other end. Worst yet almost always these calls are while she is at work and is just bored. On my end I'm distraction free and at the most filling out a job applications or pacing and I dunno I feel like if you are going to call your friend you should acknowledge they are on the other line and not just background noise while you browse the internet. Which brings me to her job. Her job to me is the most ideal job I could think of and I already know that but she brags about to the point that I'm getting really bitter. She keeps telling me about how many hours she's getting and during one of those phone calls even worked out how much she was expecting to make on her next check(unprompted). And she's so excited about 3 week paid vacation she is getting, and her health benefits and tuition reimbursement so she's going to take some classes on company dime. I mean I expressed how happy I was for her but she brings it up enough that I just wonder if she likes hurting me. Then there is her and her boyfriend. There is a whole thing about her and her psycho ex who even though made her feel afraid for her life, she still loves and talks to. WHILE WITH HER BOYFRIEND. I don't think she cheats on her boyfriend but I don't understand that whole deal that seems like an issue for another reddit thread all together. But yeh she does brag about how much sex she has with her boyfriend and how much they love each other. Which brings me to this next issue that I couldn't even wrap my head around. So I brought her home from work the other night and we were hanging out at my apartment. At some point she realizes that she forgot her keys back at work. This was after her work closed for the day. So I don't see the big deal I offer up ""well when your boyfriend picks you up then he can let you in."" But she doesn't seem to be hooking to that and is like ""I'm going to check the bus scheduled and just because I'm curious I'll check uber prices."" I'm really confused at this point. Essentially, her plan was to just go to her boyfriends work and hang out there till he finishes closing. Keep in mind we are neighbors, he doesn't have to go out of his way more than one street over and he has picked her up from my place before. Now he works about 30mins away so it would be a hell of a trek to drop her off there and make way back while it's dark and rainy and I don't know the area at all. At some point the brother of her boyfriend calls and says they can go hangout while she's locked out and she doesn't even ask me if I want to join or anything just leaves as if she had just been waiting at the busstop that whole time. She reassures me that she does like hanging out and I think we do have fun when she is hanging out. So I really don't want to cut her out of my life as I tend to do. It's just tonight seemed to be the worst. So she calls me up and tells me that her boyfriend is off of work so she won't need a ride and she thought that we could all hangout. Since we were going to meet up with some more friends. Welp, the other friends canceled and it was just us 3. We had some dinner and then her boyfriend suggested we go see a movie. I was already dressed and ready so why the hell not. I'm pretty sure she agreed(it's honestly hard to tell sometimes with her.) We got there and the movie me and her boyfriend were wanting to see was already playing. And she was being indecisive but eventually agreed to go. So me and him are hurrying to get to our seats while she just takes her time shuffling along. We already missed the first 15minutes. We had just had dinner but she wanted to stop at the concession and she just didn't seem interested at all about being there. So we watch the movie and about midway she leaves, I assume to go to the bathroom but shes gone for about 15minutes and I'm just sitting there thinking ""she wants us or one of us to go check on her"" but I wanted to watch the movie and I didn't feel like putting up with her drama. Afterwards she passive aggressively sits at her seat through the entire credits. Which didn't have mid credit or end credit footage. So I ask her whats wrong, and she's like I just felt a wave of depression and just wanted to go home and didn't know why I was even here or watching this movie and I felt forced into the whole thing. WHICH CAME OUT OF NOWHERE. If any one was forced it was me, she called me for that night out and I feel she is trying to make herself out to be a victim in it. I don't want to end this with her, because I like her and her friends which I only know through her so it would mean cutting all of them out. It's just I keep seeing how selfish she can be. I don't know if this friendship can be saved or worth saving. ",megles7187.txt

1,"Longtime close friend, brand-new bewilderment My friend is distractable. He thinks irrationally. And he barely listens anymore. I feel as though I've become a pane of glass or a mirror to him. When we're in a car together, he drones on about things (tell me if this has happened to you) he's told me many times before. Occasionally, in the middle, there's an admission: ""I probly told you this before, but.."". However, the story always continues, even if I briefly recap the story for him. When it's obvious the information has been shared, the most pressing imperative seems to be on reiterating it. Perhaps I didn't give the desired response the first time. I get the feeling he just doesn't care whether I'd like to hear it. I also possess conversational preferences, and they never include hearing the same story twice. After countless reccurences of this scenario, it seems that my considerations aren't really valued or remembered. Mentally, he seems to be on a train and passengers (myself included) are always bustling through and, as such, might just seem replaceable. There doesn't seem anymore to be a genuine interest in my take on things. Questions are rarely asked, and if they are, they're poised in such a way as to elicit some agreeable response. We've never had a problem with differing opinions, but lately there is a marked disinterest in mine. If I express perhaps a different perspective I might share on something, he's typically halfway through deconstructing it and preparing a rebuttal by the time I've reached the bulk of my first sentence. Lately, I make sure to be concise. 10-word sentences. Brief, clear declarations with stipulations kept to a minimum. I do this in a sincere effort to make sure at least some of my thoughts reach him via this channel called speech. I feel a little like a sidekick, implicitly expected to go along with whatever is said or suggested and quietly supporting. I have needs and I make sure they're met. I just make sure, now, that they're met completely before I go into a conversation or endeavor with him. The attention span has completely plummeted. He and his phone might as well have fused into one entity. Often times, when we're driving somewhere, or at our shared place of work, he will open a conversation. What he desires to be communicated is seemingly achieved. I give plenty of time, listening quietly and waiting a few seconds before responding. When I respond, sometimes I'll be surprised that I've been able to speak for a couple of sentences without being interrupted. Then, I'll look up and almost invariably, he's on his phone texting, on social media, or looking at boobs. I fall silent and look at him, stopping my speech, and sometimes there's a feigned response that hazily resembles some degree of mental assimilation. Other times, my input is simply ignored. I feel often that I am relegated to silence by virtue of necessity. What is the point of talking or even attempting to share with someone if they feel their device is more important than you? When there is no device involved, the listening is of such low quality that I feel as though I'm viewed as a shadow, or some reflective panel that occasionally flashes some piece of light which sparks a brief reaction. I use the word reaction explicitly to differentiate from response. Responding, to me, would be careful consideration of the texture of the exchange. What I see falls on a spectrum between bristling and hyperenthusiastic. Everything in the observable behavior appears to come from an emotionally fueled place. I long ago ceased trying to appeal to logic and reason, because there seems to be a fantasy aspect to his formulations about reality, business, and essentially learning in general. An obstinate and vigorous type of chauvinism appears when the discussion involves logically based and scientifically supported criterion as pillars of discussion. ""Have you ever thought that maybe our ideas about science are just implanted by society, and another race has fully influenced our evolution as human beings?"" (to imply that the scrutiny intrinsic to the scientific community's assimilation of data is too dismissive toward fringe and pseudoscientific contributions). ""Physics is just one way to understand reality; there are physics we aren't even aware of that we won't know about for hundreds of years"" (as a soft excuse or rationale to discredit or invalidate the advances in modern physics and thus not include them in discussion). ""Can you prove to me that 1 + 1 = 2?"" (in a maddening conversation I had with him whereupon he elected to discredit all mathematics by attempting to upend the premise that numbers can accurately represent ideas). I love math and physics because it helps accurately explain the world I live in. I can't share any of that enthusiasm with him, though, because his defenses rise as he falls lure to the siren of unreasonably ambiguous premises of belief. I get it; it represents flexibility and fluidity. There's no pinning someone down for their rationales or justifications if they honestly feel their ideas reside above the established and fair principles of unbiased scientific criticism. The implication seems to be that it's a lot more fun and even more reasonable to live in the dark, because anything a person makes up could be true, and the absence of scrutiny works synergistically to provide disincentives for the need for proof. We have been friends since third grade. We're both in our thirties now. We've remained close and shared lots of valuable experiences. Emotionally, we're there for each other and that's always what we've been best at. But I feel this insistence on the employment of a deductive philosophy of thinking which ignores outside criteria in favor of ""empathetic"" consult has wedged a chasm between us. I can't really tell if it's me or him whom has done the most changing in the last few years, but rest assured, I am working at a 100% level of effort to rectify what issues there are and reforge our understandings. A personal aside:  Three years ago, I experienced a rather significant mental shift. I began to make efforts to look at the world more objectively, understanding better how I was not the focal point of existence. I took myself down a few notches, and in doing so, became irrevocably drawn to learning about the finer workings of the world in which I lived.  During this time, I had the pleasure of working with a young man seven years my junior with whom I could seemingly achieve no middle ground. Even just a casual extended conversation seemed unbearable. We came from different places and really just resigned ourselves to tolerating one another. For a long while, I just couldn't put my finger on what bugged me about the guy. Then, about six months in, it hit me: I was unable to reasonably share anything I had learned, without it being scrutinized needlessly by way of the contrast of his own biased interpretations. The scrutiny itself didn't bother me; it was the nature of the uncredentialed and entitled rebuttals. They had little basis in scientific sourcing and did not stand stand up well to criticism. The young man's ideas about the world were essentially all based on his own experience, and there appeared to be no real desire in him to contrast those findings with a collective reality outside of his own.  I eventually came to realize I didn't like the kid because he reminded me of me. From that point on, I vowed to observe my thought processes more closely. The last thing I wanted was to waste someone's time unwittingly by spewing nonsensical garbage of which I had no demonstrable proof or understanding. I read about using proper reasoning and recognizing logical fallacies. I worked to become more mindful toward my own irrational inclinations. It became tantamount to recognize the ignorances and defenses to which I'd become accustomed to clinging, and replace them with the collective wisdom provided by my new best friends: logical and rational thought. As I was doing my best to employ these utilities, I figured I could scarce be assumed a fool and reasonably sort out those ideas which did not hold up to proper scrutiny. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this new method of articulating reality didn't win me many friends. The good ones I've retained, and those who didn't share this unearthed enthusiasm for inductive reasoning were left behind. This friendship I share with this person seems like a relic of the past me. I don't believe he's shared the same monumental changes in mental processing. He's always had a certain flair for exaggeration and fantasy, and until recently, I just accepted it as face value and dealt with the occasional misunderstandings as I'm sure he had with me. Now, however, the implications seem more pronounced. He's running a business and is constantly distracted. The time we share is often saturated by ramblings of fanatical pseudoscience or mysticism which are impossibly asserted and employ mind-numbingly irrational justifications. The only discipline seems to be that of a zealous allegiance to the fortification of the shared psychological concoctions of the hopefully ignorant. There is little point in rebuttal anymore because, deductively, the answer has already been solved for. And rest assured, 1 + 1 = 2 was not used in this equation. If indeed there is a future for this friendship, at least on my half, it involves intensely disciplined patience. I feel sometimes like a social worker, intently listening and softly steering the delinquent in a healthier direction. I meditate and identify as Buddhist. I consider myself to be a spiritual person, and I understand that my interpretation of reality is uniquely pixelated in ways that differ from those of others. I work to cultivate higher compassion and practice patience and kindness when I feel a bristling within myself or witness a bristling in others. As such, I feel that just living my values and being a good listener might be the way through this. I can't help but feeling, though, that this is the beginning of a fork in the road which leads to an increasingly fainter sense of collective recognition. ",Pleasuremann.txt

My dad is no angel either, he is arrogant and adamant, impatient and often has anger control problems, never felt close to him when a child and even now. Never felt any love towards my parent, I always had thoughts about running away from them.

Criticism is a big part of our family, you are not spared if you make even a minute mistake. Appreciation word is not in my family's dictionary. On top of that my family is conservative and my mom is very very conservative in the bad sense. She will criticize other girls and women for wearing slightly short or tight clothes, but if someone wears the same clothes in our family she will applaude it. My father too judges women based on the clothes they wear and how they look, he doesn't spare men either calling them names based on their physical features. I am tired with this outlook and want to leave the house as soon as possible.There is no room for opinion in my family, especially my father who does not want to listen to anybody else and has fought with me on several occasions. He does not spare me insulting in front of other people. I don't feel easy staying along with them and at the same time feel guilty for depending financially on them.

I used to live with four other girls who had diverse interests, and unfortunately we all kept to ourselves because of the different personalities. It was best that way. In your case, it seems like you're making as much effort as you can to be social. There's no need to go out on a limb to prove that you're not anti-social. When I had depression I really needed my space and the last thing I wanted to do was socialize with my roommates. Luckily, I am in my own apartment and have been living alone for three years now. It has helped enormously. I wonder if you can request a transfer to a bachelor suite where you can live by yourself. I did that in my 3rd year and the apartment manager put me on a waiting list, and I was able to get my own living space by November. Even though the moving was a hassle, I never regretted it. As for finding ways to spend time away from the noise of other people, I usually take the bus to visit a bookstore that is far away from campus. I go there every weekend to relax and read. It's away from campus life and it has helped me sort out my thoughts. The suggestions made by others such as the library, and a park are wonderful too. Maybe you can purchase a bus pass? I have depression and social anxiety, so it was difficult dealing with the university atmosphere on my own. I made only a couple of friends who have since moved on or graduated. I too saw a school counselor, but it was short-lived. What helped me, other than getting away from campus, was getting some online support from forums such as this one. I also kind of clung to one friend at a time, instead of many groups of people. I'd go to the movie theatre and watch something funny, or I'd take long walks. You're not alone. Hang in there and keep posting if you feel really down. I think this forum is very supportive and people will try to help you the best way they can. ",river_e_2_b_1_xx.txt

1,"Not invited to my friend's wedding. Is it time to abandon ship? A guy I have been close friends with for the last 13 years is getting married this year and I've come to the realisation that I'm not invited to the wedding. To be honest, we are not as close as we used to be. We used to hang out all time, but as lives became busy, we spent less time together. I still attend almost all of his social gatherings, though that is probably only 3 to 4 times a year. The weird thing is, I was invited to his engagement party. I got him and his partner a really meaningful gift that they still comment on whenever they see me, yet they didn't invite me the wedding. When I was slightly intoxicated at another friend's girls night some time ago, I asked the bride if invites had been sent out yet because I couldn't remember receiving mine. We then began the awkward exchange in which she told me it was really hard to narrow down the guest list and I realised I was never getting my invite. I tried to act as if I wasn't offended and that I understood, but honestly, I'm really hurt. I've been invited to the hen's night which is in a month. It is not a cheap night. Upwards of $200 for accommodation, games etc. It feels rude to expect me to pay so much to attend a hen's night when they wouldn't even pay for me to be a guest at their wedding. But I also realise that if I don't go to the hen's, it could come across that I don't value the friendship enough to go. What should I do? ",LadyPhoe.txt
0,"I'm a 24 year old female and I am extremely ugly. Despite having tried a slew of products recommended by dermatologists, and washing religiously, I nonetheless I have the most disgusting skin ever (EVER.  You know Freddy Kreuger?  He suddenly starts to look quite appealing next to me).  And I have ... unfortunate features.  I have a nose that would shame Pinocchio, small eyes, and a manly jaw.  This never used to bother me too much, because I've lived with being Unfortunate Looking my whole life, heard all the insults in school, and I figured that anyone who didn't want to know me because of my appearance wasn't worth my time. I try to make the best of what I've got - I'm not especially clever or talented in anything, but at least I dress nicely, get my hair done, wear makeup and all that, and I try to enjoy myself.  I knew I was unattractive, but I hoped that people enjoyed my company, and that one day I might even charm someone with my lovely personality enough that he might want to date me despite my appearance (it hasn't happened yet, but you've got to tell yourself SOMETHING, right?).  I have lots of friends, and even though I'm forever boyfriend -less, I'm the one that people seem to depend on for everything but sex, and that has always been a comfort to me. But yesterday, I overheard a friend - a friend! - saying that my skin is ""disgusting"" and I ought to ""do something"" about it.  He said that it was no wonder I was single.  He said it was a ""shame I wanted children so much, since no one would ever want to get close enough to impregnate me"".  The person he was talking to suggested IVF. I don't think I will ever be happy again.  I want to cut my face off.  I want to cut my face off and stick a grenade in my mouth. I don't want anyone to ever, ever look at me again.   I can't believe how utterly worthless I feel.  It's not just that they think I'm ugly - that's hurtful, but I knew I was hardly God's Gift to Men.  But that they would speak about me like that behind my back ... use THAT word in connection with ME?! ... I can't believe how much I've been kidding myself!!

0,"I have my ECT consultation today and I’ve never felt more alone. I have a good support system around me but somehow I’ve never felt more alone than at this moment. Nobody else that I know has had depression as severe as mine, or has ever been in this position where the choices are: be miserable forever, or zap your brain which might seemingly cause permanent memory damage and may not even work after all that. Last night was the first time I’ve felt really suicidal in a while (mostly I’ve just been miserable and haven’t even been motivated to plan my suicide). Why go through all these awful, invasive treatments when I could just end it quickly and quietly and then everyone else could get back to their lives? I feel like an immense burden. I’ve been severely depressed for the better part of 2 years at this point. It has totally disabled me, robbed me of a career I loved, and made most things difficult or unbearable. I’ve tried 7 different drugs to try and get it and my anxiety under control. No cigar. I don’t necessarily want to die, I just don’t want to live, if that makes sense. I feel as if my husband, friends, and doctor are keeping me artificially alive with all these treatments that don’t work, when in reality, I’m that painfully sick dog that needs to just be put down already. I never thought the potential for another treatment would actually make me more suicidal, but here we are. Thanks for reading. ",newwindowsofthesoul.txt

0,"Hi - I am ""dad"" a new member today (12/18/05) I like what I have seen so far and have a need to express myself and get some feedback from others. It is so hard to look at yourself..... especially when wearing the ""dark glasses"" of depression. I am a man in my late 40's - educated, with family- wife and two great, smart, loving kids, 15, and 13. I will try to summarize my story. About 5 yrs ago, I was laid off (tech field)...it was very hard to find another good position. We were so spoiled, I was making 70K - 100K in the past few years. We took it for granted. We built (4) new houses since 1989 - and did well. We enrolled our kids in a private Christian school (a high priority for us) THEN - My wife was in a auto accident and has spinal damage. She is ""mobile"", but has chronic pain. She is also suffering from depression. I managed to find another job, but it was a very dysfunctional place. I had to take a few leave-of absences - then I became ""pegged"" as a weak person. They eventually let me go for ""too many LOA's"" I'm paying $800 for COBRA - we can't do this forever....the pressure just adds to my anxiety. After seeing my psychiatrist, he took me through MANY medicines and even ECT's.... we tried for three years to find the most effective drug. Presently I take Zoloft, Cymbalta, Lamictal,Xanax & Valium for anxiety. I also have osteopenia (bone density loss), so I take, fosamax and Tylenol 4 (narcotic) for back/joint pain. Lastly, I use Soma for muscle strain. I don't know if the medicines are helping me or adding to the problem....? I admit I ""lean on"" some of the medicines as a coping mechanism. I have had so many situational events in the last few years, I suspect my depression is more environmentally caused...? I seem to ruminate on the ""bad events of the past"" too much. I am ""stuck"" - and just can't seem to get aggressive at my job hunt. We just sold our 6 bedroom house and are now living in a three bedroom apartment. I feel guilty that my family has to go through this. I know that I have skills and experience; but I don't have the self confidence - my ego is ""on the floor"". My sleep pattern is crazy and my appetite for food (and sex) is GONE. My wife is getting frustrated with me and doesn't always ""build me up""... Her depression has her down too.... With two depressed parents,it is very difficult to support each other. I feel ""stuck"" and don't know what to do....sometimes I just feel like giving up....

Cameron is a cautious girl, so she got up to check it out, just in case. She grabbed her pepper spray from the drawer of her bedside table and slowly walked towards the kitchen door. She pushed the door half way open, quietly, and stuck her head inside. She looked around the kitchen, but didn't see anything. Being annoyed by the whole ordeal, she dragged herself back to bed. She almost fell asleep again, untill she heard someone humming at the end of the hallway, with a woman's voice. Cameron is also a very down-to-earth girl, so she tried to find a reasonable explenation for it... it's like a reflex. ""Maybe someone is lost or something..."" she said to herself in a trembling voice. The humming sound kept getting louder and more intence, and the room got a bit cold. Her bedroom door was half open, and the only thing that lit up the room a bit was the moonlight, shining through the window. She kept staring at the hallway and breathing heavily, listening to the humming sound. She thought of asking who it is, but she wasn't that bold. Out of the darkness from the hallway, she could see two bright red eyes... she just sat up on her bed and had her eyes wide open. She didn't know what to do, so she panicked. She closed her eyes tight and tried to convince herself that it was just a dream. As soon as she opened them, she saw a shadowy figure standing at the foot of her bed, with the bright red eyes. It whispered something to her, but she couldn't understand it, mostly because she was terrified and extremely anxious. It reached over to Cameron's face, and she could see it's hand in the moonlight, it was as white as snow. Before she could do anything, her window opened and someone jumped inside! The figure with the red eyes turned, facing the other person. It started hissing, and it vanished in thin air. Cameron couldn't believe her eyes!      Who is that someone who saved her?

I'm 14, the middle child, and my brother who's 12 is the youngest. Our dad works abroad and comes back a few times a year. But we talk on phone almost everyday. My sister studies in a university and comes back usually on weekends and then maybe some other days depending on her schedule. When she comes back everyone in the house starts fighting and she's the problem. When she's home, everything we do is wrong. We were ""raised"" wrong. Mom ""spoils"" us. Mom doesn't ""love"" her. We ""don't want her here"". And when my mom says that she causes the problems she bursts into tears, goes to her room, cries for a bit and leaves to her boyfriends house because ""she feels loved there"". And that's how it always goes. She comes back, says that my brother doesn't do anything in this is house and that he's a spoiled brat, fights over something, bursts into tears and leaves. She is very emotional. When she accuses my brother of something and he calls her some kind of name she immediately stars crying like it's the end of the world. Last night she texted my mom, saying that she raised us poorly and that mom doesn't love her. She said that she's gonna be leaving our home and won't come back because ""we don't want her there"". Of course, me, as  the peace maker in the family, wrote her a huge message about how she is wrong, how we actually love her is just that she doesn't see it and everything else.

0,I can't make it better I'm tired of nearly every aspect of my life. Changing it for the better would require money.  To get money you have to work.  Work is boring and tedious and makes me miserable. That goes for any job I could realistically obtain. I can't do more than part time.  I'll never have the kind of money it would take to change my life in ways that might make me happier. There is no point to life so why suffer through the misery and hardship? I want to die but I can't kill myself. I'll never have the nerve.  I feel stuck. ,Ohboy89.txt
0,"Dear reddit, happiness isn't a choice for everyone I'm sorry but I need to get this off my chest in a place where people will understand me. Dear people that think happiness is a choice, it's not. Me or my fellow sufferers don't choose to be miserable. In fact if it really was that simple, I'm sure 99% of us would choose to be happy without even having to think. I feel sad because I have mental illness. If you don't know, that means my brain isn't normal. My brain has deficiencies and such that keep me from feeling happy, even when I should. I'm so sick of reading replies to mine and other people's post about depression that try to oversimplify a serious mental illness that can cause suicide. I swear everyone on this website assumes we do nothing to try to help ourselves. I really can't believe people are that misinformed that they really think that many people choose to be that miserable. You wouldn't choose to be miserable if you had the choice, and so would we. But we don't get that choice. Then we have comments like ""Just put a life together that wont make you depressed"". I think these piss me off the most. If it was really that simple you think I would of done that by now? Also a lot of people don't mention how hard changing your life can be if you don't have money or resources. TLDR: Stop oversimplifying a serious illness ",jj1956.txt
0,"Constant battle between ambition and not wanting to live. Since I was about 12 I've had recurring suicidal thoughts. The thing is, I don't have low self esteem or anything of that sort, it's actually quite the opposite and I always joke about being a narcissist. I may not be an actual narcissist, but I've always had a slight superiority complex.  I don't hate myself, but I just hate my life and the continuous chore known as living. On the outside, I've always been the life of the party, but deep down I don't ever remember being happy. As someone who's highly ambitious, it feels as if there's a never ending struggle between wanting to be successful enough to be well known or have an impact on the world, and wanting to stop existing. Yet with the prospect of the latter, comes the failure of the former. I know that if I lowered my expectations in life I would be mildly happier, yet the thought of settling for mediocrity gives me horrible anxiety and fills me with dread. Recently things have gotten worse due to my university workload. I've been having trouble completing assignment and functioning in general. I've considered getting help but I feel deeply uncomfortable at the thought of opening up to someone, since I'm not a very emotional person. I've come to accept that I will probably never be happy. I've always wondered if I would be more likely to actually commit suicide if I ever attained the level of success I desire since I would have then achieved my goal in life, or if that would finally bring me the contentment I seek. I suppose it would be the former since I can never be content. ",accualiizdolan.txt

0,"The last 3 days felt like the first days of my life. Today feels like the beginning of the last days. I have been having depression since Senior Year. I have been fighting non stop for 5 years. I took gap years to fight depression. Until last October, I thought depression has gone cause i felt totally normal at that time. During the time, I had a lot of ups and downs. Lots of tears, lots of laugh. But i have never given up on myself Last November, my brother did sth bad. And my ex attempted suicide. That is when i got depressed again. The first time in 2 years Until 3 days ago, I met a girl. ""Perfect stranger"" is the word that would suit her the most. My situation with her is exactly like in the movie ""Before we go"" by Chris Evan. 2 strangers meet each other out of 7 billion people but they would never see each other again. And 3 days after we met ( we hung out everyday for the last 3 days), she is gone. We still keep contact but I dont think i would ever see her again ( please dont ask why). She knows about depression. She made me make a promise to reach out to her every time i get depressed. The last 3 days were the happiest days of my life. It feels like I actually live for the first time. But i also got depressed since. I got depressed because i couldn't recall her image. I couldnt recall her face. I couldn't recall what she looked like when we first met. And i couldnt remember why those were the happiest days of my life. I just recall those were the happiest. All i can recall is a brief moment of her smile for like 5-10 secs, her voice, and the moment when we were about to say good bye that i poured out my heart. Everything is so blurry. Then i went on to google to search for blurry memories and depression. And it leads me to ""depression and memory loss"" and "" depression and Alzheimer "" . Then i started to shed tears. I was thinking about the day i actually lost my memories. What if it actually comes, What if one day i wouldnt remember her, my mom, my best friends, and even myself ? I was teaching in class when i shed tears. I had to run to the bathroom and cried in there for 15 mins. Luckily noone noticed. I remembered my promise to her. I was about to text her. And then i started to cry again. I will bother her. I will make her worried. I will waste her time. And i cant afford to hurt people i love. This is the beginning of the end. Please help.

0,"I tried to get onto the chat room, but it won't let me so I'll just post my question here. In my sociology class today my professor was talking about an experiment where several pseudomanic (healthy) patients checked into mental hospitals to record the results. The details of the experiment aren't important, but what I was wondering was about how my teacher said that the patients used fake names so that it would not be on their permanent record and so that they wouldn't be labeled as ""crazy"". So I raised my hand and asked who would be labeling them and why they couldn't use their real names, like how would people know? He said that it would be on their record and that if people wanted to find out if they have ever been hospitalized they could, particularly employers. Kind of like if you wanted to inquire about a rapist living in your town, is what he said. I wanted to ask more but didn't want to press it. So my questions are, what kind of record does this go on? Your hospital record? Your police record? When employers do a background check, does this show up? Then I was wondering, when police pull you over for speeding or something and they check your information on their computer, what comes up? Everything? If they were involved in an ambulance taking someone into the hospital, do they have that on file? Is there any way to see what's on your file? I'm just a little paranoid now about if there are going to be limitations in life now as to what I can do because of my record. Or if anyone knows how I would be able to find out this information that would be great, ",funk77_e_2_a_c3q_us.txt

My parents tried their best but were at a loss. Finally, I met A [18 M] last september and we started dating in July.

1,"Mom treats me like a stray cat and siblings like gold My younger brother and sister are 10/11 years younger than I am. We have an older brother but he no longer speaks to our mother and has t for about 5 years. I’m an adult now and I fully support myself and have since I was 18. As soon as I graduated high school and child support stopped, I was tossed out of my moms with nothing but garbage bags filled with my clothes. I was told I had to live with father even tho my mother had just bought a house with her husband and my youngest siblings. My stepfather never like me and always kept me separate from their family. They would go to dinner every Friday night and I had to stay home bc he would flip out and many other mean things. To my step dad, I was a stray cat who didn’t belong near his children. My mother never stuck up for me and stayed with him until I was in my mid 20s when he cheated on her and left her. I was raised dysfunctional but bc of that I long for a close, supportive family. Once he was out of the picture, I was able to create relationships with my sister and brother. My siblings are now in their late teens and I’m 26. I’ve struggled immensely on my own I had no choice. I could have 3 dollars to my name and my mother wiuld take it from me for coffee etc. if she picked anything up for me I had to give her the money ASAP. Soon as child support stopped, legit the day I graduated i had to live with my dad and mother gave me only garbage bags with clothes.  good. Anything that had been mine was now my sisters (bedroom set, jewelry stand, American girl dolls list goes on. Now years later, my mother makes sure my brother and sister have everything and anything the very best of. Designer everything, newest clothes shoes, technology. When it comes to me, my mother doesn’t do anything at all. If she buys the coffee I am to give her to $2 but reversed she would die if I asked for the money back for he coffee. Now foremost, I’m fully aware I am an adult and can support myself. It has nothing to do with what my mother does for siblings it’s how she treats me compared to her treatment of siblings. For instance, I asked to use sisters perfumes that smelled good and was told no it’s her expensive kind. I’m not to use anything of my brother or sisters actually. My brother s d sister themselves do not care about this stuff it’s just my mom. When cleaning my face, my younger brother is allowed to use my sisters face cream or anything really bc well they are siblings. But i am not allowed to use the very same thing. If my mother is getting rid of things she will charge me full price. If she orders pizza and I eat a couple pieces I have to pay her half the money. Point I’m getting at is that she treats me like im not good enough to use my sister expensive designer perfume or face wash etc. she can buy the best of the best for them but charges me if I need anything. Holidays she spends thousands on them and if she does anything for me she only gives me gift she receives for free for spending so much as PINK etc .im not expecting to be equal. Again I’m an adult and can buy myself things but she can’t spend even $25 on a gas card or something lol I should add that it is expected of me to get her and siblings expensive gifts for their bdays and Xmas. Moms bday is in January if I happen to be broke and can only afford a $25 dunkin card, my bday in February she will get me something small or a $5 dunkin card. If I can’t afford a gift, she makes damn sure my bday co es and goes without her buying bday gift. Immature or not I’m very hurt by this. I was always a good kid, never in trouble, finished high school, went to some college and never asked for hand outs. Why am I not worth two small sprays of designer perfume?? ",meghanfalls.txt

0,"I am 20 year old female. I have been on numerous antidepressant and anxiety medicine since I was 11 years old. I never had a problem with sexual dysfunction because 1) I had never been in a serious relationship, 2) I had never been sexual with someone. Now that I am in a sexual, serious relationship, I am having problems. I believe this is a result of Lexapro. I have never had a problem orgasming (at least not to this extent) and I have been on Zoloft, Prozac, you name it, etc. (These medicines were changed because they were either making me too drowsy or simply weren't working). During the summer, I was only on Wellbutrin and had no problem orgasming. However, due to overwhelming anxiety during the start of the school year, I started taking Lexparo and continued the Wellbutrin. Ever since I added Lexapro, I have had an EXTREMELY delayed orgasm, or no orgasm at all. It is really frustrating.  My doctor suggested switching medicine, but since Lexapro is working so well for me as far as anxiety goes, I said I'd rather not. I can't lower my dose because I am on the starting dose for both Wellbutrin and Lexapro. He said I could switch to Effexor or another SSRI medicine, but I may have the same sexual dysfunction.

0,"Feel like I have no right to feel this way People have it worse than me, while I, a privileged man with a loving family, cannot feel most of the time. I hate using the term “depressed”. Even as I’m writing this, I feel like I want to delete it. It’s being thrown around so much lately that I feel like I’m just being a little bitch that uses it like I don’t know it. Have been seeing therapists for months, talking to them and trying to find a way on how to see life differently. Thankfully I’m not prescribed any of those fucking pills, because my current therapist is smart enough to know they aren’t the best medicine for me. Whenever I feel joy, it lasts for a minute, then I’m back in my own dark world. Very dark world. I think about suicide, screaming at people, wanting to beat some people up.

0,"Is it possible to fake depression? I have been feeling bad for about 7 months now. There are periods where I cry on a daily basis, I never feel like talking, I struggle concentrating and collecting thoughts, I feel such an extreme sadness inside of me also in happy situations, I am exhausted all the time even if I sleep 10 hours straight, I often have headaches, I am completely alone and I find it difficult to do anything. There are nights where it’s unbearable. I think about my situation: I am completely alone, I am failing at anything because I am so weak I can’t handle my feelings, I feel guilt for everything that happens around me, I can’t carry on anymore, I am always here in this dark place and I feel that I have no right to be like this. I used to self harm and I still have many scars on my skin, but I think to be disrespectful to those who truly struggle then I promised to cut never again. I shouldn’t have the right to do so. My life is void, I am void, and I can’t get the energy to do anything ever. I do not get pleasure from what I used to love, nothing seems to make me feel something good. I can enjoy no series, no book, no videogame like I used to. I think I don’t even deserve to eat. I am just trying to pity myself giving myself depression, but I don’t have it.

0,"I've never talked about this to anyone I've struggled with depression since I was in 2nd grade. For the last 7 years it's gotten worst, I'm 20 at the moment. When I was 13 I was raped occasionally. Being raped when it first happen didn't bother me as much because I didnt understand what was happening until years later. What did bother me at the time was that I felt alone. I've always felt alone, never felt like anyone cared for me or about me. I fought with my mom and step dad a lot which made me feel even more lonely. I never talked about feeling lonely to anyone because I was always embarrassed about it and still do. Because me and my parents had a rocky relationship I would be abused by both at times. One time I was arguing with my mom and she ended up getting a 2 by 4 and started hitting me with it. I never rasied my hands at my parents, just talked a lot of shit and was an asshole to them. My parents kicked me out of their house when I was 14. I ended up living with my grandpa. This made me feel unwanted and even more lonely now that my parents gave up on me. I lived with my grandpa for about 9 months before he sent me back to my parents because he couldn't ""afford"" to keep me. I wasn't an asshole to my grandpa nor was I mean to him, I just was a teen who stayed up late and took long showers. My grandpa giving up on me was heartbreaking for me. I felt like no one wanted me and if I ended everything then everything would be better. I didn't even last a week at my parents house, they shipped me off to live with some family who lived in the rural country area instead of the city. I lived there for maybe 4 months and finished my freshmen year of high school there. I didn't feel welcomed anywhere I went and for the most part I felt more beyond alone. Majority of the time at my uncle's I was in my room, alone and desperate for a friend. After 4 lonely months of really being alone I was given back to my parents again. After coming home broken I learned to keep to myself. No one wanted me and no one cared. When I got back home I was sent to an all boy high school. Once again I had to go to a new school and try to fit in somehow. I was lonely for a while until I met this girl. I'm afraid to write her name incase she ever reads this and it hurts reading/writing it but I need to get this off my chest. I met this beautiful girl named Cindy at a school function. She went to the all girl school down a couple streets. Both all gender schools would make events for each other to get students that social interaction. Anyways I meet this beautiful girl named Cindy, she was nice to me and I was nice to her. We dated for over a year and while it lasted it was nice. The way she broke up with me literally broke me. I was having a really sad day and told her about how I struggle with really bad depression and that I have suicidal thoughts. Her response was ""oh"" and she slowly stopped talking to me. Eventually she stopped talking to me and when she did talk to me she made excuses about not having time to talk to me. She was my only friend, the only person I was close to. She couldn't be there for me when I needed her most, when I needed a friend most. So I stayed alone thinking maybe school was too much for her at the moment. Then one day I get on Facebook only to see her on it, I clicked on her page and saw that she had been on hanging out with friends and having the time of her life. She slowly broke me, I couldn't handle it and called her to confront her about it. She made excuses and talked about how she didnt have time for me at the moment, so she hung up and left it alone. I was reaching my breaking point, I was going to commit suicide. I sent her a text message talking about how I needed her to talk to me and be a friend because I was getting worst. She never responded to me however she did get in contact with my school to let them know what I was dealing with. I was so embarrassed that she did this to me, I felt betrayed and hurt that she made me the schools problem instead of hers. It hurt ne so bad. I was embarrassed that the school knew, I was embarrassed that my parents knew now. I wanted to kill myself more than ever now. I was so hurt by this and was angry at Cindy. I went home and tried stabbing myself. My mom went in my room to talk to me, just so happened at that moment I had a kitchen knife in my hand to stab myself. My mon fought me over it and sent me to a psychiatric hospital. I stayed there until December 23rd. At the hospital I tried killing myself twice. First time was when the guards/residents give you cracks, I ate the crackers but stuffed the wrapper down my throat. One if the residents heard me making choking nosies and came in to save me. Second time was when I started swallowing my food instead of chewing on it to choke me out again. They put me on these medications that didn't help but I acted like they did so I can go home. I was alone again, Cindy stopped talking to me. It broke my heart and broke me. It's been 4 years since Cindy and I'm not over it. It still kills me about what happened. I'm still depressed and suicidal. I honestly wish I did kill myself when I had the courage to do so. There hasn't been much for me other than pain. I haven't moved on and I haven't gotten over everything. This was my deepest darkest moment in my life so far. I wish I could say things got better for me since all of that but true is they haven't. I'm still the same lonely person I've always felt I've been for the longest time. I've tried dating in college and I've never had feelings for anyone. Don't have many friends and don't have any real reasons to be here still. I'm just waiting on that one thing to break me down to give me courage. If you read this thank you. Im sorry I made you read a lot and I'm sorry that I'm this way. I'll get better one day but not soon. ",podcastaddict24.txt
0,"A song of fire and ice Hey everyone. I'm on mobile so pardon my typos which will happen. I'd like to take this time to thank anyone who reads this as well as giving a shout out to anyone currently struggling with depression. I have a long history with Type 1 Bipolar Disorder. Although that isn't necessarily depression in itself patients who are Bipolar are bound to eventually oscillate into that emotional polarity. To give a quick summary here is what happened to me: I grew up incredibly wealthy. My Father was an ex alcoholic. My Mother died when I was 13 and my Father went back to drinking to cope with the loss of his wife (my Mother). My Father became suicidal and threw everything we had away. We went bankrupt and I went to live with my Brother across the country. My Brothers wife left him shortly after I moved in. He became suicidal as well, ended up hospitalized. I moved back across the country again to live with my then pseudo homeless Father. One day my Father shows up to my school drunk, gets arrested, I am taken in by the state and put into foster care. I end up living with an incredibly poor hispanic family and eat almost nothing everyday. I have no bed. I sleep on the floor. The state then places me in an incredibly religious home where i essentially become a slave and i cook and clean nonstop for an extremely wealthy catholic couple. They don't like me Because I liked hard rock. My third stay I end up living in a small apartment with a woman who was good at hiding her side prostitution gig and methamphetamine addiction. After all the years my Father gets his life back under control. He begins dating a wealthy woman who isn't a fan of me. He takes prolonged stays at her home about 40 miles away. He would visit the house to restock it with food, pay the bills, then leave again. During this time i saw my Father maybe 15 times a year. Each encounter was brief and lasted less than 30 minutes. During this I still went to school, cooked, did my laundry, and did kind of normal kid stuff. The point of this story is I am an adult now who is married. I am a software engineer. I am financially stable. Regardless of how dark it gets it is possible to make it out on top. You have to focus and be strong. Do whatever you need to do to survive. If anyone has any questions or would like to chat, need advice, whatever please let me know. I currently do volunteer work to aid people who suffer from Bipolar Disorder as well as others like ADHD or OCD. I also, accidentally, mentor Fatherless children on Xbox Live (strange, I know). Its not easy out there and world and parents sometimes forget how hard it is being a teen. No judgement. I hope everyone has a good night (or day, depending where you're at). ",TryingMyBestOK.txt

But it's getting worse and worse, I'm back home now, and start to realize, that I have nowhere to run and I'm getting old for that. I had a best friend in London, but she just used me and left when my ex went to jail. I have no one to talk to and I found so difficult to find new friends. I never talk about my problems, just to myself, when I'm with people, I'm completely different person, I'm so shy and I hate it. I hate it when I want to say something, but my mind doesn't let me and I'm just upset on myself. I don't remember the morning, when I woke up with a good mood or without headache. I've been thinking so much, that even when I stop I still feel this horrible pain in my head. I tried to bring my confidence up with drugs, but they just made it worse and I feel even more depressed. I've been thinking everyday. What am I going to do? and what is the worse about all this is that when I decide something what I feel is right and in few hours or minutes I think about it again and my feelings change and change again. ...it's driving me crazy. I'm getting so sensitive on everything, I'm crying from watching a stupid cartoon, or listening to the music, I feel sick or strange high on everything I put in my mouth. I think I've lost myself, I can't see the point of life anymore. Suicide? I tried that, but now I'm afraid of death, I'm afraid of everything.

Yes it might be selfish of me as I am the only one who wants the friendship to be like before.. all of my attempts have failed so far.. but its next to impossible to not think of her as she was my routine for past 6 years.. and I too tried the regular methods suggested everywhere like cutting contact, getting busy, etc but at the end of the day you always have some time for yourself and in that time her thoughts always come to my mind...

1,"In the year 2002, was my greatest regret ever. The only peson invoved and to be blamed is me. It was my fault that I did not I did not do well in my P.S.L.E. I was studying in Coral Primary school. There is where my problems started.      Firstly, I mixed around in the wrong group. I was new in Coral Primary as I had just transfered from Loyang Primary in the second month of 2000. In the beginning I thought it would be ""ok"", and the things I did were fun and I enjoyed it very much. I skipped the remedials I had every day to meet my friends in the car park. There I would spend hours to play with fire but I did not smoke. I did not pick up any bad habbits as I already knew they were to harm me. And when I went home I would tell my mum that i went for my remedials. I thought I would concentrate in my work as well as well as go out with my friends. But this did not happen. Instead I started avoiding studies. Soon, I started getting involved in more trouble and later on I started thinking that my friends were more important than my studies. When the time came, that was two years later in the year 2002, I wasen't ready. It was my P.S.L.E. It was now that I realised that my mistakes.        During my exams I went blank in my weakest subject, maths. The rest of the subjects were average. I started to panic as I knew I was going to get bad marks. In the end I did. I did very badly and got into a school I did not wnted, Siglap Secondary. At first I thought that I would do anything to get out, but as time passed, I became to know the school beter and realised it was a good place to learn in. But every where there will be ""this"" and ""thats"". There is no scholl that is perfect. Well, I was confused in what to do, I was lost but I knew that I had to adapt to it and strive to do my best. I was angry and dissapointed at myself on my mistake but I knew I had to let the past be the past. But not forget the past but learn from the mistakes. I learnt my mistakes and I know that I should not do it again. Now I have stuck this in my head that I should not mix around in the wrong company as the consequences would be unbearable and that I should pay attension in my studies. Now that I know the ""good"" and the ""bad"" and now I believe I can achieve my goal. ",4007265.200408020.male.13.txt

I love my husband we have been together for 16 years and have 2 children together. He went to Thailand with his dad last year to visit his brother who lives over there working as a teacher, but before he left he found this website forum owned by a bar owner there who uses bar girl prostitutes as waitresses. To make this long story short he went with one of these bar girls while he was there and it took my children to find out the truth because I was too stupid to find out myself lol One found pictures of her in his organizer and the other found text messages on his cell phone. I should have known something was up as he never leaves his cell phone on anymore when at home anymore since he came back. He sits on that forum when at work and also at home all the men on that forum talk about the bargirls and post pictures of them also. My daughter sent a text message to the woman and she said a lot of hurtful things to her, I was worried for a few days that my husband would find out she was contacted and blame me. We also found pills he has been taking that he got from India called tadalasil which is a form of viagra, as far as I know he never had a problem sexually so why is he taking these pills? who knows lol My cousin called me a couple of days ago and said he posted a message on that forum saying he wants to go back to thailand again and what excuse could he give me for wanting to go, she said he also said that he posted he doesn't want to cheat on me just fuck other women when I'm not around. She checks the forum for me as I don't want to see it but it hurts just as bad when someone tells you what he puts. He doesn't have any friends really here where we are because all he does is works so I don't know if the men on the forum are substitutes for real friends and he is putting what they would find interesting or what. I don't drive and we live out in a rural area with no real neighbors so I don't get into town barely and I don't have many real friends here as we moved here to do some job work. So that saying LIFE SUCKS really seems to fit lately lol My concern lately is sex transferred diseases such as AIDS as I found out that thailand is known as a sex trade country and many have the disease. Prostitution is illegal there but they allow businesses to operate like that bar due to the money the male tourists bring there. The government is going to give asia and africa millions of dollars to help research AIDS but they are not going to make Thailand help stop the spread of the disease by shutting down places that promote prostitution, they worry about bird flu or about people carrying weapons onto planes but they don't care if men bring a silent killer like AIDS back into our country and infect their spouses or lovers. Do I sound crazy? because sometimes I feel I am going crazy lol I'm sorry for rambling on but I have held this in for months, scared to talk to him as i love him with all my heart even if others say I'm an idiot and scared to talk family and friends anymore about it because it hurts to much.

1,"Are friendship ultimatums a good or bad thing? I have this friend who've I've been friends with for about 7 years. She moved across the country and is depressed for not knowing anyone she can be friends with. She's been making me feel bad about not going there to visit her. I've told her several times, I'm broke and have school obligations. Every time we talk, she brings up how she misses me and just needs a hug, and have someone (me) brush her hair, and hang out  with her. Recently, I've found out that she feels there's an inequity in our friendship over the past year; because I haven't gone to visit her. I personally feel I've been there for her and her child whenever she needed me and dropped everything and go see her whenever her and her ex-husband and ex-best friend would have a fight. About two months ago, my S.O. made a bad joke and she ended up lashing out on him and making a comment about a subject that I told her in confidence, and ended up hurting me as a result. We talked about it, and tried to go back to normal. But, I realized, that I'm still hurt by her comment and told her that. She then says she's going through a lot right now and can't deal with me going back and forth on my feelings. So she said I need to ""figure my shit out"" and let her know if we can move past this or end our friendship. I've been doing some thinking and I'm torn on whether or not to try to get over this feeling of betrayal, or just completely end the friendship all together. TLDR; My friend gave me an ultimatum to decide if I still want to be friends with her or not. ",friendshipbootcamp.txt
1,"Today I write on were I live, but I think I shall start with were I am from. I give you this information so that when you read my future commentaries, you will understand why I think the things I do.     I grew up in the metropolitan city of Tulsa, Oklahoma, born in 1979 and lived there until I was 18 years old. My school career consisted of living and learning with the same group of kids from Elementary~High School (give or take a few). I made many friends and lived within a social standard that rated second to none. I had everything I wanted, popularity and a social stance that should make Barbie jealous. There I was happy. After graduation I decided to move to Atlanta, Georgia (good old Hotlanta). There I lived for 2 years among my father's side of the family within a few miles of where I stayed. Atlanta was beautiful and had a lot to offer to someone seeking a professional business career, but it had it's down side too. I soon found that the night life was too enticing to ignore, and I knew I would break myself long before any good could come of the situation. With that, I moved to Michigan. As a child I would come up every summer to a small lake located between a small city and an even smaller township. I had always thought (then) that I would move to the lake and have a life of lake living and contentment upon knowing people with a higher stature and career driven lifestyles.           Now, after all that back ground I can finally tell you my stories of what I would like to call, ""As the village turns."" ",4116243.200408040.female.24.txt

1,IDK WHAT TO DO ANYMORE AH IM IN SUCH A DILEMMA. Basically I have this friend whom I’ve known for 10+ years and we’ve always been quite different but were good friends nonetheless. Over the past 3 years this friends true colours have been slowly creeping out and its been really affecting me! Most recently she did some that was way out of line and really made me question who she is! I’ve tried cutting her out slowly and distancing myself but I can’t really escape it since our university campuses are the same and she’s recently joined a club I’m in! She’s basically just so fake around me and is so nice to everyone else and I ignore it and let it slide but the thing she did that was way out of line is something I can’t get over? She also always makes me feel guilty for what I have and always makes me out to be just ‘lucky’ but nothing I have ‘have’ is due to luck! It’s literally pure hard work??? And now that she’s joining this club it’s gonna make things 1000x worse because she’s just going to show off to all the guys and be this super fake ass person? She thinks she can get away with it and basically try walk all over me just because she’s known me for ages cause otherwise she literally follows everyone else like a sheep? I’ve tried confronting her about her actions but she just laughs it off??? How can I just get over it all ready?? It’s really beginning to affect my mental health 😭 like I didn’t really speak either her over the last 2 months and I’ve never been happier but seeing her around college more literally makes my blood boil she’s honestly just so toxic and I feel like hanging with her in this club is going to ruin my reputation and what others think of me!

0,"Hi folks, I've only discovered this topic after making several previous posts :) I am from a traditional Asian culture, but now half-westernized on migration to Australia since age 6. I've had a long history that stems right to my parents' histories before I was born. To cut it very short, my father has schizoid/schizotypal/socially withdrawn personality traits, and my mother has dependent traits, so they basically had a loveless marriage (common in my culture). There is a long history of parental quarrelling and physical abuse on my mother before and after I was born, some of which I heard as a child to early teens. I was seldom exposed socially growing up, and I had few school friends. I was also 'born' a quiet person, but this and lack of socializing made me a withdrawn kid. When I was about 4, I believe I experienced one psychotic episode (I 'saw' 2 caped 'grim reapers' at that time), since which I have no further experiences. I experienced a few bouts of depression during secondary school, for which I didn't seek help because of my shyness and parental/cultural stigma that 'depression does not exist' (thankfully my family has ditched that attitude now). During that time, I had many suicidal thoughts and attempted suicide maybe 3 times but didn't tell anyone about it. A very terrible incident also happened towards the end of high school - one night, I physically assaulted my father while he was quarrelling with mom, and he was hospitalized. I got charged with assault, but no conviction was recorded after I did psychotherapy for anger control - that was also the only therapeutic contact with psychological/psychiatric services I had until very recently. That incident, although I felt numb through that time, has been scarred into my memory - I can still recall the events, and my conscience is still wrecked over it, though I continue to fight it and let it go. At school, I was a top-end academic achiever in science and math. I was named dux of the school on graduation. Upon entering university, my depression became worse mainly because of increased social isolation. I was still shy and withdrawn, I lost contact with my high school friends (they also saw me as 'weird', but I was also a bit narcissistic towards them at some times - I think it was an unconscious aggressive reaction towards them), and failed to make any lasting friendship with university peers. One year into university, I started studying Medicine, which I am still doing at the moment. However I felt that course had over time did not improve me, though I did make few friends. I still felt unable to socialize with peers, even though I was in constant contact with them through many lectures and tutorials. Even though I was an average performer, I felt I struggled heavily through the years with study. Late last year, my depression hit a new low - my parents had another quarrel, and I was studying psychiatry which forced me to realize the extensiveness of my past and current problems. It was another awful time - I lost a lot of self-confidence/esteem, became more withdrawn. I ended up failing my first practical exam but still passed given my past satisfactory academic record - the faculty put it down to lack of practice, but the truth is because of what I experienced leading up to the exam. In this year however my depressive bouts became much worse - my few friends had deferred, and I was left with no friends, despite still knowing the others 'by name'. My experience during this year was largely negative - I felt harassed by teaching doctors, peers, being looked at as a 'weirdo' and excluded from conversations and their social outings (whether this was a valid view, I'm finding out now by resocializing with them - my main aim at the moment). Over the last 2 months I had about 5 more depressive episodes, and attempted suicide 3 times, again nobody knew about them. It became a frantic situation - I approached the faculty dean for help, but he only recommended me a psychiatrist, who he was supposed to contact before I contacted him. However that psychiatrist wasn't notified, and I felt very angry about it and thought that nobody was out there to help me. In retrospect, my view was unrealistic - help only exists on a professional level, something I knew long before but did not acknowledge at that time, making me upset. My depression faded away a few days later. A few nights ago, I had a short dispute with mom, got upset and this eventually led to me joining this forum after a quick search on the net. Why am I writing this intro? Several reasons. I want to tell my story to others, and feel this is a stepping stone to encourage myself. I also want others not yet aware that depression can affect ANYONE, even the best of us, even those involved in the medical profession (up to 30% of junior doctors suffer from depression, and up to 10% have attempted/committed suicide). I want to improve my own situation - most of all, learning to deal with feelings of sadness and negatively that has crippled me mentally in the past, and my lack of sociability which doesn't help my situation. I know deep inside I am capable of pulling through, of being able to live a normal healthy life because I am aware of my problems and have the power to deal with them. Finally, although I'm still a student, I believe my position is privileged and that I should use what knowledge I have learnt to help others as best as I can, something I will be bound to by Hippocratic Oath on finishing school. I am grateful that such a forum exists for others and me to express our thoughts, experiences and feelings, and that there are people out there who devote themselves for such causes. Thank you all.

Since then I've chosen to put them in the back of my mind. My gf had asked me if I would ever look them up or would want to meet them, I just blahhed the question. So this past Sunday morning I typed in my last name on Facebook &amp; started snooping around. Voila, there was my half brother, voila, there was my half sister. No lie, I was extremely happy, &amp; extremely sad. My father had, has, is unfaithful to my mother. Because of that reason I had no interest in meeting my half family.

0,"As you live life and learn new things you grow more mature. Life is not about growing up and making plans for tomorrow, it's about enjoying every moment as you're living. Happiness is the most important thing and people have forgotten that. The world is full of so many interesting things that all cost money and we believe having a lot of something is the key to happiness. And since money is the thing that buys us the things we want we sort of become obsessed with getting as much of it as we can. In my mom and my situation we've tasted what money can buy us and we don't want to go back to the way things used to be. But the thing is we were both happy then and now we're not. I've learned money cannot buy happiness. My dad and Julie don't have much money and they are happy. There is something we can all say we regret from our lives. I regret regretting. Everyday I've lived has come to this moment and even after all the things that have gone wrong recently, I can pretty much say I'm happy with they way my life has turned out. I'm happy with who I am behind my mask. I am happy with what I know and what I want to know. Lately I've been wanting to die. Actually no, I wanted to want to die. Depression is all about seeing those bad moments and ignoring the good times in your life. When you're depressed the only thing that matters are the bad times. I don't think I was stupid for wanting to want to die. When something goes wrong you tend to act out of spite as soon as it happens because you are so overwhelmed with the moment. Most people do this - it doesn't mean we're stupid it just means we got carried away and we sometimes do things without thinking. Now I'm starting to realize that the break up with Scott was a good thing. We were forcing something that wasn't making either of us happy. Of course I didn't think about either him or me and our happiness I just wanted to keep us together for as long as possible. Besides I have too many other things going on in my life right now that I need to work on and if we were still together I would have ignored these things. I don't want to become one of those people who throw their entire lives in their online journal so I won't go into everything that is going on with me. If you're my friend you know. I'm through acting like someone else in order to please people. This is my life and I'm the one living it. Other people won't be around my whole life but I will so therefore I'm putting myself and my happiness first. No more staying in one place because I'm afraid of change. I want to experience as much as I can because to me that is what life is all about. No more dwelling on the past it can't be changed - move onto today that's were things are happening and decisions need to be made. I don't want to slip off the road by looking the wrong way like I did on my driving test which by the way I failed. But that's ok, there's always next Thursday. OK enough with the things I've already learned and experienced. Onto new things, new places, and new people. I'm tired of feeling sorry for myself and wanting to be someone else. I'm going to be me again and do what makes me happy. I'm going to take advantage of the help I'm getting and I'm going to help myself get better and not depend on others to save me.

It's as if my brain is just trying to make something of depression, which ultimately makes it worse because it gives part of my brain comfort in depression, as it least it gives me some kind of identity. I imagine it as being this huge struggle with myself, almost like a character in a movie or a book and glorify the worst parts of it to provide myself with any comfort I can. It's pretty toxic but it's one of the only ways I can deal with it, does anyone else find themselves doing a similar thing? ",SpookyImmobilisedToe.txt
1,"I moved 2,000 miles away for college six years ago. Parents have never visited I'm unsure how to feel.  I moved to the other side of the country (USA) six years ago because I was accepted to a wonderful school in California.  My parents aren't too wealthy but are firmly middle class.  I could not afford to trac back home because I was barely living paycheck to paycheck until recently.  I paid for everything myself - textbooks, housing, transportation.  Of course, they helped out a bit as holiday gifts, but I've never received a care package or any extra aid. I am graduating next month and feel a bit sad that my parents aren't even sure they want to come for my graduation or party (that I'm paying for myself!).  My mom said she's busy with work and has to coordinate a lot.  She always says ""maybe next summer we'll make a trip out there!""  I'm the first person in my family to graduate college and it's kinda sad that nobody in my family cares to recognize how hard it was to do this on my own. I last called my dad in mid-December for his birthday.  I wanted to see how long it would take him to actually call me.  It's been three months and I've not heard a word from him. I was thinking about going back home this summer for a month, but am starting to question whether I should or not.  I love my life here and wish they cared enough to see it.  They have no clue what I do for work, what my degree is in, or where exactly I live.  It's been six years!  My mom just bought a house so I know she's at least had some money for a $300 plane ticket. What should I do?  Visit this summer and pretend everything is fine?  Wait it out and see how long it takes one of them to call me?

Wondering if anyone can tell me it's all going to be okay in the sense that 65 is not that old, and that I still have time to make memories and learn from my dad at his age. I'm 26. The concept of him having nothing new to teach me and needing me to take care of him now is truly devastating, because it's hitting me how much time has gone by, and just the idea of me being more capable than my father is a bit scary. He's healthy, smart, independent, wise. He still seems the same as he always did except for being a bit more gray, and you can see the age in his face a bit clearer. He drives himself around, works, volunteers, has a long distance relationship. He just seems to be a bit upset and nervous about the state of my life. Like I'm always complaining and yammering about something and it's hard on him. Yet all he wants to do is help me, so he keeps trying, and every time, he just gets put through the ringer and it's hard on him.

0,"I am overwhelmed by guilt over my boyfriend's sexual assault of my once-best friend. My boyfriend of 2 years and I both suffer from mental health issues and trauma. I found out somewhat recently that months ago, when my then-best friend was sleeping over we were both asleep in the bed and he touched her sexually. Apparently he was stoned and thought he might start a threesome (it was casually mentioned as a possibility earlier). I know what he did was horrible. It makes me sick to my stomach to think that I was there and couldn't help. It makes me throw up and stay up at night knowing that I stayed with him. On the other hand, he himself is absolutely sick with guilt. He's been having non-stop anxiety attacks, crying spells, and moments of catatonia and he can't stop saying how horrible it was that he did that and how he wants to be a good person. I believe he is genuine and my first reaction is to make sure he gets treatment so nothing close to that ever happens again. He checked himself into a psychiatric ward last night. I'm also so overwhelmed by guilt by how selfish my internal response has been. He has cheated on me before multiple times, and I can't help but ruminate on how if I were prettier this wouldn't have happened and how it effects me. One recent (smaller) time just happened and I've had to take care of his emotions while being angry about this main terrible incident and that one. Furthermore, I'm selfishly worried about how badly this is affecting me. One of the few (maybe only?) things going right in my life is school and this is affecting me so negatively in my inability to concentrate or motivate myself. I'm also upset by how critical others have been of me in this even though they are at least partially justified. He posted his story to Reddit and got mostly cautious support. I posted mine and got a lot of messages calling me a pervert, an enabler, a shitposter, and a terrible person. He told his parents and one of the things they said was ""all three of you made mistakes"". Unrelated, but last night he posted a photo of us in the ER and a girl who hates me replied ""ew you're back with her? Nonono what are you doing.""

I just can't let it out to the person that actually needs to hear it most..  I don't understand why I'm always in this kind of relationship over and over again..

When we hang out as couples, everything is fine and we get along great. We have a similar education level and both come from a science background, so it's easy for us to talk.

I planned a surprise party for my fiances 30th birthday that I had been talking about for months--her husband was there, and at the last minute, she couldn't attend.

I find myself wondering why I persist in this constant struggle with my shape. It seems like no matter how much I cut back or how much I exercise, I don't change all that much. I'm supposed to hit the Dr in 2 weeks to have her tell me I'm too fat. Thrilling, eh?   Also we have shifting managerial garbage over at work, and that has me stressed out. I  want  assistant manager really badly. I don't know if it'll ever happen. At this point, I'm afraid to transfer over to the other store I'm offered right now because of a few things.  One, the store itself is a nightmare. Everyone steals. Employees, customers, you name it.  Two, It's huge. More work. I feel like I bust my ass as it is. The story I hear about the new place is that no matter what happens, no matter what you do, it always gets undone. No matter how fast. You come in next shift and it's a warzone.  Three, The drive time. I don't want to commute again. I like having my 5 minutes to and from.  Now.. it's a good thing to transfer. Bigger store = more money and more hours. But that doesn't mean that it'll compensate for the amount of time taken from my day or the cash guzzling car's gas tank I'll be paying out the nose for.  The largest deterrant, however, is the fact that I'll have to close during the week. I don't want to. Closing's a pain in the ass. Sure, it's the easier of the two shifts, but hey, I don't like being up that late and not having anything to do when you get home because it's too late to watch a movie and you're too wound up to sleep. The only plus to that is that most likely, I'd no longer have to do inventory shifts.   At any rate, I decided not to take it. I just have to call the boss and tell her tomorrow. I want it, but they'd have to at least give me a 1.15 raise just to have me do it. That's what my time's going to cost them if they want me down there that badly. Which they won't. Heh.

I think she may be bipolar. One night she told me she cut herself a little bit. On her thigh. At first I thought she was joking. She showed me the mark if lefted in the morning and I knew it was serious. She is 16 and I am 18. She has told me before she wants to die. She has had a bad past with men but I won't go into any details. It was just really bad. She doesn't talk to her parents about it just me. Her mother and father may get a divorce so that makes this situation even worse. She can be really happy at times then really down. We get in fights sometimes but they are usually resolved. She always complains she is a bad gf because she treats me like shit. I forgive her for doing so because of her shit life. Today we were just talking casually and a few mins later she said I will kms on said date. Then I told her why would u. She said love u bye. We then went back and forth until I decided to leave her alone. She said she wasn't feeling ok. But I have never heard her give me a date before. Saying you will is one thing but a date means you have planned out how u want to go. I didn't tell my parents the full story and neither has she. She has tried killing herself before. I didn't know her at the time. She doesn't have any friends in real life and the ones she does have just use her. She is also behind in school which stresses her out.

0,Okay so I'm doing a really shitty job of keeping up with this journal. So Sam came and went. Not before I went to a wedding and got drunk and told her parents that I was in love with her . Yea.. umm.. I'm gay. I then told her that I thought moving to Oregon was a bad bad idea. Not because I was in love with her but because moving to a city for a boy that you're in love with but has no interest in you. Not such a good idea. so anyways that made things all fucked up and she left and we weren't on the best terms  besides that the roommate thing just kind of fell apart. I didn't get the apartment across from shaye because of credit issues. So now I'm going to just move into her place. We'll see how that turns out... If we kill each other or not. I'm not on the lease so if it sucks I can just move out � there are a few boys that are into me. However I don't think that my soul really wants to be with anyone right now. I have something wrong with my heart  I'm doing blood work on Monday to figure out what's going on. And I took last week off for no reason at all. So I guess a lot has happened in the last 15 days.

0,"Why my relationship is killing me Okay, disclaimer, former relationship... but it still has a huge effect on my life. This girl was my best friend and my first serious relationship. I met her when I first got depressed, and we went to the same church together. I told her then that I didn't feel ready for a relationship, but she essentially stalked me all those (5) years ago. Christmas 2016, after dealing with a crap load more grief and depression, I was essentially forced into a relationship with her.  I had just got over my main stint of depression the previous September, and my life was getting better. We still hung out as friends, but she kept pushing for more. However, she is so messed up.  I have to say that now. I do still love her, and that will probably never change, but she needs professional help, and my mistake was thinking I could help her.  She was my best friend after all. So, after a string of breakups, moving too slow and moving too fast, as well as her cheating on my several times, she finally called it quits one week after my birthday (November just gone). I had no say, because she'd throw a tantrum, but I had to take the initiative. Why?  Because she no longer wanted to have my baby. In August, she fell pregnant.  This could have been the week prior the Anniversary of our first kiss, but the nurse dated it on that specific date.  That was one of the nights she cheated on me, with her friend's boyfriend, but it was ""just a kiss"". She tried to miscarry by drinking heavily for the next few weeks before coming to me about it; she had broken up with me the day after she cheated. I asked her there and then if she wanted to keep it.  She said yes. We went to speak to my mum.  My mum asked her.  She said yes. She wanted to announce the pregnancy, to start all the planning, and looking forward to the future. I got a well paying job to provide for our future, a job I travelled hundreds of miles for each week, and it was only for a few months. But whilst I was away, she decided she missed all the drinking, drugs, and sex she was missing out on.  She wanted to live with her friends (who she actually hates living with at times), and countless other reasons. However, she kept stringing me along until the scan, where she sent me a photo of our child before telling me she wanted to abort it.  Oh, and I had planned a weekend away for us to relax and see some friends. She had me believe this was the start of my happy ever after, before ripping it away from me. She didn't speak to me for two weeks. When I finally did manage to get in touch, it was to collect my stuff.  I took a mutual friend with me, the act as a buffer, and they couldn't believe the stuff that she said to me. Then I get a load of hate off her because people are contacting her about her choices. Remember, she has been posting on FB all about the baby, making sure everyone knows. She hasn't spoken to me since.  She has blocked me anyway she can, even on WhatsApp only recently... not that it matters, because she wants nothing to do with me. This was my best friend, and my stalker, who for years wanted to be with me, have a family with me, worried I wouldn't want her because of PCOS, and got jealous over people talking to me on Twitter, and kittens!  She couldn't even handle me showing up with chocolates and flowers! All that I've done for her, supported her, sacrificed for her... and this is how she treats me. Now, I am pro-life, and pro-choice.  I gave her that choice, and she wanted to go ahead.  I didn't force her or convince her.  She led me. She set me up, just to rip out my heart. Seriously, if you only knew the half of it.  The card she wrote for me for my birthday alone would have anyone convinced. But now, she is living her life.  She is out drinking, smoking, doing drugs and sleeping with anything she can get her claws into. She has restarted her YouTube ""career"", and quite frankly, they're boring videos. Maybe she'll do better.  I hope not.  But I think that's normal. So why this post? Because it is killing me.  I don't know how, but I'm still kicking.  Depression is creeping at my door, and I do have horrible days, bad days where I am so demotivated. Yet, I cannot stop thinking about her.  She has me broken, in ruins... even my faith has been hit hard. I don't understand what changed.  I don't understand she did what she did.  Why did she play me for so long just to hurt me? Everyone tells me to forget about her, and no one would allow me to go back to her (even if it was a possibility). All I want to do is to forget about her, because as the title says... this relationship is killing me. ",Quin452.txt
0,"Feeling Good is an excellent book. I have re-read a few times when I've felt the need.

0,"Hello I'm 25 from the UK, I have suffered from depression I would say most of my life, but have only been on medicines (20mg of Prozac) for just over 2 years on and off, I've had times off the medicines and relapsed back into depression and the last time I saw my doctor he said It would be better for me to stay on antidepressants long term. The Prozac is working for me at the moment However I find the medicines interrupt my sleep and I wake 3 or 4 times a night and the sleep I do get is very light and ""dreamy"" sleep, plus I seem to be a bit lightheaded and reckless, on my motorbike for example I do stupid things like speeding and other dangerous stuff (to myself not others), which before off the medicines I would never do because I was very paranoid and cautious. I was off Prozac for a while late last year and things went down hill fast, I was cutting my arms and wanted to kill myself, I felt I had no reason to live, I was drinking to relive the depression, and I was drinking about 10 to 12 cans of lager(or 3 bottles of wine) a night, thinking about it I was wrecking my liver and feeling even more depressed in the morning, plus I was putting on loads of weight with all the beers, which was another reason to make me feel like crap. After New Year I made the decision (with my doctor) to go back on the antidepressants, and cut the booze almost out (I still drink about 1 or 2 a night but that's all) because things could not get any worse. I feel a lot better, I am back in the gym and getting back into shape, and my job is going well, I am in a recovery stage at the moment, I just hope I don't f--k it up again like before.

0,"I want to share my experience moving to NYC from Israel - four months ago Hello everyone, I just thought it would do good for me to share my experience moving to this city among other new yorkers and maybe hearing some new voices of people who are living here and know better than me or even went through the same thing. So basically, I'm 28 years old and moved to NYC four months ago with my wife. My wife is doing her Ph.D. at Columbia University, and I just joined her (with a work permit during our stay here), and we are going to be here for at least 3.5 years, but we could choose to stay for five years if we wish to. (At the moment I don't see it happening) I have to say that moving here has been the most difficult challenge I've ever been through in my life. First, though my English is not bad at all, I'm SO, SO insecure about it. I'm feeling afraid to open my mouth and say complicated things, and it is depressing me. (I am a person who's talking a lot by nature. I've always been like that) And I feel like someone took away that ability from me and I'm much less charismatic in English than in Hebrew which affects my confidence tremendously... After smoking weed for 4-5 years almost every day in Israel, I quit doing it since the first month I got here only because it made me feel very anxious (it used to make me feel quite the opposite before) I used to be a teacher in Israel and pretty quickly I've found a job as a teacher that teaches Hebrew here in New York. (In Israel I used to teach History which I found much more interesting than teaching a language, but that's what I got here, so I have to live with that) A few days ago, I had a conversation with my boss, and apparently, they are pleased by my work there, and they asked me if I am willing to continue for next year which is nice to hear even though I don't like this job that much. I guess I will have to compromise. My wife and I are supported by an excellent scholarship, and we don't have to worry a lot about money or health insurance so, on the financial field, we are kinda covered. But being here makes me feel powerless. Obviously, I don't have my good friends here with me, and I feel much less ""special"" as a person. I feel like I am only one among millions who are trying to survive in this big hectic city. In the beginning, I thought it is beautiful that this city is full of people from all around the world, but now it just feels to me that everyone are strangers to each other and it seems like it is the loneliest city in the world at the moment. And because I don't have friends here and I am married (so meeting with girls on tinder etc. is not an option) I don't have many reasons to leave the house and it is kinda sad. The only reasons I'm leaving my house is for yoga classes, work, and restaurants with my wife. Other than that I don't have any other reasons to leave the house... The weather is fucking horrible, and it is so cold it is painful to me being outside. Anyways, I don't expect from you guys to be my therapist or giving me some life-changing advices... I guess I post this to release some steam. So if you managed to read my post until the end, Thank you :) And I hope things will improve for me. I've always lived in Israel and only left for trips. The longest was 3-4 months, and I have never relocated my life to anywhere else. So maybe it is just a matter of time until I will start to feel more like home here. If you have anything to share from your experience, that would be lovely just to know that I am not the only one who is going through this adjustment period. Thanks again for reading and for your patience. Have a great week everyone ",PaniCush.txt
1,"Is My Friend A Bad Friend? I have a friend. When I moved to a foreign country, I went to a school and met this friend. We have been quite close but after I moved back to my country, we’ve only been communicating through texts. She has been a helpful friend but I don’t know if she is a good friend or a bad friend. There were many occasions when I wondered if I should break friends with her, but I always told myself that she didn’t mean to ever hurt me and I kept on trying my best to act like nothing was wrong and acted friendly. But I srsly can’t hold it in and I wanna know if I’m just being sensitive.. These are some of the things she does that makes me wonder if we should break friends.. 1.We use eachother’s selfies as our profile pics and I always use the best selfies of hers or at least what I think are the best looking ones. And I sent her a video if me singing with my other friend and she took a screenshot in the middle of the video and used it as her profile pic and My mouth was wide open and my eyes were scrunched up and it really looked horrible and when I asked her to change it, she asked what I meant and that it didnt look bad. Sure she couldve been being nice and I could’ve been acting emotional but I really didn’t like other people who I didn’t even know seeing a photo like this so I pleaded her to change it but I tried to keep the joking and friendly mood. However then she said “Funny. U wouldn’t wanna see the other screenshot I took.” And we both didn’t say anything. And she didn’t change it. 2.The way she texts me depends on her mood. If she isn’t feeling friendly, she barely answers my texts and replies with short answers and doesn’t laugh at anything funny I have to say. I wondered if I could also be acting like that at times but I looked back at our conversations and ai never let my mood change the way I replied to her, and I honestly didn’t even speak in an unfriendly way when she said something rude to me or something that made me feel offended. 3.She doesn’t act like she cares for what I have to say. Whenever something bad happens to me and I tell her, she just gives a small reaction and talks about something else. 4.She ignores my texts. There was once a time when she saw my texts and didnt reply. I asked why she didn’t reply and she saw it but ignored it. I thought that maybe she had something important going on so I just kept on texting her every few hours like nothing was wrong cuz I don’t exactly like showing others when I feel hurt. She read my texts and ignored me for two whole days and finally texted me back as if nothing had happened. She didn’t apologize for not replying nor did she give an explanation. She just texted me about something else she wanted to say. There were lots of cases like this. 5.She acts like she has the worst life. I go through alot of stress each day cuz I have had family troubles and sometimes had been bullied. I have also often had suicidal thoughts. However whenever I tell her about things that are stressing me out, she points out that her life is worse. I understand that she has her own troubles but I really dont like the way she underestimates my life and doesn’t care for it. 6.She once cyber bullied me. When I left her school and left the country, we had a small fight and she told her friends about the bad things I had once said, not mentioning her faults. She then invited me to a group chat with lots of people and they all fought against me, calling me fat,ugly,short,stupid,and dumb. They also made racial comments and insulted my mom. After a year passed, I texted her. I can’t believe I did it, but I said that I WAS SORRY. And she said that she forgave me and now we’re talking like friends again. But whenever I bring up a little detail from the past, she gets mad and says that I am blaming her for the past and makes me feel guilty for something I shouldn’t be guilty about. 7.She thinks that she is perfectly innocent. I’m not saying shes a totally horrible person, she can be a good friend at times, but I gotta admit that at times she can be horrid.. And whenever something bad happens to her, she says that she doesn’t get what she did to deserve it and that she is getting mistreated. If you think about it that way, I feel like I also deserve this, considering Im not a saint or an angel. But whenever my friend says that she didnt do anything bad to deserve some bad things that happened to her, I can’t help but feel disappointed at the fact that she doesn’t realize  how much she hurted me What should I do..? Am I just being sensitive..? ",rladldus05.txt
1,"Friend threatened to ruin my therapists life over a joke. OK so I had a bit of a blur of boundaries with my therapist. It wasn't a big deal.

I told her to promise to keep it a secret even if I died. Nothing happened between me and my therapist and we never slept together, but things were a bit... Weird i guess. Some of the stuff my therapist said could make her lose her job. Anyway I pranked my friend today by photoshopping a fake conversation between me and my college tutor. In the convo I told them my friend referred to him as ""daddy nick"" behind his back. It was merely a joke and I didn't really message the tutor any of this. She freaked out when I sent her the photoshopped convo. And her immediate response was: ""I'm going to ruin your therapists life for this!"" I told her it was a joke and a prank. She demanded evidence which i gave her... She then acted as though things were fine when they weren't. She said if I ever do anything like that again she'll ruin my therapists life.

He wanted to elope, but I feel I deserve a wedding after all that I've been through. We live in different places. I, with the children at my parents house, and him with his mother and family.        His mother had a kidney transplant in December. I understand that he wants to be there for her. But my children and I suffer greatly.  He never comes around. When he does, she (or his sister) calls and he leaves.        Sometimes I think she exaggerates her pain (maybe I sound a little selfish) or maybe exaggerate isn't what I mean. I think she tolerates her pain until she wants attention. I feel bad for her because she suffers alot. But at the same time. I never get to see my ""fiance"" , my kids never get to see their father.     There is a house down the street from her. And the people want around $700    monthly for a 3 bedroom house.  He decided (without me even seeing it) that it wasn't good enough because the house is blue, fiends (drug addicts)   lived   there, and the kitchen is yellow. He can't see taking us from where we are now to move there.        He lives in a 3 bedroom house with about 6 people and a dog. I live in a big 4 bedroom house with my parents, and I am cramped. My son doesn't like to stay here because he thinks my parents don't like him.  My daughter has to stay upstairs with me, because they yell about the house being dirty. She doesn't like it there much either. But he doesn's see moving us from here, because of a freakin yellow kitchen.       I haven't been able to sleep or really eat since he told me this last night.  If anyone can give me a honest opinion on what's really good, I'd really appreciate it. ",4101975.200408010.female.25.txt
1,"this title is more of what i am looking for than what i am offering. i was looking for a way to start some good conversations on this topic but was unsure as to where i should go to do so....until now. so, that is what i am wondering. personally, i think that for the most part, the church has missed the point over the last 500 years or so but this has become more evident in recent years, as illustrated by this excerpt from ""Blue Like Jazz"":       ""In a recent radio interview I was sternly asked by the host, who did not consider himself a Christian, to defend Christianity. I told him that I couldn’t do it, and moreover, that I didn’t want to do defend the term. He asked me if I was a Christian and I told him yes. “Then why don’t you want to defend Christianity?” he asked, confused. I told him I no longer knew what the term meant. Of the hundreds of thousands of people listening to his show that day, some of them had terrible experiences with Christianity, they may have been yelled at by a teacher in a Christian school, abused by a minister, or browbeaten by a Christian parent. To them, the term Christianity meant something that no Christian I know would defend. By fortifying the term, I am only making them more and more angry. I won’t do it. Stop ten people on the street and ask them what they think of when they hear the word Christianity and they will give you ten different answers. How can I defend a term that means ten different things to ten different people? I told the radio show host that I would rather talk about Jesus and how I came to believe that Jesus exists and that he likes me. The host looked back at me with tears in his eyes. When we were done, he asked me if we could go get lunch together. He told me how much he didn’t like Christianity but how he had always wanted to believe Jesus was the son of God.""    i am not saying that i disagree with the teaching of Jesus nor with that of the Bible but rather with the fundamental ring-wing Christianity of the 20th century. what are your thoughts on christian spirituality?

1,"Are my friends leaving me out on purpose? This has been bugging me for a while, I mean I've gotten to the point where I've made a Reddit account to vent about it. So I'm on of those girls who has two best friends, I'm sure you can already see where this is headed (I'll call them Susie and Amy). When I started secondary school I didn't have any friends since I had joined out with my school catchment area. Although, I met Susie and she quickly became my best friend. We were in a big group of girls which included Amy. Amy and Susie had become close since they lived near each other and had had lots of sleepovers and days out together and stuff. I had made friends with a girl called Ruby who was Amy's best friend at the time and eventually Amy and Ruby fell out, causing the group to split up and because I was closer to Susie, I went with her. This left Amy, Susie, and I to form a little ""squad"" and the three of us were extremely close for the next three years. Some things happened with Susie which resulted in Amy and I falling out with her for about 10 months. Nothing big, just usual girly bitching and drama. Amy and I became extremely close during this time but something Amy told me really hurt. When we were in the process of making up with Susie, Susie had told Amy that she considered Amy to be the closest person to her. That couldn't be right? I went to Susie's house every Friday? I helped her out with her chores whenever I was over, I stayed over almost every weekend, I went on trips with her and her family all the time, we sat next to each other in almost every class, we constantly texted and called and she wouldn't hesitate to tell me every detail of her life and problems and neither would I. Amy had a job and was always working weekends, she was also never the type to text people or even call since she was always with her sister. So why did Susie consider her closer? It really stung but I got over it. My issue now is that since the three of us have made up I can't help but feel a little excluded. I'll only give one example since everything's of a similar nature. We've been off school for the past three days because of the snow. I saw that Susie was at Amy's house on the first day, I was a little bummed about not being invited but I brushed it off since it could've just been a spontaneous visit. But Susie is at Amy's Mothers house today, I'm assuming she's staying over, and it's not like I live an hour away. I live a 15 minute walk away, it would only take 5 minutes to get a lift there and the snow isn't bad anymore. So...did I do something to warrant not being invited? Usually Amy would always invite me over, we would have loads of sleepovers... And y'know to top it all off, my Grandma passed away on Tuesday, Susie had met my grandma and visited her with me a lot and even though I had told her what happened she messaged me later to ask why I seemed sad, only to act shocked and say she 'never realised' that my grandma had died even though I had already told her. Amy knew my grandma had died too but she hasn't said a word to cheer me up. These girls aren't awkward or unsympathetic either, they've taken care of me when someone has passed away before. Are they being like this on purpose? TL;DR Close friends I've had for years are excluding me, is it on purpose or by accident? ",hhj29.txt
0,"Hello everyone, I am new here. I am Sarah and in my early thirties. I live in Europe and found this forum today! I just want to share my thoughts and because I was afraid anyone would find out about my feelings I searched for a foreign forum. And found it! I have been struggling all my life but after a series of events (death of dear aunt and suicide attempt off parent) I found myself starting therapy almost 2 years ago. At first everything was fine and I was learning a lot about myself and how to make my life easier and how to love myself. i really was hopeful and thought my life would finally get happier and maybe I would even meet some one to share my life with.... After a year of therapy I started feeling worse about myself and developed an eating disorder and a few months ago I also started feeling more and more depressed. At first I denied everything and even threatened to quit therapy because I was convinced time would heal me....well I now know that healing is not that easy. over the past two weeks I have been to a psychiatrist who wants to start me on Prozac (because it shouldn't make me gain weight, she thinks this would be the best ad. for me) and earlier this week i went to see my usual psychotherapist who said I was severely depressed and she urged me to start taking the medication because of my state of mind. I might loose my job in the near future and with all this extra stress my thoughts have been very scary. I am starting to think more and more about death and for this reason my therapist started talking about hospitalization! Off course I don't want that so I agreed earlier today to start with the medication....I am so scared about the side effects and don't know what i will do if I gain weight. Also I don't think I want to life if I loose my job...I think that will push me over the edge. I hope I can find the energy to read more messages on this board and maybe get a good feeling about life again. Bye for now, Sarah ",sarahnicole_e_2_b_1_xx.txt

My childhood dog had to be putdown. Bone issues. Everytime I think of anything that gives me anxiety I feel the need to pick at my skin. My face is red and scabbed. I dissapoint everyone because I was the one destined to be smart and be the first (family name) with a degree and stable job. I turn 18 next month. No job experience. I get my photo id next week. Its very late because my parents lost my birth certificate. Set me back a lot. My mum is suddenly rushing for me to get Centrelink (welfare), so she can take half of each payment. We barely have food in the house most days because she uses her welfare on cigs and bills. I feel like I do nothing. Everyday is just nothing. In bed, video games, browsing internet, sex, video games, sad music and alcohol. Rinse and repeat. No joy. I want a social life and a hobby. I want a job.

0,"My formative years were spent in small towns. Until the third grade, I lived in Indiana. From the third grade through my junior year in high school, I lived in a small lakeside community in southwestern Michigan. You could walk or ride your bike to anywhere - down to the lake, out on country roads, wherever. My father was a Lutheran school teacher, principal and church organist. From time to time, he would take a ""call"" to serve in another Lutheran school in a different town. In the summer of 1968, right after my junior year in high school, he decided to take a call to a school in the north side of the city of St. Louis. It was quite a culture shock for a sheltered young woman who had only lived in small, insular towns all her life, to move to a city the size of St. Louis. Quite honestly, when we arrived here I absolutely hated it. I felt as if I'd been thrown to the dark side of the moon. I had to start my senior year in a new high school in a completely foreign environment. Everyone else already had their group or circle of friends going back at least three years. Now you had to have a lot more guts and fortitude and self-esteem than I had at the time to break into already established groups and make new friends. This was the year that would set the stage for the first major depressive episode in my life. This was the year of my first therapist, the first of many to come. The start of a lifetime of self-discovery. ",repsychleink_e_2_b_1_us.txt
1,"I saw Leif yesterday.  For those of you who don't know he used to be my old roommate and a good friend of mine until he tried to rip me off anyway he could with rent and bills.  He also lied to me every opportunity he got, and then he had the audacity to tell Ryan that I lie all the time about everything.  I really could care less if I ever see him again.        Anyway, I was walking through the mall with Ryan and her mom yesterday and he and his daughter were looking at purses.  I saw him and I tried to get away from him without him noticing me.  It didn't work.  ""Yeah, that's right, Adam.  You just keep on walking,"" he said.  ""Okay,"" I responded and I kept on walking.  He responded with, ""Shmuck!""  And then he saw Ryan and said, ""Hey, baby.  How are you?""  I guess he still likes her.  I have no idea.  I really hope that's the last time I see him but I doubt it is.  A few weeks ago Ryan and I were driving back to her house and when we got to her street he was driving past us.  We turned around to see if that was him, and he turned around and drove past us again.  We turned down another street to get back to her house.  He passed us again.  Each time he covered his face, and Jennifer (another former roommate of ours who is now dating Leif) covered her face so I guess we wouldn't recognize her.  We never saw him again that day, but is he stalking me now?  Was he just bored so he got his two kids and girlfriend in the car and set out to find me?  Will I ever be rid of this guy?    Last night, I got home and Belinda (my roommate for another month) was in the kitchen.  She was leaving to go stay at a friend's house for the night, but before she left she told me that my room smelled bad.  She blamed it on my shoes or trash in my trash can.  She told me I needed to get some candles or an air freshener.  This caused a fight.  It was our first fight since moving into the place last August.  The only thing that I smell in my room is the air freshener that she put into my room a month ago that smells horrible.  My shoes are brand new and therefore do not stink.  The only trash I have in my room is paper.  My room is the only room in the house that actually smells good.  The rest of the house smells like her sausage and Slim Jims.  Anyway, I cleaned my room last night and hopefully she'll be happy now.  I only have three more weeks left in this place and after that I won't have to deal with this anymore.

0,"Hi all, I am in hell of major depression. After being for over 8 years on Elavil and Valium(small dosage), with good results for most of the time, I tapered down because of the side effects and have been drug free for 1 year. During this year the depression slowly settled in making my life unbearable lately. I don't know what to do. I saw 2 psychiatrists within last month. One of them wanted me on Paxil and the second one on Effexor. Problem is I am so afraid of side effects that I can't begin taking any of them, meantime my life is falling to pieces. My nervous system was completely messed up by these medicines. I had severe fasciculation of muscles for over 4 months after being medicine free (sign of tardive dyskinesia, untreatable neurological condition) and get them back whenever I try any supplement that would increase serotonin level (SAMe, St. John's Wort, Rhodiola). My memory got better after I stopped the medication but now it's falling apart because of the depression I get de-realized I mean if depression won't kill me these medicines will. What are my alternatives (if any)? Shall I take these medicines, for the time being, endure side effects and expose myself to degenerative damage? Shall I stay away from medicines and get incapacitated by depression? Is there any alternative treatment for major depression? I would appreciate any advice. Dania ",zena_e_2_b_1_xx.txt

Within the past 3 years I have struggled on and off with this disease. For the most part I've had it under control, until relatively recently. About four months ago I was drastically descending downwards mental health wise. The result of this declination helped obstruct all aspects of my social life, causing an abrupt, painful end to many friendships I endeared. Also my negative behavior started to poison. The equilibrium that my family and I shared. The result of all this lead not only to my choice of isolation , but even if I chose not to isolate myself, I still had damaged relationships so much, that any attempts to make amends, and or repair former friendships, were futile. I basically pushed and alienated myself from everything I held dearest. Anyways, one day I just snapped; my ability to process information, perform simple math equations, remember things I had JUST thought of seconds before, concentrate, quick wit, and confident decision making had all been impaired immensely. Previously, before all of this, I was an ""A"" Honor Role student and had no difficulty functioning efficiently in my ""AP"" classes, but now I can barely sustain a low ""B"" average.

I have my ~~only~~ own little nuclear family now and she is renovating a house with her long time boyfriend. Since we have been adults we have noticed that our parents marriage isn't exactly happy. Our parents are basically polar opposites. Dad is a really outgoing people person who likes to have lots of activities and friends. However, he is very very emotional and can blow up at the slightest hint of ""disrespect."" If something is wrong it is never his fault, you know the type. Mom is quiet and reserved, not much on physical or verbal affection at all. Her only hobby/activity is through music ministry at our church. My dad joined the church when they got married, but he isn't religious really and only comes on the holidays. Lately my sister has been really distressed by our parents relationship. She is very empathetic and it really upsets her when they fight. So much so, that she does not want to be around them anymore because of it. Today she told me that she thinks we should have some sort of intervention with them about their marriage. My sister and I have discussed before that they probably should really be divorced, but that it will never happen because our mom is Catholic.

I try to keep to myself and mind my own business, and don’t care to hag out with people. We met at work, and I liked that there was so much that we had in common, almost like I could see myself in her. We became friends. However, there has been a few instances that make me question her friendship. We are both waitresses, and she would ask me how my night was and how much I made. It made me feel a bit uncomfortable, because the way she asked seemed a bit odd. If I would make more than her she would seem a little upset, if she made more, she seemed to be happy. Even now when I make more than her she says “I hate you”. She says I’m her “best friend” and gets mad if I hang out with someone else without her knowing, tag/get tagged by other people on FB, or go places without inviting her. Although, she does all of these things as well, but I don’t get upset or mention them. When we started working at a different restaurant, right off the bat, there were people that didn’t like me. These are people that are problematic, and always cause drama (which I cannot tolerate). Well, my friend knowing that these people talked behind my back, hated me, and made up rumors about me, decided to invite on them to her house!

1,"Might have gotten my friend fired at work First of all: hello! I’m just gonna jump right in. So I (23/f) have been best friends with this girl (let’s call her maya) for about 3 1/2 Years now. Another girl (we will go with Ashley) became part of our group about a year later and maya asked us to start working at the restaurant she served at part time. Eventually, maya started a thing with this guy who was in a relationship at the time, so we obviously didn’t really put a lot of hope into the whole thing. But eventually he broke up with the other girl to be with maya. Now she started really getting into weed (like 3 blunts a day all by herself) and then dropping pills on the weekends. Ashley and I are not into it so we stayed away but tried to still hang out but it got more and more difficult being with her because she either a) fell asleep b) throw up all the time c) was just super uncomfortable to be around. Also work got fucking disastrous because she asked us to pick her up and every single time she either overslept or just forgot about it... so we were always late with her. Last week it really excalated: she left Ashley hanging for over an hour, didn’t pick up her phone, I cancelled all my plans to go to work instead of maya and or coworker was all by himself with a huge group of guests. And all she did was send us a voice mail telling us what we should tell our boss. (Not even a reason why all of it happened) Obviously, we were both really pissed and I just told our superior what had happened and why I was there instead of her. Needless to say he was mad and said that our boss has to talk to her about this because it obviously just a big no go. The issue is, she kind of expected us to lie for her and I don’t think I can deal with that anymore. She has become so enstranged lately and I don’t want to support her selfish and self-destructive behaviour. But now I guess I might have made her lose her job and i don’t know if I should apologise and try to talk our boss into letting her stay or just accept that she’ll hate me forever and go on with my life. I’ve told her that I don’t like the whole drug thing but she laughed it off, called me a coward and sheltered. But she also treats me (and Ashley to an extend) like her servants and all my other friends can’t stand to be around her. So really, i don’t know how to approach her with the whole situation because in the end I’m going to be the horrible friend that ruined her life. Should I apologise or/and try to damage control the whole thing at work?

1,"How should I deal with this flaky friend? I have a friend who I totally love who ALWAYS flakes. whether the plans are big or small 95% of the plans we make (initiated by her often) end up with ""I don't feel like going out"" or ""i made other plans"" or ""i don't remember making these plans"" etc. This is super annoying and all but it's not the whole problem. Since she's super flaky I always call her out on it or joke about it. for example: In our group chat another friend will make plans and she'll be like ""ok its set"" and then i'll reply like ""that only means it's half set"" and I know I'm being snarky and all but she deserves it for being such a flake! right? Anyway I guess it really annoys her when i do this so she confronted me about it calling me a bitch for always making jokes about her being flaky and asked me not to do it anymore. I agreed but I kind of wish I didn't and now i feel like not even replying when we talk in our group chat. Im sure making snarky comments about someone being a flake can't be anywhere near as annoying as constantly being flaked on, Right? There's been some huge plans that she flaked on including travel and birthday plans that really upset me especially since she's such a good friend and it means a lot to me for her to make it to those special occasions. Does anyone have any advice on how to move forward? Should I just pretend it never happened and continue like usual or should I say/do something? What's your experience with friends like this?

0,"Im a mess and I need to rant. Every so often, I'll find a glimmer of hope and try my hardest to change my life. I'll start exercising and eating healthy, and pushing myself to talk to people, and I'll actually feel pretty good for a few days. Then I just stop. I'll wake up one day and and have absolutely no desire to be healthy anymore and slip right back into feeling like shit and hating myself because I can't commit to the simplest of things. This is probably the fourth time it's happened in the past year. I made some really bad choices today regarding food, which made me feel so much worse because in my eyes, my worth as a human being is directly tied to the shape of my body. Nobody could  ever convince me that it's not. This past bought of motivation, I tried to convince myself that I was going to exercise and eat right for the sake of my health, but in the back of my mind, I knew the only real reason was because I wanted to lose weight. And now here I am, completely abandoned diet and exercise and right back into the throws of depression. All I want to do anymore is lay in bed and try to fall asleep. I don't have a job (or the desire to have one) and I lost most of my friends because I never talked to them. I live with my mom who I thought I could talk to about anything, but I feel like I can't tell her about how bad it's gotten. It doesn't help that she tells me everyday that I need to get a job. I know she is right, but it makes me feel like an even bigger piece of garbage because I've never held down a job for more than 4 months. If I got a job right now, I'd probably have a breakdown and quit the first week.  I went through cosmetology school and put myself into debt just to wind up hating the field and trying to lie to myself that I didn't. I thought it was all about doing hair, but it turns out it's all about trying to get people to buy some shitty hair product.

1,"Ending a friendship (This post is insanely long FYI) I have a mate [17M, nearly 18] whose currently in a relationship with a girl [just turned 16] that he is completely infatuated by. He buys her stuff constantly, despite his financial situation (more on that later) and does lots of other things (also more on that later). This friend of mine completely revolves his life around this one girl. He once told me he would do anything for her and that he would kill himself if they broke up (he's also depressed, which I think he should fix before even being in a relationship but it's too late now) he also said he would feel 100% responsible if she were to kill herself (she's not depressed. It was hypothetical. When I told him it wouldn't be his fault as everyone is responsible for their own actions, I simply received a ""shut up"". There have been many incident like this where I've truth bombed him and he's stuck his head in the sand and might as well be saying ""lalala I can't hear you!"" Unfortunately for my mate, these feelings don't appear to be reciprocated. He buys her gifts all the time, even though his mum can barely afford fuel due to her unemployment and the fact she's a single mum. He bought her a bath bomb and perfume and other stuff for her birthday (would be upwards of $50 (Australian dollars btw if that's even a concern) from a family that sometimes has $0 in their bank account when he didn't even get anyone else (including me) a gift for our birthdays. The girl doesn't even seem phased by his financial situation or his depression. If she cared, wouldn't she ask to not have gifts to help him out?. Not to mention that she hasn't bought A THING for my mate. In real life they seem like a stable couple but it's much worse. The mate also purposely neglects invites from his mates (including me) for her. We invited him to see Star Wars: The Last Jedi and he messaged her about how he didn't really want to go (me and a mate broke into his Snapchat account. His iPad charger is broken and he can't afford another one so he gave us username and password to Snapchat so we could do his streaks which apparently matter. Also this is another testiment to his financial situation. Can't afford a cheapo third party cord for his iPad) We looked through his messages and pretty much he's sending ""almost nudes"" thankfully with consent and a thotty dog filter picture (even though he would call anyone else that did it a thot to fit in) he also constantly asked to call on discord to which she replied only with ""sorry"" or ""can't"". No explanation whatsoever. Her friends are also incredibly irresponsible (thankfully he sees through that) When my mate is talking to me or anyone else. All we get is a bombardment  ""what if she doesn't like me"" and other relationship jargon. I don't care but I have to pretend to. He cannot talk about anything else ever. It's just relationship this relationship that. I'm sick of it. When he was at a very dark time in his life, me and 3 of my mates (2 girls including the girlfriend and one guy) made a group chat to talk about how we help him. We all talked very in depth except for the girlfriend. My mate asked her ""what do you think of all this were talking about (we went very in depth into his situation) to which her response was ""I don't know"" after saying NOTHING. I'm sick of his ignorance. I'm sick of him neglecting me and the other lads. I'm sick of it all. He even tried to seize control from his girlfriend. She went to hi five me and he said ""why are you bringing him over here"" in an incredibly annoyed tone"" I know I'm only the ""when Chloe isn't present talk to him isntead"" guy. He doesn't care. How do I cut him out of my life whilst causing the least ruccus possible?

0,"Alright, I've been here before, to this site and this depressed on life.  I have experience that would get any person out of depression and live a pretty well rounded life.  Only to be honest I sometimes choose i think to be down and out all the time.  I was in recovery from a drug problem for 2 years and i developed a relationship with a Higher Power that really really helped with my depression / anxieties / addictions.  So it would be insane for someone who knows the solution to not use it right?  Well i've heard it said before, that once someone who had great faith loses it it makes it  more difficult for that person to find hope or faith, so that's where i've been the past 2 1/2 months, hopeless. I tried Heroin after 2 years clean.  Looking for something to shut my mind up and find some comfortable peace due to my increasing loneliness and depression.  I only got real sick for about the two weeks i was on it and lost a job and apartment.  Then i moved back with my mom who has deep anger at my dad and life i guess who is with a man that is using her in my opinion, he's in a halfway house and just lays on her couch all day.   And my dad has deep depression / bipolar on every medication you could think of and lives with his mom who only talks about ""the divorce"" and how ""i should have did this different"" So really if i look at it long enough and deep enough they're alive but dead in a healthy emotional, spiritual, mental level, so where's the encouragement or love i so long needed as a younger person, and even most importantly i need some guidance now, instead of being ashamed of who they are. I just need to vent.  I'm 22 i just started college last week and i am extremely anxious when there, I feel as though i wear a suit, outfit, costume of misery, fear, depression, THE VOID.  So it drives others away, plus i am ashamed of being a depressive / anxious dude so keeping others away is my aim.  I mean i'm 22 i should be getting laid and having fun right?!  Man i feel so old but so immature emotionally.  I talked to a friend of mine that is at Yale in Connecticut last night who has always been a good natured, smart, artistic guy, and a person who experiences depression but doesn't let it get the best of him, and he said to not dwell in the negative like i've always done, find something through out the day that is positive, a girl smiles at you, a song whatever.

1,"Was this a true friendship? TL;DR (?) A friend that I have know for 15 years just blocked me on facebook. I have always had feelings for her but I had began to move on. I don't have a lot of friends and I always liked having her as a friend and as someone I could go to. She was willing to do this with me even when she was dating someone else. As she got more serious with the other guy she started to talk to me less and less and she started to not chat with me as much about her life but she always wanted to hear about my problems and woes. I really started to feel that something was wrong when she recently got married. We had talked about marriage a few times in previous years. She had indicated that she was unsure if she would ever get married then she said she was considering it with her bf. Then one day she moved to a the same city as her husband to be but when I asked her about why or if she was considering marrying him she said she moved because she liked it there more. She hid the fact that she was engaged from me but still allowed a friendship. I know that it shouldn't have mattered that she was getting married but I did want to be supportive of it and I also wanted to know because I felt that it would be unappropriate for us to be the same type of friends that we were. One day I called her to tell her some really bad news about something that had happened in my life. I called several times but she didn't answer because she was busy. She finally returned my call at midnight and got onto me for calling her so much and then said ""I can't do this"". Then she put severe restrictions on it saying that  I could only talk to her in sever circumstances or to tell her things but she would never initiate contact with me or make small talk with me. I got fed up and told her that it wasn't true friendship if she wouldn't reciprocate communication or tell me about major things in her life getting married. I also brought up some things from the past that made me feel the way that I feel towards her. Then she blocked me on facebook and told me that she wanted to discontinue all communication altogether. I feel like she knew that she had be wrong with me in the past but refused to admit it to me. Was this ever a true friendship? Am I wrong for feeling like my heart was torn out because of what she did? Is what she did OK from her end? Was she wrong or could she have been better about communicating this with me? I just don't know how to process what happened and I feel bad but I still feel that if I am going to call somebody a friend, I should be able to talk to them about life without limitation. I do know there are boundaries but just making small talk shouldn't violate a boundary. I am just looking for validation. I still do care about her as a person. I don't think she's evil but I do think that she doesn't have much  compassion for me. ",NdN124.txt

I just don't understand how you can be so blessed as to be able to live on the ocean and not take advantage of it ..  I do things a typical 16 year old does, I guess. I love dancing, drinking, surfing, shopping, tanning, music, movies, and just hanging out. Okay, so I'm from boca raton, and as many of you  may  have heard, girls there tend to be shallow bitches .. I happen to be neither, unless you  really  piss me off ;)  Things that I live for are sunsets, sunrises, first kisses, hockey games..& players*:P, smoothies, FSU football, chocolate covered strawberries, dancing the night away, and gazing at the stars.  I want to be famous. I'm not really sure how I'm going to go about doing this, but hey, if it happens, I'll be thrilled.  I don't take things for granted. I live life day by day, and I try not to worry about what's gonna happen tomorrow. Life is short. I believe in forgiving someone who's hurt you, even if they don't deserve it. Don't judge a book by it's cover. Spend as much time with your family as you can, especially your grandparents. You can learn more than you've ever imagined.  I've never  really  been  in  love, romantically that is. I've loved a lot, but I'm scared. Scared of being hurt, scared of loving someone so much as to not be able to live without them. Lately, I've been finding out that trying so hard  not  to love, hurts just as much.  With one look at me, you'd probably label me as a typical ""dumb"" blonde bimbo. Hopefully, if you really take the time to know me, you'll realize that, even though I do have my ditzy moments, I'm not at all like my exterior shows.  I'm a sexual person. If you don't like it, then don't say anything to me. I'm not at all slutty, but I'm in touch with my sexuality. I believe that as long as you're comfortable with your body and who you are, then that's a perfectly fine thing to be.  I'm probably one of the  most  open people you'll ever meet. So, looking at me, you might not think so, but I am. I've been through a lot, and you'll find all of it out eventually.  Anyways, I guess that's me in a nutshell. I guess I'll be writing a lot more later, so hope to hear from all of you .. peace xo ",3707278.200406210.female.16.txt

I don’t feel like she’s responded to my own issues well, and for some reason her method of reassuring me is to “move on, and get over it”. I’m not quite sure how I feel about that considering I would never say that to her.

It feels like so much time has gone by that any attempt at reconciliation would do more harm than anything else at this point. We used to have so much fun, but nostalgia only makes everyone feel worse, and more often than not leads to poor choices. It’s a sweet substance, like sugar, just with a punch in the gut to remind you that you can’t ever go back to something you once valued so highly. It’s been a year and a couple months since we’ve talked, and there’s rarely a day where you don’t cross my mind. I’m not saying that’s healthy, because it sure as hell isn’t, but who cares anyways. I wasn’t good for you, you were too good for me, we crashed and burned and I loved every second of it. Was it worth it? Maybe. Does that matter? Not in the slightest. Now I just sit alone in the dark writing you letters that I know you’ll never fuckin’ read, pretending in my head that there’s some fucking way that i can salvage the situation. It’s like watching someone stand at the bottom of the pool drowning, when all they have to do is swim to the surface. I’m cold, and tired, wasting time and throwing away opportunities left and right because i have no idea what I’m doing, and I know that you’re doing well, that makes me happy. You deserve to succeed. You’ve been to hell and back, and I might as well have been the chauffeur for a good portion of it. I loved you, I don’t think I do anymore, but I know I did. I thought about comparing how I felt about you with a bunch of shitty metaphors but let’s be honest, that isn’t our style. We’d probably laugh at how cheesy it was and how stupid this whole situation is and then we’d pull out our guitars and write a beautiful sad duet and I’d be out of tune while you hit every note perfectly. But you wouldn’t critique me, that’s just the way you are. Too kind, and sweet, too good to everyone you came across even though you knew there was a pretty good chance that they’d never return the favor. And man I really tried to, all those times we walked around talking about how much we wanted to die and how sad we were, but the whole thing was build on the back of our own loneliness and sadness. But that’s the past. Nostalgia is bullshit, but I have to indulge once in awhile just to feel something, I’m sure you remember that. Here’s to better times ahead, and a letter left unread.

1,"I've got to go watch my favorite television shows, so I'll be brief.    As a conservative, I'm more than a little fed up with the liberal bias in the media. Disgusted isn't really the right word-I'm disgusted with the blatant anti-Americanism of the flag-burning war protestors, I'm disgusted with the self-absorbed corruption at the UN-but the media bias...it can best be compared to a child singing an annoying song, incessantly, over and over again. They're AWARE that they're injecting bias into their news. They're AWARE that it's wrong. However, they're not going to stop doing it...because on one level, the annoying song-singing child enjoys singing the song, on another, it enjoys annoying the people around it. Eh, that's the best comparison I can come up with on such short notice.   Perusing the internet a couple of years back, I came across this wonder of wonders: THE BLOG. Conservatives around the nation had taken opportunity of this new miracle of technology to protest the liberal media. Good for them.   Since then, both the media and the celebrities around the nation have turned up the heat on their criticism of Bush, all the while proclaiming that there was a 'chill wind' of repression silencing them. Such sheer pretentiousness on their part served to give me a headache for a few hours, but nothing more.   However, they've begun to go to far. They've gone beyond the realm of 'bias' into the realm of 'propaganda.' I realized this after I was able to deconstruct the basis of a Time magazine article ('How we got Homeland Security wrong) with a calculator, access to google, and no more than five minutes of my own time. When something like this happens-when a trusted and widely read magazine starts putting out bullshit that can be disproved with eighth-grade research and math skills...well, things have gotten pretty bad.   Instead of sitting around and bitching about it, I've decided to throw my weight into the fight, by starting this blog. Whenever I can, I'll point out liberal media innaccuracies. Whenever I want to, I'll write opinion pieces.   However, unlike the mainstream media, I'll be honest with you. This Blog will be replete with right-wing bias, ranging from moderate to, as the media would put it, 'extreme.'   Thank you. ",3974221.200407190.male.17.txt

First of all, when I heard that this movie was coming out I picked up the book (not the misleading one with Will Smith on the cover).  I was fascinated by the book in the fact that it was a series of vignettes about the evolution of robots from mindless machines to a species equal to ours, all shown through the eyes of a robot pschoanalyst.  I thought these stories were amazing and saw a definite flow to all the unlinked stories.  This made me very intriqued about how the movie was going to be.     I had read that Alex Proyas was going to take liberties with the plot, but keep Isaac Asimov's vision intact.  I believe he failed, miserably.  What Mr Proyas made was just another unbelievable action movie that appeal to the dense overly stimulated action freak with none of the intended vision to what he speaks of.  It is sad really there was so much emotion and cerebral moments that were lots in the mindless CGI and laws of physics bending fight sequences that have been over used by ever movie since the first Matrix.  In fact they should have called this a Matrix prequal that George Lucas would have been proud of (including the apparently useless sidekick kid from Even Stevens that didn't have to do with anything in the story except a cheap laugh, can you say JAR-JAR).       There was some redeeming value, there was some witty dialogue that kept the plot interesting.  But of course, like all Will Smith movies, there was far too many pointless one-liners.   Another point was the fact that the leading lady wasn't just some no brain supermodel which was hard to believe that she actually could read the script (Denise Richards in The World is Not Enough), but they found some one less than perfect who was actually believable though still too young to be a brilliant scientist.       Overall the movie was entertaining, but not something that Asimov would have been proud to go see. ",3302427.200407190.male.26.txt
1,"How do I keep from being jealous of my very successful best friend? So, I've been die-hard friends with this girl for about 4 years. Our friendship has been through SO MUCH during that time: the death of her father, relationships and breakups, we've worked several jobs together and lived together. We jokingly call each other ""husband and wife""! She's an artist by practice and (through her inheritance) has the ability to not have to work a full time job and simply practice art. She's getting recognized internationally and is also just started as the creative director at a local female owned bar/art house. I am SUPER excited to see her doing all these things and I ALWAYS go to the openings of her events and show support when I can. I have traveled with her to art shows and helped set up her booth. Recently, I've had several bad dreams about her. In one dream, I was choking her and screaming in her face. In my dream last night, I was stalking her, trying to find out if she was ""cheating on me"". I think what I'm most jealous of is her freedom while I'm chained to a desk job all day. How do I address this so that I don't end up being resentful for her success! I feel like I'm being left behind. TL;DR I'm jealous of my successful friend and want to stop. ",lexafrex.txt

My biggest struggle is with my family, the only person that is there for me is my Step Dad... No one else seems to get it? My mum is always telling me to not keep secrets and that I should tell her how I feel coz if she doesn't know everything how can she help me? But I don't want to have to tell her everything (Because she says hurtful things back at me once I tell her and she won't even hug me) but if I don't tell her she makes me feel so bad and so I do tell her how I feel and then she shoots me down! She tells me to snap out of it and just get on with it and to stop being so stupid... every time I talk to my mum I cry coz she hurts me so much! And then she gets all down coz she makes me down which makes me down!!! I JUST CAN'T WIN! These days I only have to say something like ""oh that sucks, no milk"" and she tells me to get over it or get lost! And all I did was say something. I can't even really explain it? It's like she won't be happy until she hears what she wants to hear... I have tried talking to her about the way she makes me feel and all I get is ""that's just life"" or she starts telling me how she buys me things and that I should feel like this coz she has brought me things and let me use her car, etc, etc... The other day I was haven a really bad day and I asked mum for a hug and all she could say is ""No..."" she says she doesn't want to feed my sadness BUT instead of doing happy things she just tells me to get over it! And she won't listen when I say stop...She even told me to pack my bags and leave once if I didn't get over whatever it was I was going through! If I didn't have my step dad I wouldn't be here today... I love him more than the world and he is the only one that shows me that he loves me... I just need help...

1,"Shoudl I just stop being friends with this guy? I made a post on this subreddit a couple days ago. I thought that all my friends disliked me because I am mean to them, but for a solid 2-3 days I was the nicest I had been to anyone for what I remember, I asked all my friends how their days were, bought them food, listened to them. And it worked, they all are my very good friends now, but there is just one problem, the person who I considered my BEST friend is being a dick. Once I get attached to someone it’s hard for me to let go. For example, in my previous relationship, I hated my gf, and I hated being with her, talking to her, I found her annoying, I never broke up with her, then, one day she decidedI was neglecting her so she said she wanted to break up, I begged her to stay even though I hated everything about her. We still end up breaking up, afterwards I was soo happy. Now, this person who I considered to be my BEST friend makes fun of me all the time for getting dumped by a girl and saying “you got left by an ugly girl for a gay guy.” This sentence aline can tell you about his personality and how bad of a person he is. Today, my scho went to a ski park, I enjoyed my day, had fun, everythkng was fine. On the bus ride back to school, I was talking to my so called “best friend.” He randomly went up to a girl I didn’t know and told her I liked her, she then said “I don’t care.” I don’t know if this was a rejection or just a simple “I don’t care” but I didn’t really care because I didn’t find her attractive at all. I laugh it off and end up saying the word “nigga.” Now, I am what you would call a mulatto. I am bi-racial, half black, half white. After I said this word, a girl sitting behind me called me a racist. I then say that i’m half black and she says “I know.” This was embarrassing, I get made fun of a lot because of the tone of my skin and my ethnicity, it’s one if the things that still get to me. Moving on, he proceeds to point at me and laugh, then, scream at me saying I got rejected by the girl I didn’t even like or ask out. I stood up on the bus and accidentally touched a girl’s tit, she got very mad and I apologized but you could tell she was still mad. We get to school and he starts pushing me into doors and lockers, he is much bigger than me and I couldn’t really push him back easily. The day ends then we take the bus back home, me and this kid are on the same bus and he says, “you’re gross, nobody likes you and you got rejected by the ugliest girl in school. That’s why you got dumped by an ugly bitch.” And he walked away, as i’m walking home, I was talking to some friends and they treat me like a fucking human, they were nice, didn’t insult me, and treated me nicely. I got home and here I an, what should I do, he has managed to get the whole school to believe I am a perv, racist, ugly, nobody. It’s actually funny, he was the first person to ever talk to me, he was nice to me but after a while it just turned out he was a bad person, I wish one of the other guys were first to approach me, i’d have much better friends. What do I do, it’s one one of the hardest things to dispel gossip, everybody thought I was gay when I first came to the school, I got a girlfriend, suspicion gone, but how am I gunna disprove im not racist, not a perv, and how the hell am I supposed to deal with this “friend” if mine?

0,"Rolling down hill Hi all, It all started last year when I quit my bachelor in Physical Therapy. That study didnt seem right for me and I dropped out in feb 2016. From februari till september I've worked a depressing job in an order picking centre to pay for my next year of college. But after that there wasnt any motivation for anything left over in me. This year I started a new study, lifesciences. It started all fun for the first two months. Because we had the basics of chemistry, anatomy, algebra and physics. But in the beginning of november the second semester started and thus I had tests from the first semester. Failed them all. In the weeks leading to the tests I couldnt concentrate or motivate myself to do anything. I was just at my room doing absolutely nothing. 14 november was my birthday, turned 19. Everyone forgot it except my gf (for 2,5 years). Was a fun day and made me forget the test results and gave me a little hope. Today she told me she was seeing someone else for the last 3 months because I had too little time to see her, because I was always busy with school. Im feeling that everything is worse. My job sucks but I have to keep it as I got to keep up with school costs. Already got pretty hefty debt from those two halve years of university. I just feel that everything that I do fails. Like the last 2 years I've accomplished nothing. I would like to travel if I'm going to have my second gap year but my funds wouldnt allow it. Working would be my only option but the only jobs that are available will push me over the edge. But there is something good at the horizon; there is a small chance I'm getting accepted in to the police academy, but that's only a small chance so no big hopes as that makes it worse.

1,"My first post in this new journal that I've opened and am right now trying to think of something interesting to write. My name is not Catelina, but I've had friends think that it was, because I get referred to it very often. My sister calls me Catelina Marguerita, and once when I told a friend that and I commented that I was an alcoholic drink, they said ""delicious"". It gains some strange, perhaps unusual responses.  I am at university at the moment, studying a bachelor of science and am presently contemplating where it will take me. In no way, whatsoever, do I want to be a Scientist or a teacher. I am enamoured with the idea of becoming a doctor, and believe that the glasses which I got a week ago will aid me in my quest to take up this occupation. Yes, I do believe glasses make you smarter; it's a nice way to look at things, isn't it? But, seven years is an awful long wait to take up when you're craving in the most facist sense to be away from the world of studying.  I saw a pile of Medical lecture notes on sale at the university book store for $1.45, and was so utterly tempted to pick one up, pay for it, and go and sit in on the lectures. Then, when I finally get there, I will know most of the content and will breeze through the course... perhaps.  I have lived in the same house for all eighteen years of my life and my parents have been married for over 30 years, which in this day and age, is an achievement in itself, seeing as so many of my friend's parents are divorced, separated or estranged. I have a friend, who has moved so often in her life and craves to leave the place where she lives right now and for a time in our past, was so angry at me, I have come to realise, that I didn't want to go with her. But what people don't seem to understand is that living in the same house for so long, with parents who still love each other and siblings who are not on anti-depressents, is a remarkable, albeit maybe boring, life. I cannot think of a place I would rather be, even if I have only been on a plane once in my life and that was six months ago. ",4246116.200408160.female.17.txt
1,"This is kind of a wierd thing, having the opportunity to write about nothing in particular with no intended audience.  I'm not really sure if this is something I will do or not, but maybe I'll give it a whirl and see how it goes.  Basically, here's my story: I'm from a small town in southwestern Minnesota.  I grew up raising cattle and growing corn, wheat, and soybeans.  I had and still have both my parents as well as a brother and two sisters.  I was a smart kid in my high school and was always in the top of my class.  I never partied or got in trouble and was generally a good kid.     Then I went to college.   I went to NDSU in Fargo, ND in the fall of 1997.  There I learned to appreciate the sweet necture of life that was and is beer.  There I met some of my best friends and learned of the best mixes of all manners of alcohol.  We partied hard for 2 wonderful years.  Then, I got a letter from the dean.  I was asked not to come back to NDSU in the fall.  They figured that having 2 years to think about things, I'd be better off.     Well, what's a guy to do?     This guy decided he needed to get his head on straight.  I went out to work as a camp cook at a bible camp I had went to as a kid.  It was a rustic fort in the Black Hills of South Dakota with no electricity or running water.  All I had to cook with was a fire and a hand pump.  It was wonderful.  We'd shower only once a week, hike miles a day, and have lots of time just to commune with nature.     While I was out at the camp I talked with a friend who was changing schools.  The four-year schooling at a ""typical"" college was wearing on him and he needed something different.  He was joining up with a buddy that went to a Tech School for Fluid Power Technology (hydraulics and pneumatics primarily).  Well, I thought that sounded as good as any options I had so I signed up over the phone.  Never set foot in the building til the first day of class.  Turned out, that was one of the best decisions I ever made.   But, that's probably enough for now.  If anybody's even reading this, I'll fill some more in later.

I can remember being picked up at the park where I was playing to rush to the hospital where my sister had been getting tested. You could say I was whisked away from my innocence, but you're pretentious and I'm not. I can remember how my mother broke the news to me. And how her voice cracked a little when I asked how bad she had it. I can remember sitting in the front room of my grandparent's place, where I was staying so my parents could be with my sister in hospital, speaking to my cousin and saying that I felt it was somehow my fault. What followed was roughly a year of total disruption. My sister became the focus, understandably, while the rest of us learned to cope with the cloud hanging over us. Where a small rise in temperature could send hearts racing. But that has mostly been forgotten. Not blocked away, just forgotten. It was another age and doesn't feel real anymore. In the past few months the hospital has been doing a study of ex-patients and their families. Tonight it was my turn to do the phone interview. I'd been avoiding it, mostly because I'm lazy and I only ever seem to do things that I feel will be enjoyable to me. Anyway, so they called through and I spoke. I don't think there were really any surprises, although it was bizarre when I became conscious to the fact that I occurred to her getting cancer as it or that. I think I only said cancer once in the entire interview. Does that mean I'm crazy? Struggling to cope? I don't know.

0,"Hi, sorry if this turns into a lengthy post, but I could do with some advice, and I think this is probably the best place to ask. Firstly, I should point out, I am a 19 year male. My problem is that I am concerned by the physical effects the depression is having on me. I have probably been suffering from depression for several years, but I only sought medical help last November after I had a breakdown. The doctor has prescribed me with Fluoxetine, and I am taking 40mg per day. I originally started off on 20mg per day, but after I told the doctor what I will tell you now, about 2 months ago, he ""upgraded"" my status to severe depression, hence the increase in dosage. I can appreciate that my mindset is slightly biased towards feeling negative, and expecting the worst, but nevertheless I can't help but feel my symptoms might be the result of an even more serious problem. The medication has helped my mind (even though I still have plenty of lows, they aren't always as severe as they were 6 months ago), yet my physical health is deteriorating to the point where that's the main factor preventing me from accomplishing day to day tasks. My symptoms are as follows (and they may be generalized, I'll admit): Constant fatigue, even after plenty of rest; constant aching throughout the body; generally feeling very weak, lacking energy and strength, e.g. carrying shopping home can leave my arms in agony; loss of coordination, I have become very clumsy, always knocking glasses over, or dropping things for no reason; occasional loss of balance, usually when getting up, or starting to walk from a stand still; joints are feeling slightly stiff, they still move, but I can feel more resistance than normal and they get very tired very quick if was to use them, or even just hold my arms straight out in front of me; and for me, the worst symptom is an almost constant tremor in both hands and arms, which sometimes spreads throughout the body. If I attempt slow, fine movements with my hands, the tremor becomes very clear and results in jerky movements. Also, I like to exercise, yet after all exercises, even low intensity ones, the trembling seems to intensify. I doubt it is anxiety, as I still shake when I am calm, relaxed and immobile. I know I can't expect I diagnosis, but I would appreciate it if anyone can tell me if the severity of the physical effects I am experiencing, is quite common, even when the mental state is much more relaxed and beginning to recover? Thanks for any help ",Jameswolf_e_1_a_1_uk.txt
0,"Hi everyone. I am here because I am very depressed due to uncontrollable situations of extreme stress this year and a lifetime of stupid choices that have led me to where I am today: lonely and sad. I talked to my primary dr. and now have been taking Zoloft for almost 2 months. It seems to help some, I don't feel like I will panic to the point of losing control completely.

0,"Depression and grief I am a 28 yr old M, who has been diagnosed with treatment resistant MDD from the age of 16. Recently, I was attempting to get into a ketamine study in a NYC hospital and was asked a number of questions about my background. One item which came up that I have not thought about in a while was the specifics of my uncles suicide when I was around 13. My uncle was a 28 yr old gay M, developed HIV and killed himself. Though this is not what I was initially told. It took around 10 years with every year or so getting a new piece of information. Initially I was told he had cancer and died. Then I was told he had cancer and my grandparents ""pulled the plug"". Then I was told he was gay, had cancer, and my grandparents ""pulled the plug"". Then I was told he was gay, had HIV, and my grandparents ""pulled the plug"". Then, finally, I was told he was gay, had HIV and killed himself. I think I secretly had an understanding of how he had killed himself even when I was a kid and was not told due to subtle hints that kids will typically pick up on. Even if I did not, I always had the feeling that something was wrong and that my parents were not truthful. After discussing his death for two hours for the study, I realized that the depression I have been feeling for over 12 years is so similar to the feeling I get when I think of my uncle. Intense grief. I delved into the feeling more and have not been able to stop crying for the past few days about my uncle. Does this make sense from a psychological stand point to be greiving for this long? I know there is no time limit on emotions but does it make sense for my depression to be as a result of shoving down his death and holding onto it for all this time?

0,"Hi everyone, I'm new, and feeling kind of lost and shy. To introduce myself a little, I'm a 28 year old female. Up until about a year ago, I'd never had any problem with depression or any other mental illness, though all of the other women in my family have depressive tendencies. Suddenly, I started to feel differently in my mind - a feeling which has gone on getting worse and worse. The last four months in particular have been a downward spiral. I moved house from a big city to a small village late last year, and I'm not dealing with the change well. I don't know anyone in my local area, and I don't drive so I'm stuck in this little isolated world (I work from home). I lack the energy and the confidence to go out and meet new people. I tend to organize/run everything in our household so basic routines have just fallen apart, and my long-term relationship is under strain. My partner doesn't understand how I feel, while I resent the fact that he's making no effort to recognize the problem and take some action to help. My family and friends are 300 miles away, and I don't feel able to talk to them. This last week, I found out my Mum is having tests run for breast cancer. I know it's early days but it's just the last little thing that has pushed me over the edge. I am walking around either in a state of complete, grey numbness or in a state of unutterable misery, unable to react to anything in a rational way. I haven't left the house for days, because I hate the village where I live and being there just sends me into a blind panic attack. I've had an initial assessment for counseling in a city near where I live, but it'll be weeks before I can get an appointment. I know that I need to go and see a GP and get some medication, but I don't have the energy even to pick up the phone and talk to the receptionist, let alone to walk on my own through the horrible village. And I'm just so exhausted all the time. The internet's my only point of contact with the outside world at the moment. If all this sounds familiar to anyone, please reply - it would be a lifeline for me. Thanks Wizzy. ",d1zzyw1zzy_e_2_b_1_uk.txt

In November, I was at the bottom of a deep, dark pit, so called my psychiatrist, Barry. Surprising for me, I went back with a new, improved attitude. We'd had a couple of productive sessions when annual reviews came out. I called him for advice, and thought that while the advice he offered was good, that he was not being supportive at all. I actually thought about how to discuss with him how his response made me feel, rather than just shut him out. We had a couple of excellent sessions, which apparently told him that something had triggered defensive coping skills, and where my mind actually was.

Brooms I could never control, and potions I never could suceed. I was not very smart, until I had a inspiration. Ronald Weasley, thats who. He was nothing then, but I knew that he was to be the future Samurai. I studied harder than ever, and was ridiculed by my brothers more than ever before, and I dared not to tell them my plans. My brothers spited me, or should I say my half brothers. I had in all, 2 brothers, all older. Kenji and Kenshin were at large, and the two Samurais, not to mention. I am just a mage, a fire mage. Fire mages were not fun to be because they have bright firey colored hair. This, I have, But the hot temper I do not have.

I studied hard and got stronger. You may not yet know my plans but here they are: I will become Riley's master so he will gain respect for the lost brother of the Samurais. This was my plan, well, the base of it. In my mind (and in millions of folders and disks) I went through the plan over and over again. It was completely full proof by the time Riley was born, but yet I kept gaining more and more knowledge of things around me and got stronger and stronger, but I did not change the way I looked, I did not want to scare the kid like I know Kenshin and Kenji would do.

In real life i had basically no friends. She was the only friend I had. I'm sure this led me to having unhealthy views on relationships. I still have unhealthy habits and feelings towards relationships. Anyways, the trouble began when on instagram, our main chatting platform, she began to gain friends from just common interests and such. She started posting screenshots of her friends and her dm conversations and how funny they were. She then would post screenshots of her group chat conversations and how funny they were. All of this would happen, and I would still be waiting for a simple reply. I didn't get it. I still don't really get it. I was there for her for so long.

She also made a whole separate account where she would post as well which she never even told me about and I had to find out myself when she spoke about it on her main account. I finally had enough and sent her a long explanation about my feelings and stuff and didn't speak to her after that. And the funny thing is that she didn't reply to my explanation for two weeks. And suddenly she was like "":( nooo pls :(("" etc Typing all of this, I lowkey am getting annoyed.. I just want someone to smack some sense into me. Like it's been so long and I still think about her. It wasn't like she was a bad friend, but she just fuckin ignored me and basically left me. I usually think about her when I'm feeling lonely or my irl best friend starts to treat me like shit and ignores me.. but that's a different story... Right now, I'm thinking about dming her and just having small talk. I feel like it's a bad idea, but also it could reunite us and we could be friends again? It's probably a bad idea and I probably won't do it though.. Please give me words of wisdom. ",badtofuu.txt
1,"The day started like any normal day. Spent quality time with cow shit in the morning and then came home. But when I came home, I had the pleasure of trying to inform the soccer team of our game in De Pere that evening. That was an adventure. Called 10 people, left messages by all but 3. We ended up cancelling it anyway, thank God. So instead I went in my yard and kicked a ball around for a while just to pass the time because the Brewers are in the midst of a horrendous offense stretch. I actually caught Adult Swim tonight. Family Guy, Futurama, and Aqua Teen Hunger Force were all of good quality. So until something interesting happens, everyone who reads this will be forced to be as bored as me.

Shadow them . which meant we would have to observe them going about doing their job. this whole exercise was to be completed in a span of 7 hours and also required us not to spend any money on any form of hired aomutation , which would now mean that we would have to go about the entire city (which means many corporates)..Hitch hiking.  with initial few hitches we all ultimately were off to our vaguely targetted destinations. i chose to go to the office of the Daimler Chrystler india situated at the farthest end off the city.i managed to reach the destination by hitch hiking  snd managing some how.aafrom then it was smooth sailing as i have my brother in law working with D.C.

1,"Should I have kids? Here’s why I’m asking: My mother has an undiagnosed mental illness, of that I am certain. My best guess is either bipolar or borderline personality disorder. Growing up with her was difficult and she never got the help she needed. My brother and I suffered greatly as a result. The scariest thing is when I occasionally find, or think I find, her mental illness in myself.. certain tendencies to obsess, feel abandonment that isn’t real and lashing out because of it, etc. When that happens I just feel so disgusting and shameful. In those moments I wish that she wasn’t my mom and that I wasn’t her son, or that I could permanently swap heads with someone else. I think about all this as my fiancé and I talk about having kids. Both of us are ready and we want to be parents so very badly, though I haven’t brought up my fears to her. I worry often about passing on that illness to our children. My fiancé doesn’t deserve that, she shouldn’t have to face those hard challenges. I love her so much and the thought of doing that to her kills me inside. I feel so much shame around wanting to be a parent because of this that I wonder if I should be one at all, or rather, a biological one.  It’s something I’ve never really thought about before now and I don’t know what to do. Please help ",Ocnarff.txt

1,"Fucked up Families- Mamas From Hell We all got that fucked up incident in our families, right? Well, Imma vent about mine, cause it real fucked. For me at least, right, so am a naive virgin eighteen year old, wanna yknow experience sex and dig a guy and stuff, so I go on the dating apps and meet a lad, real nice too, sweet and that, I obviously am attracted to him. So we date and do all the couple stuff like movies and sex and I am on cloud nine cause he an older man so like am cool at school (super super shallow and lame but yknow, naive virgin eighteen year old trying to live up to social pressures exerted by my peers). Anyway, I like the dude, and we fall for each other, we married now with kids so we chill. Right, so a month or two in, he gets all funny on a night out and makes us go somewhere quiet away from our mates, which I dont catch onto cos yknow am like shitfaced and cant feel my face so I dont realise nothing is up at all. Right so he says to me, I shagged a girl before you and am like dude thats not a surprise yknow you told me you had women before me. That shit fair enough cause hes older and yknow its normal for partners to experiment before settling for one. And he goes well I like you, a lot, and I dont want this girl to ruin shit and am like, well I dont see how you arent still shagging her are you? he isnt still shagging her right, so yknow good boy, however, he shagged her before me, like six months before me and yknow what can happen in six months? A goddamn baby can grow in the mofo womb during that time. Hes pissed, he was like I told her it was a shag, she agreed, told me she was on the pill and it mustve glitched that month (as the story always goes) and she got preggaz. I told her to terminate (dude this is a condensed version of the story, there was emotion and shit behind it, so dont go all prolife on me, it's just a minor detail im trying get out there and passed so I can tell the rest of the story). Right, so she starts kicking off saying hes emotionally black mailing her into an abortion and talking about a baby she lost as a teen and shit and am like, okay so just back off. He did, and she came back a few months later like lol theres another guy, not sure if hes the dad or not, I think its you tho. Like, good, thanks bitch, a think its you is all the proof I need. So she sends him laods of scans and basically pretends hes her baby daddy. Annoyed me a bit cos yknow i was a teen wanting to mess round and just yknow settle with this guy and this chick is trying to like worm her way in. She makes friends with his sister on fb (weird cos he doesnt have contact with any of his family, hasnt for like four years prior that) and starts getting pally with his mum dad brothers, all of them. Tells them I was his mistress and they were a couple, they decided to have a baby, and when she got pregnant he started messing round with me, a teenage girl. Fews holes in that story but well skip ahead, and the baby is born. They get this dodgy dna that says its not admissable in court due to infrequencies or something and that close relatives (she was shagging his brother at the time too) could skewer results. Basically the baby daddy could be his bro but itll come back his cause its a shit dna. Anyway it came back the baby was his and he suddenly goes all fatherly. Doesnt see the kid for like six months then starts visits and pays maintance. Meanwhile, shes fucking round going to his family and bitching about how horrible I am being a homewrecker and all that eventho they were a shag and got with him six months after her. He wont get another dna cause he was like paid for one not doing another, and I explained the issues but he wont. ALl our children look identical, the kid has blond hair and blue eyes, me and my partner are both dark and so are our kids, (the girl in question also is dark so where the fuck blond blue eyes came from is beyond me). For months after she kept ringing me saying omg you need to put him on the phone the babys sick and he needs to visit, and if you ignore it shed up it and be like an ambulance is coming now omg its serious (it never was). The kid was in hospital like twenty times in his first week of life, each time let out with nothing serious wrong, altho she exaggurated and made out he was on the brink of death. Tries to get him to take her kids out while Im in mofo labour, giving birth and shes kicking off on the phone saying hes not spending enough time with them. Once I gave birth comes round screaming and shouting how hes off the birth certificate, how shes changing the kids name and how shes taking him to court for more money yhadda yhadda yhadda.

1,"Cousin I’ve not seen for 25+ years trash talking me to my son (sorry long post) I just need a rant and maybe some advice on what to tell my son. My youngest son (15) came home last night and said he was invited to a party this weekend and could he go, after all the ‘mum checks’ I gave permission. He then proceeded to tell me that the mum of his friend ‘hates me and that I hate her’ and I found this odd as I don’t particularly hate anyone and certainly not one of his acquaintances mums. It turns out that she is a cousin of mine who I haven’t seen for 25+ years since the death of our grandfather, her father accused me of stealing my grandads Home and contents, not true but I did care for my grandfather at his home, that I bought, and my grandfather lived rent (and bill) free for 2 years prior to his death. When he passed away, my uncle said he wanted things from the home for himself (I had no issue with that) and when my uncle (this lady’s dad) said he wanted the TV I said he could take the rent book for it too (my grandad rented it from a local place). My uncle was pissed but accepted that it was rented. I also put into boxes all the things my grandad had willed my aunts and uncles for them to take away after the funeral - some couldn’t bear to and I put it in storage for them to take at a later date. Now I’ve lived in my home since then and over the years changed the house to my taste and extended it. Unbeknownst to myself (until last night) each time I changed something my uncle has bad mouthed me to other family members and run me down, convincing others that I stole the house from them (was a rental property when my grandfather moved in and it was myself who purchased it). Over the years I have noticed that my family are not very communicative with me but I’ve put it down to initially my brothers death (4 years after my grandad) and then my mums (a few years later). But after speaking to others in the family last night I’ve discovered what has been said about me. Now I don’t particularly give a damn about what’s said about me but I am upset that my cousin has told my son that I hate her, he is autistic and things like this stick in his head. Last night I just said something like ‘I don’t know the lady how can I hate her? And is that something you think I would do?’ To which he agreed that it wasn’t something I’d say/do. My problem is the party, the parents are going to be there (one of the reasons I’m allowing him to go) and I’m concerned that they will trash talk me to him and how do I explain to him that some people just believe what they want regardless of what the truth is? I don’t want to give him all this information before he goes as it’s not really a problem unless my cousin makes it one, of you see what I mean. Thank you if you made it this far and any advice would be appreciated. ",smilerlollie.txt

1,"Friend slipping up at work. I talked to her and now she’s creating a bad environment for me. I’ll call my ex friend Mary.  We met at work.  I really valued our friendship because it’s hard for me to make friends.  I had a few hurt me in the past, so I became guarded.  Plus, I had to leave behind true ones when I moved away from my hometown 3 years ago.  About a year and a half ago, she started dating a new guy.  They seemed to have an ok relationship.  After a year of dating, they started having problems.  Mary spent every lunch hour complaining about him the entire time.  She stopped asking me how I was, always steering the conversation toward her bf.  I tried to be there for her, hugging her and reassuring her she’ll be ok.  She would be like, yeah I know but...then continue complaining about him.  She admitted to nagging him, and he eventually got sick of it and broke up with her.  She was a mess, crying at work, sometimes not even coming in.  I felt bad for her but it was the same thing over and over all the time, and I ran out of stuff to say.  Not to be offensive toward women (I am one, after all), but being the environment it is, word about Mary’s breakup traveled fast, and all our coworkers went up to Mary to comfort her. She leaned heavily on four of them, who often came up to her desk and asked if she wanted to talk.  Mary stopped hanging out with me and started spending a lot of time with them.  Mary would say yes when they offered to talk to her at work and they’d talk for like a half hour or longer (my desk is next to hers, so that’s how I knew).  I would also see Mary huddled in the hallways talking to these women a lot.  It affected Mary’s work.  She started taking on less work (claiming she was overwhelmed) and not being around (she would go off to find one of the women), so the rest of us would be left to answer her calls or speak to her clients on her behalf.  Our boss is very hands off and is a poor manager so he has no idea, and my coworkers just excuse Mary because they feel bad for her and don’t wanna tell our boss.  But because she and I handle certain cases that only she and I know how to deal with, it’s usually me who’s left to pick up the extra slack.  This went on for 3 months.  Honestly, if she wasn’t a friend, I might gone to our boss, but I decided to talk to Mary about it.  It didn’t go well. She got defensive, denied that she was slipping up, and accused me of being a bad friend cuz I wasn’t there for her during this difficult time.  I tried to point out examples of her slipping up and she denied it again.  I also told her she wasn’t there for me when my friend committed suicide or my dad had a health scare which left him disabled.  She just responded that she was left in so much despair from the breakup that she wasn’t capable of being unselfish enough to be a friend.  We both walked away mad.  She started ignoring me completely.  I didn’t think I was wrong but I still felt bad.  As this was around Christmas time, I decided to extend an olive branch by giving her a small Christmas gift and card that just said I was sorry and I hoped she had a merry Christmas.  The next day, she said thanks and we’d talk soon.  The day after that, she was back to ignoring me.  Now she doesn’t speak to me or even look at me, just pretends I’m not there.  I can’t say for sure, but I get the feeling that she told our coworkers about our conversation (I haven’t told anyone at work about it) cuz I now get the cold shoulder from some of them, too, when just the day before, we were all ok.  They, in front of me, make a show of hugging Mary and offer food to each other but not to me.  I even got a dirty look from one of the women, too.  Sigh, I don’t know what to do.  Any advice?

0,"Well, I'm a sixteen year old girl, and my name is to be unknown, so just call me Kat. I think I have depression, and others have told me that I may, because I have mood swings, I constantly think of death / suicide, and I do cut myself, a lot. When I'm sad I will cry and I will throw up sometimes on purpose. I have issues with the way I look, because I am overweight, and I am insecure about my weight. I have moments where I break down at school in the girls' bathroom and I do carry a razor blade around with me and I will cut myself at school. I have scars everywhere on my arms and some on my legs, and the scars do overlap each other. I have a friend who I like to talk to, and sometimes it helps. I have tried to talk to other friends, but they don't care. So yeah, my parents know I cut, and they're also thinking about getting a divorce and taking me away from the school I love.. I don't know if anyone here cares. Or if anyone here thinks I'm just another fake teen crying for attention .. but I don't care, this is what's with me, and it does hurt..

0,"I've been dealing with severe depression for sometime now, and within recent weeks it has hit its worst (most of my posts were in the MNSEN area): lack of sleep, stress, behind on my work, can't leave my apartment, constant crying, hopeless need, etc. And during these few weeks I have taken the steps into getting into regular therapy again by consulting psych services at my school in conjunction with the counseling I get (or hardly ever get) from my hospital. The severity of my depression has been taking a toll on my friends and last night it seemed to reach its pinnacle. I'm not sure what came over me, I wasn't even drunk, but I started lashing out at a friend of a friend that was at the same party as I was. I started to verbally bully and attack him because he ""annoyed"" me, I don't know why I have so much pent up anger. It rapidly went out of control and before I know it my friends were holding me back and I violently threatened them. For the first time in my life, my best friend (closest friend) had to physically hold me against a wall, almost hitting me, to get me to come down. I just broke down after that, it wasn't even about that stupid guy anymore. I was suddenly overcome with loneliness and fear an jealousy and embarrassment. I've always been known for a very short temper, and my friends all know me to be very emotional, but I have never gotten so violent; I've hit and thrown objects before in anger and frustration but I've never struck someone. Though they all tried to console me that night, I feel even farther away from the few friends that I do have. Everything was hazy from last night, even though I had hardly any to drink... it wasn't so much of an intoxication, but more like a violent breakdown of sorts. I was so angry and I was desperate to physically hurt someone; it was quite a scene since I'm a petite girl starting a fight with a passive aggressive 6 ft male--some laughed it off at first as a Napoleon Complex, but it became serious when they saw how out of it I was. I just remember being so hurt and angry at my friends; I felt so alienated which fueled my anger at the world, at my life more... (As cliche as that sounds). And today I just don't feel like going out and I can't help but feel so alone. The way my friend violently had to restrain me scared me a lot---I've never seen her like that, and she is certainly not the type to behave like that... I pushed her to that point. It brought me back to an ex-bf of mine that I was very close too and who saw the worst of my depression as well; he too at one point had to restrain me violently (against his character as well). After an off and on relationship of trying to stay together, he couldn't take me, or my emotional instability, anymore. Last night, I had friends breaking down screaming at me that they were never enough for me (to make me happy or content otherwise) and it just brought me back to that moment with my ex. I feel as if that this cycle is in all my relationships--romantic ones and friendships. I seem to constantly push people away. I don't know what to do. I don't miss my ex-bf at all, but I'm scared that I will never be able to have close relationships/friendships. Everyone I know just pities me. I feel so completely alone and pathetic.

They're in the ""lovey dovey"" phase right now, and they really want to consummate their relationship, i think they should wait until they're 18, but it's their choice to make. Anyway, my conflict is this. They want to have sex, but they have nowhere to do it at. They're too poor for a hotel, and both their parents watch them like hawks whenever they're together. Plus, she gets taken too and from school, and her parents chaperone her everywhere else, since she doesn't have a car yet (they are making her work for her vehicle). As for him, his dad never leaves the house, and he has an ""open door"" rule, meaning they have to be where they can be seen and all doors open at all times at his house. The only time her parents aren't watching her is when she's with me, we hang out a lot on the weekend, so they let her spend the night at my house often, because of my situation on the weekends. On the weekends, my mother works late evening/nights, and she's gone until almost 6 in the morning.

1,"Having to share a small living space with Grandpa My grandpa and I are having trouble adjusting to our new living situation, and I was wondering if anyone had any ideas to help us in this predicament. Backstory: I never really saw eye to eye with him while growing up. He was quite the wild prankster, and his antics often left me humiliated and embarrassed. Back in my boyhood of 1991, he pantsed me while I performed at the school talent show. He routinely mentions this while at family gatherings, and it has subsequently caused me extreme grief. This trend of surprise humiliation lasted for two decades. Just when I thought me and gramps were cool again, I'd feel my pants hit the ground. He's  deprived me of my sanity, as well as given me an extreme fear of public speaking scenarios. I ended up forcing him to go to family counseling with me, and he denied the whole thing. After turning in historical footage (my mom always cam-corded my recitals or graduation ceremonies), he finally gave in and admitted to his rude behavior. It took a couple dozen sessions, ending with a mock-talent-show, where I played my trumpet for the therapist. Gramps just sat there, cool as ice. With arms folded, he nodded to me - and that's where things changed. Anyhow, I had an extra ticket to go see Teagan and Sara - so I got ol' gramps on the phone. He kinda razzed me for listening to such feminine sounding music, but eventually accepted my invitation. I picked him up and brought him to the venue. The ticket office said there was a mixup, and that we'd get front-row seats. This was my lucky day, as well as a great way to finally bond with the old codger. It took a couple of songs, but he really got into it. He was so exuberant, jumping up and down on his seat. He pulled me up, and I did the same. After the first half of the set wrapped up, the sisters on stage looked down at gramps and I. They asked us if we were having a good time, and also the nature of our relation. A stage hand passed down a microphone to gramps. ""I'm here with my grandson!"" There was this big 'awwww' that came from the crowd. They asked us how long he'd been a fan, and he mentioned the fact that I would sometimes play their songs on my trumpet. To my amazement, they pulled me and gramps on stage for the next song. They got me a trumpet and instructed me to play a solo to ""I was a fool"" - It was literally one of the best moments of my life. I was on stage with my favorite sister duet band. Right as I put the brass mouthpiece to my lips, I felt those wrinkly little fingers jutting into my belt loops. I tried to stop him, but my pants hit the ground before I could react. I wanted to die in that moment. Security ended up escorting us out of the venue, where a police officer was waiting for us. Now we're both cell mates for the next year. We got caught in some type of legal double-whammy. He, being the pantser, was ruled guilty for sexual assault. Me, the pants-ee, was convicted of exposure and indecency. Both of us will have to register as sex offenders once we're out of the clink. Anyhow - I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on how we could pass the time together? Any board games or things like that? We have a whole year of time to kill, and it really took being cellmates for me to understand exactly how generation gapped we are. Anyhow, your advice is greatly appreciated. I gotta hide this phone, but I'll check for your replies later tonight. Thanks! ",TapoutKing666.txt

It provides release, but also accountability.  In a way, this log is a letter to my future self; a reminder; a chronicalling.    Taylor and I have broken up more times in the past 9 years than I can even begin to count, and in recent years those endings have been becoming more and more final, as we sought other loves and different paths.  But we always seemed to find our way back to each other again.   This time there is a sense of finality.  Despite our best efforts, we just can't seem to move beyond our struggles.  It is heartbreaking to think of leaving behind my best friend and all of the dreams we shared for our future, but it is also exciting to think of the possibilities life has in store for us.    I take solace in the small things...  Puddle jumping on my way to the corner market this morning Birds enjoying all of their new baths after the rains last night Kids in a single file line on their way to a field trip  I am seeking new adventures: meeting new people, exploring new places, new things.... Letting in and  taking in   the world with a new perspective, a lightness, an openess.   The past 3 years have brought a lot of loss and lessons.  I have had to mourn my grandparents for the second time as the dome was sold.  I had to let go of Taylor to be with Mark, who brought a lot of joy, but even more heartache, and then regret that I had hurt Taylor to pursue such a fruitless endeavor.   I have always tried to follow my heart at any given moment, and sometimes the choices that follow are painstakingly difficult.  I can't help but feel that some of those choices have contributed to these insurmountable trials between Taylor and I.  He moved on long ago.    And now I must begin to.    I have learned so much in the last few years; about love and life, and mostly about myself.   I live my life with the faith that everything happens just as it is meant to. I must trust the unfolding, let go, and let in. ",3608331.200406110.female.27.txt

1,"(New York) Who's in the wrong here? I'm a little upset over a disagreement with one of my best friends that occurred in late August and has resulted in us not speaking or hanging out since. We're in college and we were out together at a party. We were talking to some random guys, and I left because I saw my ex and was talking to him. My friend texted me asking where I was and I told her I was talking to him. She told me to go to her and I said okay, and asked if he could come. Then she just said i'll just go home see you later. I was like, no don't leave alone I'll come with you without him. But she kept refusing my offer and ignored my calls when i tried to find her. When she got home she complained to my other friend that I ditched her and made her walk home alone, when I offered to go to her and tried to get to her before she left. Since then she said she was taking time for herself whatever that means and literally hasn't contacted me since. I have tried apologizing numerous times and being normal but she isn't really having any of it, and says she isn't mad at me. We haven't spoken in around 2 months now and I'm really upset because I didn't feel like I did anything wrong for one of my best friends to hold some sort of weird grudge and I miss her.

1,"Classmate/ bullying problems I have a classmate who constantly bullies our other classmates. Seems like she feels as if she is superior, the leader of our whole class and everyone has to follow and do what she says. If someone is late to the meetings she is harassing them. She is being very rude and insulting. Her voice is always extremely loud, and if she has a problem with people she always shouts it to the class instead of approaching the person and discussing it with them like a normal person would do. For example, she was upset with a group of her classmates because they didnt want to follow whatever she says, and she heard that they might have said something bad about her, but instead of approaching them to ask them about it, if its true or whatsoever, everytime we have meetings she will just talk extra loud and will let our whole class listen to her nonsense comments like she keeps on talking about ""fake people"", as if she wanted the group who said something about her to hear it and feel guilty. I dont get why she does it and why she is the way she is. Does anyone have an idea? And what should we do about it? It's getting annoying and I know already if we would approach and talk to her she would put the blame on everyone else and just be more mad and find stupid excuses. Does anyone have any advice?

0,"Is it stress, depression or burn out? Hey, I’m a diabetic 1 with Autism. For the past 3 years i have felt constant fatigue, no motivation, sleep issues, stomach problems, bad memory and concentration issues. I took antidepressants Cymbalta 60 mg before this during 8 months for major stress and it helped me with almost no side effects. But after i quit antidepressants Cymbalta 60 mg ,the fatigue, no motivation, sleep issues, stomach problems and concentration issues has been persistent in my life. Now for 3 years. No matter how much rest i get i feel tired. Even if excercise, eat healthy, do yoga and meditation. My blood sugar levels has been up and down lately. But even if they are controlled i feel the same. A cause could be that i have worked on a lot of projects during the past 3 years. It went as far as that i started to get suicide thoughts. I do not feel any ups or downs in my life. Things i used to like to do isles enjoyable. I rather stay at home than being social. I believe i have major depression and i have visited psychologist and psychiatrist who have advised me to take antidepressants. But the question is if I’m stressed, have major depression or simply burnt out. I certainly feel that i have a huge major depression. My OCD thought are back and i have been stuck on testing my blood sugar 10-15 times per day during the past year. Which also could bring my stress levels up. The past year has been very stressful for me work wise. But even if i get a weekend of rest i don’t feel rested. I have been to different psychiatrists and psychologist and the conclusion is either major depression or burn out. I barely have the energy to clean my apartment anymore, wash my clothes or think about my hygiene. I feel tearful occasionally on some days. I have thought about taking antidepressants again, particularly Cymbalta since it worked for me the first time. But i have been afraid of taking them. Instead my psychiatrist described me brintellix (Vortioxetine), 10 mg per day for my depression. But the question is, i’m i stressed, depressed or burnt out? Anyone have been in a similar case? Any experiences of the antidepressants brintellix (Vortioxetine) for major depression? I’m so afraid of starting to take them, but i don’t want to feel this way of every morning waking up with no motivation for anything that the day brings me. ",gomezhouse.txt

1,"Ending a friendship - am I overreacting? I'm looking for advice from impartial people. To give a little background information, I recently went through a nasty split with my fiance of several years. My relationship with him, up until the dividing issue, was solid. I have just discovered that my best friend spent many months telling my coworkers that my relationship was illegitimate, that I was only dating him because I pitied him for his looks, and that my fiance and I were really just platonic friends but that I agreed to get married out of desperation. (To be clear, none of this is true - although others do find him to be unattractive in a conventional sense, I did not. She was projecting.) As a result, as I have now learned, my LEGITIMATE relationship became a workplace joke, and everyone has been mocking me and my fiance behind our backs for a year, including my bosses. This also includes people who I excitedly called after getting engaged and people that I had offered positions in my wedding party to. To make things worse, the fact that the relationship ended is being blamed on me being shallow about his appearance and is being used as vindication for these rumors. Not that it matters, but it ended for a plethora of deeply ingrained and painful issues, none of which were in any way related to appearance. I feel so betrayed by this friend that I can't imagine ever reconciling. I am preparing to completely cut her from my life and just want to know if others would do the same, or if I'm overreacting to average workplace drama. ",ChaseIsWhoIWant.txt

1,"OK. I've been wanting to blog for awhile. Thing is I can't decide how honest I want to be in it. What if someone in the family found it? Guess I'll just have to take that chance. So anyway, what I really wanted to write about is Shana. I hate talking to anyone in the family about her because I don't want to upset them. I mean, what if they're having a good day? Then I pour out all of my stuff and make them start grieving again. Although I know, realistically, that we'll never stop grieving. I still cannot believe that she killed herself. Immediately after, that week, sometimes someone would say it must have been an accident. But come on, Shana was brilliant. She knew how little she was. Taking a bottle of anti-depressants and pain pills was not an accident. She wanted to leave. She wanted the pain to stop. That's why she took them at bedtime.  I still hear my brother describing how he found her. Right after we got to the house he told us everything. Took us up to Shana's room and showed us her bed. Showed us where he carried her to the top of stairs and tried CPR. Told us the police had to pry her out of his arms. Told us she was already getting stiff. And she was cold, he said, so cold. Sometimes I can't stop hearing the stuff from that week. I can hear him crying my name.  I remember so much from that week. Picking out the fingernail polish, helping Grandma iron her clothes. Previewing her hair and makeup with my sisters. We took a picture for reference. My sister was so tough. I couldn't see the details through the tears but J did.  Even writing in my journal I feel like I need to edit stuff out. But I can't. It's time to get this stuff out. Shana's been gone for over a year and I still don't really believe it. She was only 19 and had so much to live for. I'll never stop wondering why.  Her suicide note was in her live journal. Titled ""Enough is Enough"". That's it. I'm done. I love you all... The same message, or maybe a little longer, was set up as an 'away' message in outlook. I never could bring myself to email her so I'd get it back as a reply. I asked my sister if she'd made up an album of Shana stuff. She said she thought the pictures belonged interspersed with other family pictures. I don't know though.

0,"I've been in a constant rush to try and get on my feet for the last three years, but I always end up doing nothing about it. I've forgotten what motivation is all about. Hey there, I just turned 22. And this is my situation: About three years ago, I used to feel excited about everything. Finishing school, starting my studies at a university, being self-sufficient, finally doing what I thought was my future career. I'm not sure what happened, but I started losing my drive. Things didn't look as exciting, nor entertaining. Never having even kissed a girl, I felt alone and loveless. Still, I felt motivated enough to start working on my social skills, met a few people over the Internet, even got a girlfriend. (Thanks to the Internet I have a social life, as ironic as that sounds, even though it's not that good). Fast forward to this year, I was able to date a couple more girls, had a good time but they all ended too soon. I've never been able to have sex with the girls I've been with because I lost my sex drive in the course of these last years. Also the extremely low self esteem and self hatred don't help. Today, I find myself unable to even have a conversation with someone, mostly girls. I can't come up with anything to talk about and I feel like all the things I learned about social skills have gone away suddenly. How do people have such natural conversations with one another? How did I manage to do it before? I feel like I want new friends, I want to have a good time, but can't figure out where to go, or what to do to achieve that. Regarding my studies, this year was a slow one. In the time I should have completed 50% of my career, I only completed around 20%. I started visiting a psychologist because I can't get myself to study for my exams (I'm not cooperating much with him), and all I do is worry about it though I never take up the responsibility. I am fully aware of the fact that things don't come if you just sit and wait, but I can't bring myself to do anything other than complain. Meanwhile I feel like my mind wants to run, but doesn't know which way to go, and my body won't budge. I think 24/7 about how I'm getting older, and I'm wasting every second of my life. I'm completely lost and feel like everything I do is going nowhere. And I don't even know how to end this post, just wanted to put this somewhere and hopefully get some solutions or words of encouragement from people who've been through the same.

1,"Should I reach out to her or leave it alone? (TL;DR) I had a friend and it ended pretty bad IMO. I’ve really missed her over the past couple years and I thought about re-befriending her but I’m not sure. I’ll start with the good things about our past friendship: -she was pretty sweet to me. Very supportive of most things. -She stood up for me when like half the school picked on me for having a 2 foot bright orange Mohawk. -She tried to keep me from dating a pretty Toxic boy (but at the time I was young and wouldn’t listen) -She made me walk around the entire town with her frequently (helped me lose the weight I’d gained and build some muscle in my legs) -She was for the most part a great friend Now the bad: -since I didn’t listen about Toxic boy, we ended up dating for about 4 years. He’s said he didn’t like her cause when they went to school together she flirted with him and when he kissed her in the hallway she told the school he sexually assaulted her and got him sent to juvie. Now while I’m not gonna go into the semantics of whether or not it was s. Assault in anyway, I will say she fully apologized to him and me for it a while back but he made me tell her that we didn’t accept her apology and to “fuck off” -She borrowed a couple box sets of shows from me around this time, those sets were given to me by favorite aunt when I was young. When I wanted them back she claimed she couldn’t find them. Almost a year went by of her “looking” for them, and I told her (mostly from Toxic boy pushing me to) if she didn’t find them by the end of the week I was going to call the police and report her for stealing them. She gave them back to me a couple days later (scratched, though I don’t know if she knew they were scratched) -I also shortly dated, and quickly broke up with one of her brothers last year (our personalities didn’t really mix well) but I don’t think she holds it against me The manority of us breaking up was due to Toxic Boy (he’s he was toxic, he tried to fuck literally any girl friend I introduced him to) pushing me into breaking up with her, telling me she was the toxic one cause she didn’t support our relationship and cause of the juvie thing from years before. In 2015 she reached out to me on Facebook saying: “Hey i know your probably the last person you wanna hear from but, i just wanted to say im sorry for all the bullshit that happened when i was still in school. If you don't wanna be friends thats understandable, just know thats not me anymore, and im sorry” Which, of course, Toxic boy made me to reply incredibly rudely to and our friend ship just kind of died. So I need a second, strangers, opinion. What do I do? *TL;DR: Toxic (now ex) boyfriend made me ditch abrasive friend, do I rekindle friendship?* ",Socialmutation.txt
0,"Ok I have a couple of questions...I guess. 1st is I finally managed to make myself an appointment with a psychiatrist (it's not till May). Now I'm having second thoughts about it. I just pretty much want to go in for an evaluation (to see if there is a problem) and see if maybe there is a short term solution for the suicidal thoughts I've been having. I've got a summer job I'm leaving for in June and than I'm moving to another city after that. (So basically something till I'm stable with where I'm living and job). I assume I'm only going to be able to see 1 doctor, 1 time before than. So 2nd thoughts have been should I just wait to see someone when I actually get settled. Also if a psychiatrist is who I want to see (I've never been to anyone before for my mental health)...that's what the intake coordinator suggested. Also I was wondering if they could hospitalize you for suicidal thoughts without your permission? Ok now on to the suicidal thoughts questions (and just so people know I do not feel myself to be in any immediate or near immediate danger to myself). One main thing is does depression have to be present for suicidal thoughts/actions? I often find my mind turns more to thoughts of suicide and death when I feel relatively normal mood wise. And that when I have feel really depressed the thought of suicide rarely crosses my mind (but the pain is more severe). I guess that's really all I have. Sorry if the topic is inappropriate for this forum. I just wanted to ask...and maybe discuss with someone...but don't really feel that it's a problem for me right now. If someone wants to talk in PMs I wouldn't mind either. ",twilightzephyr_e_2_a_1_xx.txt
0,"I'm 15 and have been depressed for about a year. i got over it for a little while but now i am back to all the pain. I cut myself for the first time a couple weeks ago and now i can't stop. I always reach for my knife when I'm alone and hurting. One of my major problems is that I'm really good at hiding my feelings. No one knows that I'm depressed and no one except my best friend knew that i cut myself. I told my best friend because we tell each other everything when I told her the only thing she could say was ""you're Crazy"" Not exactly the reaction i was expecting especially since she once told me that she cut herself because we got into a huge fight. And even though I knew she was only saying it for attention and she had no scars on her wrist the next day, i still supported her. But now she is turning her back on me. I think she thinks I'm doing it for attention but I'm not. if i were i wouldn't hide the scars under my wrist band and long sleeve shirts. Any way so now i have no one there to talk to. I don't trust anyone anymore and I'm too scared to tell my parents. Even if i did they can't do anything. I have 3 other brothers and my parents don't have the time or money to deal with my problems. I really scare myself. I have already planned out how I'm going to kill myself if i do and i tempt myself all the time i never have the guts to go through with it all the way but I still try. I just really need some one to talk to. Someone who will understand where I'm coming from. ",jollyrancher_e_2_a_c3d_xx.txt

0,"I would love to talk about dreams. Only thing is for every dream, there can be a hundred interpretations. Or so has been my experience. I always say that I will keep paper and pen next to me at night, so when I have a dream I want to remember (like last night)... I'll write it down so I won't forget. But I don't do this because when I wake up I think I can remember...no problem! After all, a lot of these dreams are so profound that how could I possibly forget them... guess what??? I almost always forget the words that meant so much to me in the dream. I remember the subject matter, but it's the words many times that I want to remember. So here goes my dream from last night (or early this morning)... A little background first for those who don't know or remember who I am... my mother died quite suddenly from her leukemia in April 2004. We were at odds with each other at the time. I started taking care of my elderly father at the time and he died this past August 2005. I've been wanting to dream about my mother and feel her presence and love since she died. I've only had a few dreams about her, maybe 4... And they have all been upsetting, never ""nice feeling"" dreams. Last night I had a dream of my mother. She was pregnant and ready to deliver her baby. She looked younger (she was almost 82 at her death) but in the dream ""we"" knew she was older like she was alive today. She said ""I'm ok now I'm going to have a baby At least I think this is what she said. My dad was in my dream as was my dad's cousin, who is also deceased. My mother's cousin-in-law was in the dream and she was sobbing. This same woman was crying out of control at my mother's funeral. We were at a hotel in Disneyland. Ok everyone. What does this mean?

1,"Estranged mum possibly dying Hi so I'm basically in need of some help here with a big issue from people who have possibly experienced something similar. So it's a long story and I'll try and keep it to the parts the are mine to tell to keep things less complicated. So first things first me and my mother have had a somewhat rocky relationship from since I can remember, it was more of a rollercoaster and have been estranged for a year. Although the intense emotional disrupt from the relationship has lasted much longer. A brief history of this would be as follows, since a young age my mum has never been the ""settle down type"" she was always away either to holidays guys she would meet online would take her on too out every weekend. Me and my sister had to learn fast from a young age that we weren't able to live a childhood like most of our friends and basically raise our little brother. Sometimes she would be caught leaving us alone for so long and we'd have to stay with her friends so she wouldn't get in trouble and others we'd have to just make sure not to miss school so she wouldn't get caught. After years of this repeated behaviour some days easier some harder living from feast (when mum would bag herself a wealthy guy) too mum didn't win at bingo this week and a 40 fag a day habit is expensive habit to keep up why don't you just have beans on toast tonight, ofcourse I know that this is better than alot of kids we had a roof over our head and food in our stomachs it was always just chaos. Cut forward to my mum deciding she wanted to move back to ireland. I was about 10 at the time and and as such didn't want to move that's when the abuse went from none of my boyfriend's stay because of my kids too physical, she had us all so scared saying that while we were staying with grandad and granny and they heard us complaining this is what we'd get she kick us or grab us, I had been beaten before by my dad before he left so this was nothing I couldn't handle and until now never really tried to think about since. I just remember that I stayed very quiet for those coming weeks. When we moved to Ireland it was just after the first week a man showed up at my grandparents came in kissed my mum and said hello to me and my sister and said he was so glad to meet us. Turned out he was engaged to mum.....and they were planing on being married within the year, all of a sudden the reason for moving became clear. So After the breakdown of their relationship the next week the man moved back to America in the night and that was that here we were living with my grandparents in Ireland with no where else to go, my mum a big believer of why would I have to work I have kids stuck. Now I know from mum's point of view this must of been a heart breaking moment, but looking back I think this is where alot of my sadness in life begins and I hate her for it. I know hate is a horrible thing to hold onto but it's the only thing that got me where I am today and kept me as a person and I'm definitely aware I'm no Ghandi so judge me all you want but wait until I'm finished atleast. The next few months were basically limbo, we moved too late to start the term at school so had to wait until the end of term and summer to join, that's from April till September if I'm remembering right of living in the middle of nowhere in Ireland, sleeping in a room with your young brother older sister nothing to do but wait for the day to end we would take walks here or there and get to go to mass on a Saturday night but minus that it's all we had I realised then that mum had failed to do the one thing that kept giving me hope that one day we could have a ""normal"" family she was nowhere to be found off on holidays for weeks one after the other while our grandparents fed us and kept us in their home. I remember a week going by without hearing anything from her and I had to assume that's it she's gone. Yet she came back this time more shiny and brand new then ever, she said she had found us a house not to far away and go to school and it was the start of our new life. So ofcourse I felt overwhelmed at how amazing this might actually be. Mum made sure though to show her appreciation that Christmas by starting a huge family row with my her brothers and my grandparents, they had all chipped in to buy me and my siblings bigger toys for Christmas, I got a playstation 2 my sister got clothes and makeup and a bike my brother got lego ect that kind of thing, now Christmas was never a thing for us mum had explained from a young age that the santa thing was a lie and we would get what she could afford again this is not as bad as it sounds I'd rather the truth always and she at the end of the day was a single mother why would we expect anything ""big"" so ofcourse she didn't like the gesture and disowned everyone there etc But we were moving to new house and starting a new life what more could I have wanted. So after living in the new house for a week mum decided that now my sister was 14 she could come on a ""girls"" holiday with her and as such they went the next week I think my sister was just happy to be out of school so went plus I didn't mind my brother was older and didn't need as much attention any more so I kinda looked forward to it, after they came back my sister let me know that she had done it again and gotten engaged and tried to warn me I guess that atleast I could know beforehand this time, the guy she was engaged to worked abroad the entire time so mum basically worshipped the computer so she could talk to him all the time she would sleep the same time as him (during the day) and be up all night, if ever the internet would go down or the house wasn't cleaned or dinners weren't in the house she would freak sometimes more physical then not, up until the day she said we were moving again so long story short the guy moved over they were engaged I was still never told by my mother and I had to sit through the guy explaining how he was gonna be my new dad for 4 hours while we drove to our new home, setting the scene it was a country bungalow which hadn't been lived in for years but me and my sister had done stuff like this in the past so we started into doing it up mum didn't like the physical side of it but loved the planning so she kept busy for a while, quick side note, I loved school, hated the abuse for being the English guy in an Irish school, I had ended up in hospital etc due to some of the abuse, we lived quite happily for a while until my ""new dad"" went back abroad to work for the summer, I started work that summer and so did my sister, my mum would be obcessed with my step dad when he was working who he saw etc until she decided he was definitely cheating (he wasnt) and decided she would too, she spent ages trying to get me and my sister to set up dating profiles for her and to cover on the phone if ever she was out on dates, when he returned as you could imagine arguments between them started and one thing my mother is good at is arguing she was always able to make him think he had done something wrong and she did nothing it didn't help that mum would threaten to throw us out if we ever told him what happened. So that was us for a while weeks of calm and weeks of arguing. Mum must have decided to quit the online dating world for a while and started into online poker, she would find out how much we would earn and take that as rent and spend it on online poker, she would take out debts, spend it on online poker, take my stepdads wages, spend it on online poker, this isn't a film so I won't say she was ever good or ever won, or more anything she did win didn't go straight back in. That summer we went with my step dad to his job abroad the company only could afford a one bed flat for the five of us and to keep stuff private I won't say place names but it was a tropical island, 5 people, one bedroom, one bathroom and since there was a casino down the road thanks to mum no money. That's when I realised that no matter how seemingly redicoulous the situation we were just furniture in mum's whirlwind lifestyle. One instance I'll go into detail would be this one from that summer. I had saved  £300 pound in secret we didn't have enough money for clean water or food for the next 4 days so I thought you know what I'll just say that I had a little bit of money I didn't realise I had and buy food etc. So I did, mum seen the food swore and gave off loads had me return it and took the money to the casino.....that is one instance of many. So after that summer mum went back to her online poker and we went back to normal until the next summer when mum decided she wanted to go to America with a friend from online, no prize for guessing what kind of friend, and that's the summer when I kind of shut down, I stopped eating and I stopped caring, I finally thought maybe if I very quietly and very slowly wasted away it would all be ok I didn't need to be around. I would cook everyone else's Meals and just say I had something to eat while cooking, I lost 4 stone in 2 months. Even as im typing this its hard to write. I talked to my mother once in those two months, the time she had no money and needed help. I went into auto pilot I would wake up clean the house play playstation with my brother make dinner and stay up till 3 in the morning with background noise sometimes I cut myself sometimes I would exercise till I vomited, I was slowly dying and that goal was what got me through the day that one day hopefully I wouldn't wake up, my sister was too busy with her new boyfriend and I didnt want to ruin her happiness my brother was too young to understand I thought and my step dad just wanted a clean house and for what he was wearing to work and eating at work to be sorted. So then the message came that mum wanted us to come to America and stay with her for a bit. Once there at the airport was the first time I'd seen my mum cry. The first time shed shown genuine concern for me, in fairness being ""big boned"" in our family was normal we are tall and none of us underweight, and there I stood 16 years old 6ft1 and a total of 8 stone must of been mad for her I guess. So if you guessed it right remember no prizes she was in America with another man he like all of mum's affairs seemed nice but not really in it for the kids they would have their relationship and we would be in the background. A million times o wanted to tell the poor guy but being stranded in a different continent didn't seem like something that we could get out off so I kept quiet. Things went on as they would mum would act like she was single and we'd have to agree with whatever lie she told. Her visa ran out and we had to go back home. These times seem like they should involve more but at this point I was too numb to the world I didn't register it I would live in the lie I had to and disconnect. Mum and my stepdads relationship continued to take on more strain every time with more and more intensity. Mum did try a little more to be a mother to me and even took me to doctors apointments to help try and deal with my depression and ofcourse I don't blame her for it I had decided what I wanted to do and I am responsible for that. Our relationship improved a little and I actually gained some nice memories. So in the next year something well something really bad happened to me, I don't like going into too many details but the overall was I taken advantage of by someone I thought I could trust and to this day I still struggle with calling it rape but deep down I know that it was, my sexuality had never been a big deal to me as id always known and never acted on it but I told someone for the first time and well yeah non consenting acts occurred. The reason why I'm saying this is because Its what lead me to try to come out to my mother, our relationship was at its best and so I felt I needed to tell someone what had happened to me and at the very least try and get some help because I was already mental as fragile as I was. The long and short is it didn't turn out well, I mean imagine your worst situation and how low you felt. Now sink a little lower. I tried to tell my friends and get help and if not for one person I don't think I would have made it through. I still had to finish school though and with only a year left I lived through that situation and my past experiences taught me how to become numb. Cut to me getting the results I needed and getting into the course I wanted. I moved out after much arguing and for the first time I was free to be the person I knew I could be, I made so many new friends i gained weight for the first time I was always independent and knew I was happy. Like actually happy. I met a guy the most thoughtful caring person and still to this day I think I'm glad I didn't die because every day is worth whatever he'll I went through Stuff with mum was still messy but it was away and in it's neat little box of past baggage. She would ring and talk about a new guy she met and then talk about how much she loves my step dad. I finally thought you know what last chance I'm going to tell her about the guy in my life and if she didn't like it then I could move on and understand that maybe she wasn't supposed to understand and leave it at that but to my suprise she seemed fine with it. Weeks past he met my family and my mum was lovely it was weird like she was a different person out relationship became so much better she still borrowed money shed never give back and cheated but we could talk about other things normal things. Things continued with their ups and downs for a few years I carried on being happy and asked the guy to marry me which he said yes too. That's when the bigger troubles started. So a quick list. Mum wouldn't allow him to keep the engagement ring on. She demanded monthly visits regardless of what was happening Started alienating his family and comparing their lives and how different they were to us Pitting my brother and sister against me and themselves And just general, idk mental abuse without sounding too intense it was weird because anytime it would get seriously intense and be basically ruining any day to day stability she would stop and be nice again for a few weeks. It was unfair to my fiance though alot of the time it felt as if she kept making situations in which he would have to increasingly prove him self with the more he would do. Sometimes it came down to outright having to prove his love to me and became more and more frequent. She started to try and control our wedding ie spending, decor etc. The event that started the end was when we had to unfortunately rehome our cat due to him not getting along with our dog etc this sent mum berserk she rang my work demanding to speak to me and completely dressed me down on the phone and my fiance and how dare we calling me and my fiance worse than our father's  (both of which had left us as kids) She said we weren't to rehome it and weren't allowed etc. My sister and brother got involved and were repeating my mother's words. Showing the same cycle of go along with mum or terrible things happen. So then there was an issue with Christmas this is a long one so to keep it short basically how dare I suggest to go to my fiances family even though he had been to ours and how as my mother I am not allowed at this point I'm 23 years old. Straw that broke the camel's back, mum's dog unfortunately died, and with work I wasn't able to make it down and neither was my fiance, we were barred from the ""open house"" they decided to do for the dog and we received phone calls daily calling us all the names under the sun. My fiance had recently got a job with the nhs and was starting it on the Monday and as such said on Facebook he was happy to about this. Now I got a phone call from my mother but it wasn't a sane person it was unbelievable and to this day still scares me, from moments maniacal laughter to screaming to whispering she did it all at how dare he be happy on the day her dog was being cremated......it was some scary stuff like I am a huge animal lover yes but the way she felt personally attack that someone had something good in their life when she didnt that day was disturbing. That night my sister calls and is basically the same except for the line ""if you can't attend dog funerals then we can't attend weddings"" and that was it. That was the moment. I hung up the phone saying I wish them happiness and health and that if this is the way it is then that's it. And that was it I blocked them from contacting me and had one of the best years of my life. I have become mentally stronger, I am happier and I'm well I feel like the person I'm supposed to be. Until today I get a message from an account on Instagram ""mum has cancer can you give me a number to contact you on"" Now in all this I haven't even mentioned everything like the fact mum has pretended to have a heart attack before and has lied about equally as worse. I know it's a horrible thing to not want to reach out after a message like that but I don't want to go back to the pain I was in before I feel like can't breathe when I even think about giving my number and know that even if it's true and she does have cancer that I could never have a relationship that isn't toxic with these people I need advice and help but mostly I needed to share so thanks if ya read this far there's so much to this and I feel like I haven't even mentioned half the stuff that happened but please do I stick to social norms and try and be a good son or do I put my mental health first. Thanks ",Westernboy93.txt

Fast forward a few years and I have found myself out of the restaurant industry and creating an alternative marketing company with my best friend. This is where I found my love for photography and content creation. My passion for human interaction and learning about people has been inherit nature since I was a child. I feel when meeting strangers our filters are down, there are no pre programmed family/community paradigms, is this not the best opportunity to be your true self? So what better than combine my two passions of photography and human interaction into a Human Thesis with a Photography Minor. Getting to Know a Stranger. If you or someone you know could use a kind interaction by Getting to Know a Stranger, please comment below or shoot me an email at abistrin@yahoo.com. All meeting are private unless the consent from both people is given. This is a project of human kindness. Hope to meet you soon! Much love! Aaron B ",ajbissc.txt

1,"Yeah, so today I wasted sitting around doing nothing, but wishing that I could do other things. I should stop sitting around not doing anything about it, but I don't know. Maybe this right now is just pms I don't know haha. I wish that whole deal with Brendan never happened. I really liked him alot, and as much as we all say this, he was different. He is different, I swear it. I was so so upset when he said we couldn't be together, but I didn't tell him. maybe I should have. I didn't want to put more on his shoulders though, so maybe i did the right thing? Either way, now for some reason he's upset, though he doesn't tel me anything anymore. so I don't know, maybe him and amanda got in a fight. Maybe his dads being stupid. Oh well. Moving on..  Justin pissed me off today, well kind of. Originally i was going to take a day off of work on the 12th to go to ozzfest with him. Now he was whinning about a hurt ankle, I told him take some painkillers get a brace and lets go. The he made the excuse of his mom was being dumb about it. He's just a talker i think, but then again I am too. I try not to be, but its just how things go sometimes I guess. I need to work on that.  I feel so sick right now, all because of the stupid period. Rawr guys should have to go through this. Then again I don't have to worry about boners or blue balls or any of that guy stuff. So I guess its all good.  Another 3rd of July that I won't be doing anything for. Darn. Oh well next year should be good, maybe charles, his friend and i will all end up throwing a party. If that actually happens where I'd move in with him. Who knows, I've got plenty of time to plan anyways.  I hate stupid drama. Especially people who just start it cause they want something to talk about and look cool with. so so stupid. Then again I don't know. maybe i do to..I hope not hah.

1,"Help...Relationship with my depressed, mentally messed up friend This is my first time posting on reddit, sorry if I have made any mistakes. This post is gonna be quite long. To start with, my friend and I are both 15 year olds living in Hong Kong and we study in the same school. She is a great person, very special, someone I can never forget. The problem is that she is the kind of person who smiles in front of people but is actually depressed. And I feel like I will just make things worse. Because of her laughs and near-crazy actions, nobody knows her true feelings. In fact she constantly complains about everything, being unpopular, being immature, the education system here, her online friends, just to mention a few. She is tired and feels like a loser all the time. Games and cosplaying is the only way she escapes from reality. I don't mind listening to rants. It's ok to be sad. But I seriously do not know how to respond when she comes up with questions related to suicide. During lessons my friend would show me long paragraphs about her self hate and ask for my reply. A typical example of our conversation: ""Why am I so unpopular?"" ""..."" ""WHY AM I SO UNPOPULAR."" ""...maybe you have different hobbies and interests from most people?"" Then she starts to regret her choices, why did she choose to study in this school, if she had been in another school, she would have been happier... etc. In her letters, she questioned about the meaning of life. She wrote about ""nightmares"", ""thought crimes"" and ""leaving the endless circle of life"". That left me terrified. All I could do is to sit next to her speechless. If I said something wrong she would just jump off from the roof. Not to mention all those confusing philosophical questions. I can never give an answer simply because I don't know how. I once asked the school social workers how to talk to a depressed friend. Her advice was literally trash, and I ended up crying when I talked about her suicidal thoughts. I have no idea what to do. The next day when you see her at the school gates, she puts on that smile again, but she definitely has problems. Anyone has experience in dealing with such friends? Depressed friends who smiles all the time? It sounds weird to ask what I can do for you, because she normally won't respond (at least I think so). What should I (or should not) say to her?

0,"Getting motivated to get help I was diagnosed with a mood disorder and PTSD ~1.5 years ago. I was getting help for a while but I dropped out of school and moved out of state so I just haven't been able to do that in the past year. I live with (and mooch off of) an SO but I've been fairly isolated for about 6 months. I've been doing online school but had to drop my classes this semester when I started working. Now all I do is this stupid part-time job. I should probably quit because it makes me incredibly suicidal. It's all so superficial. It doesn't feel beneath me but I really just don't mesh with it. Anyway. Health insurance. I can't figure out how to fill out the income stuff. A hospital near me has people that can help but I just can't find the motivation to even call them. It's like I'm trying to prevent myself from getting help. It's not even just psychiatric reasons that I want health insurance. I have a referral for a neurologist. I've been having memory issues, twitches, etc. I know I won't go without insurance. I probably could stand to get on birth control and check out some other persistent problems too but a) I know I won't be taken seriously and b) the only thing I genuinely like about myself is my mind so that's the priority. I'm not completely not trying. I'll take St. John's Wort if I'm persistently suicidal but it doesn't help with motivation. I've been going to support groups. I'll ""decide"" to be motivated but end up collapsed and sobbing before I get out of the door. Play music, leave my phone behind so I don't get sidetracked. Tell people what I'm doing so I feel pressured to keep my word. Incentivize with promises of fast food, caffeine, or chocolate. I dunno what else to do. I can't even tell if it's laziness or depression or something else. The only thing that motivates me to go to work is fear which is also the main thing that prevents me from quitting.

1,"I lost my closest So recently one of my biggest fears came true. I don’t have many friends and that’s because I always feared that a friend would know me and just completely hate me. So I only had like two or three friends for this reason. Then I was diagnosed with depression, so I tried to tell my best friend at the time that I had depression and that over the last year or so that may be why I had done some weird drastic things (in this time I never did anything to harm my friend emotionally or physically). While I was telling him he became hostile towards me and then told who told his girlfriend who in turn became hostile towards me and told me I was a shit person (A shit father and a shit boyfriend). That was 3 months ago. So I stopped talking to them because of that I tried going to my closest friend about something I never talked about ever to anyone and it caused them to walk away. Then I sought out help and I started to recover from the issue the and I made regular updates about on Facebook because I was finally ready to talk about my issue, but one day when I said I lost a friend him and the other person I thought was my friend attacked me in the comments because I made a side comment about what happened between us. I never mentioned names. I tried to move on with my life but they were the only friends I really had and I so completely distraught because I don’t know what to do or honestly really how to make new friends. I feel like now since it has finally happened to me I can deal with people who I thought were friends turning their backs on me but I just don’t know how to make friends. Can I get some advice on what to do. Also I’m a 22 year old guy with a baby and a happy relationship. Do I even need friends? ",Its_Jairudius.txt

0,"Im wasting my life As a 15 year old currently, I feel like i'm entirely disconnected from every human soul on this planet. I cannot properly have social interactions with others without me overthinking stuff that person says. What I mean is, if a ""friend"" tells me i'm dumb jokingly, I take it at heart. I take everything too literal, I cannot properly talk to others without me being awkward and silent. I cannot talk to people if I have ignore them constantly, if someone addresses me so they can talk to me, I sometimes ignore them and pretend like I never heard them. If a person says hi to me, I stay silent. I'll never get a girlfriend, i'll never feel a girls hand, or the feeling of affection, comfort, and attention. I never even got to talk to a girl before. Seeing everyone at school socializing with their girlfriend, hugging them, doing everything for them, absolutely destroys me as a person. I can see why I got bullied. Those times I was called ""Pussy"" ""Weak"" ""Retarded"" turned out to be true. The physical bullying I received, when they pulled my hair and embarrassed me in front of everyone in class by flipping me off my chair. I understand now, the stuff I deserve. I can see why my dad abondoned me ever since I was born, he was never there for me, I don't know what type of man he is or how he looks like. The brothers and sisters I never met, which I dearly wish I could. They're all so young, I wish I could have been a big brother for them. I hate living in isolation and loneliness. As if I wasn't lonely enough at school, but now at home. Everyone takes their brothers and sisters for granted, but a person like me would love one of those. My grandparents and mom say they love me, which I do believe, but I still feel no more or less that same, it doesn't matter in the end. I cannot do simple activities at school that involve groups, no because a person could possibly screw it up for us, but because I need to socialize. I cannot do sports because it involves me being around people and I absolutely despise it. What am I so afraid of? Being judged? Why am I here? What am I? It doesn't matter, I still die in the end anyways. Maybe taking my own life is the answer, it resolves all the pain I have received. Who cares what my so called family feels? They must know its for my own personal benefit, they should realize that when I do eventually end myself, that I will no longer feel the pain I once received. I never have felt an emotional connection between any of my family, they're doing their own thing in their life. Nobody at school would care, I only have two friends. Ones I hold dear because they understand my pain. Looks are deceiving aren't they? A lot of people in my school consider me attractive and cute, but good does that do me? I won't get any benefit from it either way.  A bit of a description of how I look like, long hair, feminine face, a thin appearance (not super thin, I weigh about 130). But anyways, I simply plan on ending my own life sooner or later, I don't know how long I can last. We have no value, no significant purpose of existing, so might as well end it now. I constantly wear this mask where i pretend i'm happy, when i'm not. The only thing I do with my life is listen to Joy of Mans Desiring in bed, contemplating my existence. ",crapshitfeces.txt

I hang out with them but, I’m always the  second one. By second one, I mean like a second choice. When one of them isn’t at school or aren’t with them, they’ll come to me. It’s a problem when I have to get a pair for class activities like in PE. I had a friend who I thought she could be my real friend. I’ll call her hailey. I one told her a secret and she spoiled it to the whole school. I still gave her a chance. She started being really harsh on me and what I like which is photography. She would always insult me and say negative things that makes me think negative. I realized that we didn’t really go well and that our interests are very different. So We kinda stopped hanging out often. I tried my best to be funny and social. My friendship between my friends (Natalie and Monica)  were getting better but I was still the one that they didn’t really care. Now hailey is trying so hard to be friends with Monica, Natalie and maybe me. Natalie knows that she’s trying to “be like us” but Monica doesn’t. Monica is slowly hanging out with hailey. Hailey started to ask me what I like to wear and all the small stuff. And she also wouldn’t stop talking about my crush and his best friend. Which is uncomfortable for me. her personality changed and I realized she is actually trying to be like my friends.

0,"""I used to be you"" ""It gets better"" ""You have to love yourself first"" &amp; other lies Not even sure if I should post in this sub, but.. To the people who *used to* suffer from depression, from trauma, from anxiety, from whatever made you miserable, I'm not you. You were once miserable, like me, you saw no light at the end of the tunnel, but then, you didn't give up. *Something* happened. Now you're happier, now you've got your happy ending, now you've got people who love you for who you are. But I'm not you. You probably changed, you probably were capable of change, were strong enough to change yourself even. I'm not you. I've been gone for a long time, now. There is nobody here but bad habits and terrible feelings. Sometimes I feel a semblance of someone who just wanted to make other people happy and be loved, but I think the misery just piled on like miles of permafrost. I can't blame people for not loving me, but I do blame them for lying to me. Don't they know it hurts more to say 'I care' when they don't, and it takes me much too long to figure it out? How am I ever supposed to trust people when they say they care if it's been such a common lie? The worst part is, *nobody can prove it, because nobody can help me, because nobody knows how or wants to*, I don't know. I've been asking for help for a long time now but nobody takes me seriously. You, who says that I shouldn't give up. Why? I'm not you. Years from now I will *not* be surrounded by people who love me, I will *not* be anywhere closer to happiness, I will *not* find anyone who loves me. If that person exists, and perhaps they do, I will *not* ever have the luck to meet them. You tell me I have to love myself before anyone else will. Those who grow in complete solitude don't even learn a human language. So tell me, if there is nobody to show me how to, how do you expect me to teach myself to love myself? I think you just want to place the blame on me. I don't 'love' myself and so that's why I am miserable. Not because of depression, not because of isolation, not because of poverty, not because of heartbreak, it's because I don't love myself in a world that's only taught me to hate and criticize myself. In this world where the people I thought I could perhaps give my heart to, say 'I care about you' and then show me those words are meaningless. Forgive me for being skeptical about getting better when I've only seen my life decline since it began. I'm not even asking for pity, because I know it's just the luck of the draw and I was dealt a particularly shitty hand. But can you please understand that not all of us are going to be okay in the end? Just because you suffered for many years and I've suffered for many years and you no longer suffer like you used to, doesn't mean I'm not going to continue suffering as I always have been.

1,"Today, my mother tried to commit suicide. Due to recent family events, it awakened childhood feelings of abandonment, inadequacy, and loneliness in my mom. She felt alone. Luckily, she was too coward to utilize her personal firearm. She chose to drink herself into an oblivion and inhale exhaust fumes. The exhaust fumes made her tired, and in her tired stupor, she thought she could sit outside and freeze to death. She had a bottle of heart pressure medication as a backup. I thank my lucky stars that she fell asleep in the grass instead. Her attempt was unsuccessful. Originally I blamed myself for having been hard on her. I have always been honest with my mother, and she has always kept a strong face. But today I learned how fragile she truly is. I take it upon myself to protect her, and support her, no matter what. She raised me and continues to raise my younger siblings. It’s time that we give back. I have been thankful that I have not suffered the loss of someone I love to suicide. I thought that I would see the signs if it were going to happen. I didn’t. I will be more aware and I will show my love for people I care about. I often think about the ones I love but don’t take the time to reach out. That changes today. I refuse to hold back my love for fear of being hurt and pushed away, for the people I love are not hearing it enough but still stay. I am grateful for the second chance with my mother. I have thought often about missing her someday when she dies. I never thought that it might come so soon. I am renewed and reborn. My goals and ambitions stronger than ever.  My love for my family renewed in the wake of our war. My mother the warrior on the front lines, taking the shots from sibling to sibling and softening the blow so we all can continue the crusade. This will change. Today I choose to love. ",Creenburg.txt
1,"So, I swear I meet someone everyday that is so profound, I dont think that I ever have the thoughts to equate to their greatness. I met this guy once who changed my life in 2 days of subbing for one of my classes. A free-lance actor, better yet, a free-lance thinker. I can see why people say that when you meet the right person you could run away with them and nothing would ever matter.  In the book Catch 22, they talk about running away. And they debate, that running away is bad, because your problems will eventually come back to haunt you, and the conclusion was that he wasnt running away, he was running to his problems, rather making his life more interesting with every second that he spends.  Sometimes, with all of my set ""life-plans"" I want to not forget, that I cant live in--what will happen in the future, but rather in this moment. I never want to be the girl who is uncontent with this moment, because I cant wait for the next moment.  Could that free-lance thinker help me run away. All i know is that, when I want a serious relationship and even think about marriage, I want to meet someone exactly like him. Who I can ""run away"" with, to solve my problems head on, and live in this moment. ",4142755.200408040.female.17.txt

Never really felt that way before. My new girlfriend Georgia has made me really happy inside, ya know? She makes me feel like I actually am important and thats a great feeling. My ex-girlfriend got really mad cause I was friends with girls, and cheated on me. Eh it was really dumb, and it was a friend of mine. And then she dumped me and said I could go out with anyone I would want, so I went out with Georgia. It felt like 9 months went down the drain and all that stuff. But finally yesturday she said she was sorry and ""demanded"" me to take her back. I told her I didn't wanna deal with it and move on with my own life, but I would like to be a good friend still. She got really angry and hung up the phone. Today She called me back and said she was sorry, then I told her I respect everything she says and all of her desicions.

I loathe Trump and all he stands for. My grandmother lost every single relative in Europe to the Nazis, and two days after the election I saw another student at the University come in wearing an SS logo. And with Nazis marching every month I am am ashamed to be American. I have been running behind in college for a while, but as long as I had serving my country to look forward to I kept going. At this point though I would rather be dead than associated with this country. I can't even avoid the toxicity of politics because that is what my degree is in. I spent the last year trying as hard as I could to think of any reason to keep going. I can't find one. I wrote my first suicide note last month all about my feeling of meaninglessness in a country that killed the country I loved. While I wallowed in self loathing, I have costed my mother so much money. Once my sister started college she had to cash out her 401k to keep us both in college because I didn't get a scholarship and didn't graduate. I would get a job, but I don't have a driver's license and public transportation doesn't go by my house. When I drop out of school my student loans will come due, and if I can't pay them my family will try. The only way out I can think of is death.

1,"How to disown my sister How do I remove my 18 year old sister from the family? I’m her younger brother (16) and all my life my sister has been nothing but manipulative towards my parents.

This isn’t the first time it’s happened, which is why I’m taking into serious consideration of kicking her out of our family. I understand my sister means a lot to me so it won’t be easy but her behavior have made my mom cry more times than I can count.

0,"I walked out of a job yesterday. I took my 'dream job' in early January, only to discover that it isn't my dream job at all.  I thought I would like working in a medical office, but this particular medical office has two doctors, one part-time staff member, and a cluster of other problems. I quit on Friday; the owner asked me to come in yesterday and meet, and I did, but I didn't stay long, because she didn't show up and the other doctors on staff acted like my resignation never even happened. I've compiled a list of why I quit. Here's a short sample: - I hate the hours (7A-7P 3 days a week, 7A-2P 2 days a week; an hour lunch break was promised in the new hire handbook but is frowned upon by staff as a lack of commitment/dedication) - There are religious currents, including periodic 'prayer meetings' throughout the day.  I was treated dismissively when I objected and stated I'm not religious.  The owner is okay with the prayers, and says it brings staff closer together. - I was offered a management position, but after being hired, was told ""I know nothing, and might manage eventually, but right now was incapable of doing so."" - I was trained for three or so days before being expected to run insurance billing, keep rooms clean and do therapies, and run the front desk. - Staff is expected to remain available on evenings and weekends for PR events. I know that quitting was the best decision - ""sticking it out"" would have been detrimental to my mental health, and I would have had no time to interview for other opportunities.  Still, at the same time, I can't help but feel like a burden to my husband. After leaving yesterday, I hiked 4 miles to the top of an area mountain (really just a big hill, it's a foothills mountain) and had a conversation with myself as to whether or not I intended to jump.  I intentionally didn't take my gun with me because I never know. I am afraid of being a disappointment, and I am afraid of never being a 'conventional,' 'functional' human.  I am second guessing my decision to leave. I already have other opportunities presenting themselves to me and I am lucky enough to have some money put away... but I don't want to be a failure. I can feel depression symptoms creeping up on me again, and I'm trying to fend them off.  I forced myself into a per-diem position today, just to keep in a routine. I'm trying to re-frame this as an opportunity, but right now, it feels like a literal nightmare. ",virgin_screwdriver.txt
1,"Me and my brother cannot stop fighting This is DAILY. I'm 18 and in college, he's 15 and in high school. My mom works like 6 days a week and is barely home except for in the morning (when he's already at school) and at night (comes home anywhere from 9-11pm). He's nothing but a spoiled brat who gets everything his way, and we have to share a room in our condo which seriously sucks. I get 0 privacy and I'll be trying to do homework and he'll blast his stupid gaming YouTube videos and refuses to turn it down. I'll go downstairs to do it and he'll end up coming down 20 minutes later, and it's an ongoing cycle. He gets really mad and throws a lot of fits and I seriously think he's a psychotic freak. He was yelling at me and throwing a childish tantrum a few months ago and one of the neighbors called the police, but they never came to our door. Since then, he still hasn't learned his lesson and STILL continues to throw these huge fits when he doesn't get his way. We've had a rough past, and he doesn't realize that since my mom is always working that I'm basically the one that's in charge around here. I'm not bossy, either, I am completely fair. But since I've always been the one to do everything, he's used to sitting on his overweight ass all day playing video games. Now that I'm a full time college student, I don't have time to do things around the house that I could before. He refuses to do anything including even fixing his bed. I tell my mom ALL the time to do something but even if she does, he'd throw a fit. I seriously think he just needs to be put on medication because his behavior is very VERY out of control. We've been arguing and fighting so bad daily for the past year or two and it's just getting progressively worse. I don't know what to do. I seriously would move out right now but that's not an option as I don't have time to work a full time job and take 17 credits while paying for schooling AND rent/utilities/gas/etc. It's just becoming such a toxic place to come home to that I just stay at the library or starbucks because I dread coming home because I know he'll always start something, but even when I do come home it's always yelling and fighting even if I bite my tongue and stay silent. He DOES NOT LISTEN!!! He thinks HE'S in control. If he were my child, I would've taken every possession he has (iPhone, Xbox, etc) and made him sit in his room all day being forced to read a book and learn to respect people older than him! He talks back to my mom A LOT, and the thing that makes me mad is we won't even do anything to him. I know people will be trying to say, ""Well maybe don't try to boss him around"" but the thing is I DON'T. I'll just be like, ""Make sure you clean your half of the room"" or ""Be sure to take the dog out"" or ""Make sure you unload the dishwasher"". I don't know what to do anymore. I think I'm gonna force him to go sleep in the basement because I haven't even gotten a full nights rest since summer and I feel like I'm starting to get depressed. Every day he's always calling me names, and it gets so bad that I have to call him something back in order for him to even realize what he's saying to me. I'm just so over this and this extra stress is seriously making me feel nauseous trying to balance school along with it. I've tried talking to a few people about this, but all they say is, ""Awe it'll get better"". WELL AT THE RATE IT'S GOING NOW, IT WONT. I just don't know what to do.

0,"My First Real Episode Hey guys... I just really need to word soup to get things out that have been on my mind that I have not shared with anyone close to me, I feel as if this is the only way to fight this feeling of sadness. So to start everything off, I never thought that I would be typing these words as I am now. Not to say that I'm ashamed of it, but just because I never felt I had anyone to share with. I never have felt like I was able to confide in my close friends or family because I don't want them to carry the burden of my troubles, and I used to feel like it would just be a form of attention seeking to try and explain to others how I feel sometimes. With that being said, I feel as if I truly hit my lowest of lows about an hour ago and the sad thing is that I cannot really describe the feeling... because all it felt like was just a severe sense of nothingness. I felt as if I was experiencing an out of body sensation, and my mind could not calculate any sense of emotion besides this feeling of dread that was accompanied by a warmth-like feeling starting from the back of my brain and slowly taking over my head. It's been happening a lot lately during the night... especially since I've been moderately sick lately and it feels like my body is giving up on me no matter what I try... eating healthy and exercising only takes away the feelings of loneliness and sickness a little bit. What really helps is interaction with others, whether it be watching live programs or being on xbox talking to people or being in chat rooms because it gives me a small sense of community and belonging that I lose when my mind is left alone to itself. I know it sounds stupid, but lately I've just been envisioning my feelings as the mind flayer monster from Stranger Things because it helps me make a little more sense of everything to a degree when I envision the feelings as something physical... I just wish it was a bit easier to find the focal point/issue that makes me this way to improve not only my life but also the lives of others around me. ",ThatOneDork.txt

0,"Still recovering from ex-girlfriend To preface this, I’m sure anyone who reads this has seen something similar on this sub a million times already. This is long and the last three paragraphs are my main point, the rest is just an explanation of my previous relationship. A little over a year ago my ex and I finally split after a long year and a half of on and offs filled with tons of emotional abuse. It was mainly her abusing me at first, getting angry for not texting her quickly enough, coming at my neck for hanging out with friends everynight ( I assume was because she stayed home all the time) and so on. The last couple times we dated she was always angry with me for cheating (which I never did) later to find out she was the one cheating on me. I was extremely depressed once we finally cut ties that I went back and talked to her and then she told me she cheated in detail so she could bring me down more. After the breakup I ended up getting sick and after a couple months couldn’t even bring myself to take care of myself. Small stuff like wearing my retainer and showering before 5pm was the hardest part of my day. I know that seems small but it plays into how I feel now. 3 months after the breakup I started talking to a friend I met through my ex (however they were not and still aren’t friends anymore) and we’ve been happily together for almost a year now. There was a lot of useless drama with my ex about this which has been resolved but she still tries to harass me and my girlfriend. Last month she texted my phone from her friends number trying to harass me and it was just ridiculous. Unfortunately I have to see her in May for my girlfriend’s prom, they are in the same senior class and I an currently a college sophomore. I still feel as though I am in a rough place and don’t physically look as good as I should. Stuff such as my teeth and acne and other results of that loss of hygeine that I still struggle with makes me feel like I have been doing worse than her, which I know shouldn’t matter but it still bothers me. I’ve tried getting my old habits back which work for a month and then I lose track again. I guess my overall issue is I compare myself how I was when with her to where I am now, mostly with my appearance. I’m also still very depressed and feel that it puts me below her now. My only real win is that I’ve nearly kicked my drug addiction (mainly weed, I was using it to runaway from my problems) but now I can’t seem too kick my other habits of nicotine addiction and taking any kind of pill or cough syrup just to not be sober. I’ve distanced myself from friends and I simply feel lost and useless to the world. In college I can’t make new friends and just sit in my dorm room wishing I could go back and start over so I could be healthier than I am now. I’m looking for advice or anyone to be straightforward with me on any aspect of my situation. Thank you to anyone who reads this and responds! ",itsmitchk.txt

0,"A letter to … my sister, who has conquered her depression The letter you always wanted to write... Family stuff happened and those wounds in you festered and festered. No one knew at the beginning. You hid it well under your sleeves and at the back of your eyes. Before it all happened, I sometimes looked at you and thought that this would happen to you. It is the way you used to hold your emotion. It is as if you were full to the brim with it, but you forced it down, shoved it into a box  and hid it away. It was strange, but I was too young to understand. And then, slowly but surely, it took you over. You were so young. In my worst nightmares I imagined finding your lifeless body. I couldn’t wake you up. You wouldn’t wake up. My darling sister, even now I still imagine your cold body. How can such a deathly and frightening disease exist? You wasted away. Your cheeks were concave, and you didn’t even have to bend over for every bone of your spine to be visible. Your sharp wit and intelligent mind dulled. Your eyes were dark holes in your face. They were so empty. You slept all afternoon and night. I would lay my cardigan over you so you wouldn’t get cold. But I don’t think it made a difference. You were lost to us, floating in some different universe with no anchor or thread holding you to us. And then you tried to end it all. Multiple times. When I think about it, I blame you sometimes. But I know that the blame is not really towards you. It is towards me, of course. I am your sister. I should have been your protector. Is it OK if I say that I couldn’t really do anything but stand there and watch it run its course? Or is that just an excuse? You are my best friend, even though I am not always yours. I wish I would be kinder to you, but I probably will always hold some of myself away. Maybe I am punishing myself. I don’t know. No one can say it didn’t take a toll on all of us. You probably don’t remember, but we were going to the corner shop together once. As we chatted, you were vehement that you were a failure. I asked you, what on earth were you a failure at? What life had you lived that you possibly could have failed? And you said: “I failed at life.” So what was the alternative, my dear? Death? I’m telling you, I lived those few years in the fear that you would be taken away from us by your own hand. Even as I am writing this, I don’t know where to start or end. In my mind, it is such a mess. It doesn’t matter because you are well now. I have never seen someone work harder. You are radiant and beautiful and clever and sarcastic and so special I couldn’t tell you how much if I tried. I hope you will always appreciate the battles you have fought and won. I hope you always believe you are a success. I wish you all the happiness you deserve. Love you, babe. Your sister ",adriannalewis000999.txt
1,"My little brother was in pain and I didn't help him I need to get something off my chest that I haven't talked to anyone about before. It's about a situation, where my mother freaked out over my little brother's bratty behaviour. He was about 5 years old and throwing a fit, he was in a really bad moment, he kicked my leg, and all those things weren't pretty. Something must have been bothering him, usually he is a very wonderful person, funny and smart, but just threw a tantrum like every kid does once in a while. When he called me a bitch (his big sister, and I might even have been teasing him) my mother totally freaked out, she scolded him loudly and he already started crying. She went outside to the car and took out his car seat and said she wouldn't need it anymore now that he's not part of the family anymore but will be taken away by child services. He stood on the front porch and cried his heart out and screamed to my mother ""I don't want to go to the welfare home"" (that's what it was called to him apparently) and he sobbed so desperately and feared for his life and safety. And my mom then looked at him sternly and asked him to apologize and then they hugged and made up. It is probably the most painful thing in my life. I know he might already have forgotten it and he gets along quite well with my mother (he's a teenager now), but I do think back to that moment and feel that stabbing pain in my chest, as I was standing there passively and watching my mother use him emotionally. He was so fragile and vulnerable, and if I could, I would just wrap him in my arms and love and comfort him, until there's no sadness left in him. ",adynamischesgefuege.txt
1,"Last night was not our typical Thursday night!  We started the night out with happy hour at Baby A's on Barton Springs Rd. Our friend had her 22nd birthday so we all hung out drinking their signature purple ""way too much everclear in them but we like them"" margaritas.  There is a known rule amungst my friends and I wish to share this with anyone who reads this...if you ever go to Baby A's for happy hour and you have 2 purples, go home or stop drinking!!!! We did neither.    You see, we had an urge...Lava Lounge is one of our favorite bars downtown for two reasons, 1) it's located on 7th street around the corner from Fuel so it's nice to get away from the 6th street crowd! (For those of you that are not familiar with Austin, TX, sixth street is a popular strip that has about 60 bars adjacent to each other.) The music at Lava Lounge is formatted to fit everyones liking.  If you don't like the song on now, the next one will make you happy. 2) Lava Lounge is the home for our Bartender of the Month 3 months in a row! (Bartnder of the Month is voted on by our users)Walk up to the bar and ask for Gary, tell him you want the Marcus and Jack shot! Red Bull/Jager shots will come your way! Enjoy...oh yeah...tell him that ATXNIGHTLIFE.COM sent you!  We did make our way down to the Dizzy Rooster where it just so happend that Dax from MTV's Punk'd was at the bar.  We talked to him for a bit, and he said that he was in town filming a movie with Greg Kinnear (I think that's how you spell his last name).  It's funny how when you see someone on TV you have a certain idea of that person, but once you meet them, they aren't exactly what you imagined.  I pictured Dax as the party guy that goes out and drinks the night away.   Party Guy: yes Drinker: no But we had fun anyway! He was a pretty cool kat and the ladies sure loved him.    When we finished our sixth street bar hop, we ended it right where we started...Lava Lounge.  *From here on out, this is here-say: we walked into the bar and the place was packed!  We walked up to the bar 5 minutes past ""1st last call"" and Gary started making us shots.  The night couldn't have been better, good times with good friends, and one hell of a cheap tab!  Oh...I forgot to mention one thing...I met a midget who was an ex-pornstar! (or so he claimed...didn't matter cause he was surrounded by a crowd of girls, so we talked to him.)

0,"How to deal with people who can't seem to be bothered with you? Question is fairly self-explanatory. I ask this because recently (within the past 6 or so months), my supposed 'friends' have started to become quite distant with me and it's making me feel like total crap. They rarely ever contact me despite me having reached out a couple of times. It's all very fragmented. What hurts the most is I see them interacting with their other friends (on facebook etc.) and also that they have been online recently but still have not answered my messages. My friends used to be great, they used to consider me their closest friend and would reply quickly etc. But now I feel like I have been replaced and I have nobody left. Even back when I'd hang out with them, they'd be on their phone talking to these other friends of theirs and I feel so hurt. Being alone sucks. No matter what, I can never seem to make friends with anyone new. The majority of other people my age are living it up, but I can't seem to do anything with anyone apart from my family. I feel like I'm missing out on something. I feel so unwanted to the point I've started deleting all my social media to isolate myself even more. It's beginning to eat away at me and my depression is coming back, as much as I hate to admit it. I do not know whether to take this opportunity to improve myself and pursue my own hobbies and basically just do things on my own, or attempt to reconnect with my friends/actively seek out people who will appreciate me.

0,"Emotionally offline I shouldn’t be writing this, I have three final projects due in the next couple of days and I haven’t started on any of them. But I don’t have the energy to even get started...I don’t know what to do. It’s too late to ask for extensions but I don’t want to fail my classes (that mean nothing to me). Whatever...I guess I’ll turn out fine because I was doing well grade-wise up to this point, but it’s gonna be fucking painful. Over the course of the last couple of weeks, I feel as if I’ve gone emotionally offline. I feel like a shell of myself. I’m not sure what happened. I think the real downturn started when I was walking on campus two weeks ago and saw my ex-girlfriend of a few months with her new boyfriend, but that’s definitely not the only thing that is bothering me. It might have been a death-by-a-thousand-cuts situation because if I take an itinerary of what’s going on in my life, there isn’t much there. If my life had a thesis statement, it’d be that I have nothing to look forward to. Hardly any aspect of my life can bring me out of the apathy that I seem to be stuck in every day. I don’t find any of my classes enjoyable, and now the thought of doing it as a career is starting to give me nightmares. I have “friends” but I don’t much enjoy hanging out with them, and overall, any attempts to meet new people just seems to amount to nothing. I have no dating life, and I’m still admittedly stuck on the aforementioned ex-girlfriend (who has completely moved on) that I dated for seven months and have been broken up for the same length. All I can think about is that if she saw me today, barely able to get out of bed and go to school, I’m also certain she would feel even more justified in breaking up with me. I keep thinking about this new person she’s dating and in what ways he is likely a complete upgrade. I don’t even know what their situation is, I am just inventing scenarios in my head. I need to stop that. Fuck. The only thing I have is that I’m in fairly good shape and my GPA is 3.8 (although that’s certain to go down after this week, which scares the ever-living shit out of me because it feels like the only real thing I can put on my resume). I’m also fairly consistent with working out; it’s not a huge part of my life, but holy shit, if I didn’t do it I can’t imagine how depressed I’d be. Right now, all of the emotional energy I have for the day goes to getting myself to the gym at the least. With my career, I’m interested in how technology affects people and society; like internet addiction, social media, artificial intelligence, etc. That is kind of what drew me to my major in the first place, which is User Experience Design. However, I do little of that (the research side of things, which includes talking to people and learning their stories, then coming up with conclusions based on that data on how you can improve a digital service) and more the design/development side of things (like visual/graphic/UI design and web development, just building the fucking thing), which I’m good with, but it both stresses me out and bores the shit out of me. I think it’d be fulfilling to be a UX Researcher for a popular social app just because I would be able to study how people interact with it. Or do that for a consultancy/agency or something, and start a blog/podcast about technology+society. I kind of largely detest the Silicon Valley tech utopianism that’s sweeping the country, it seems to be making everyone I know (and myself) unhappy in really subtle ways, but it’s become almost a cult of sorts. I could turn what I learn about user research to that. But if I want to keep pursuing this path, I have to keep doing the parts that make me depressed (design and coding) for a significant amount of time so I’ve just kind of lost motivation to try at all. I know I should just push through, but I’ve pushed through my whole life and honestly, I’m tired of fucking pushing. Everyone is telling me to keep moving forward because I show talent in it (the design/code side of user experience) and it’s lucrative but fuck man I can only do this for so long. I’d rather use my creativity on music or writing. I have three internship interviews this week which isn’t good to have hanging over my head when I’m asking all of these questions. I constantly wonder if there is a better, more fulfilling, and less depressing route to the other side of all of this. The social life issue is more simple, I don’t even want to write about it. I need to be more vulnerable to people and go outside my comfort zone, and that’s gonna take a ton of work no matter how you spin it. The first part of this video with James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem is basically my entire life in a nutshell: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYCz06bS380. Ditto on the dating life, although that might be a little more complicated. I’ve only even felt attracted to one person since my breakup, so I guess there is more going underneath the surface there. I can’t imagine dating anyone in my current state, but man, the ever-present loneliness really drains me. Isn’t it ironic though? I want to go into a career where I study people all day, yet I struggle to actually build and establish friendships. I’m like a people’s introvert, it makes no sense. I seem to use daydreaming and fantasizing as an escape. I spend an embarrassing amount of mental time each day imagining myself as a frontman for a successful band; I really look up to someone like Father John Misty, I feel we have similar sensibilities on a lot of things. And there is just something about pouring your emotions and thoughts into an album, performing it live and connecting with people through that authenticity, that really makes me regret not taking learning music seriously up until this point in my life. I could really use that sort of emotional release right now. Same with writing, when school isn’t consuming every moment of my waking day I like to read a lot, so I’d like to write a book one day on something I care about. I’m reading what I wrote and it’s kind of frustrating. I clearly have dreams and desires, why can’t I manifest them into anything that makes me remotely proud of myself? Like am I even depressed? I feel like way too many people here have it worse than me for me to complain about my “depression.” Maybe I’m just a shitty person looking for an excuse not to do anything useful with my life. I’m just trying to make it to Friday. My favorite band is coming to my city and it’s the only thing I’m looking forward to. Its the only reason I am ignoring the thoughts of suicide...I need a break from all this bullshit. I’m gonna schedule a doctor’s appointment today to get a blood panel done to see if anything’s happening there. I might look into SAD because depression always seems to historically hit me around this time (although this time last year was the happiest I’ve ever been, so I’m not exactly sure). I already see a therapist weekly but I might look for a new one because I’m not sure if we’re making any progress. I’m gonna try to get back into meditation if I can find any time. I just want to know when it’s gonna get better. ",BruddhaBuddha.txt
1,"Questioning the legitimacy of a friendship (very long post) Alrighty. Buckle up, because this post is going to be long. There's gonna be a lot of information tossed at you, so if you're feeling like demolishing a massive wall of text, read on. A couple years back, I got my first real job. It was great. The people, the work, everything. I become friends with a waitress, which is kind of usual seeing as I've never been able to make friends with a woman before and she's a bit older than me, but that's beside the point. We hit it off as soon as we start working shifts together and talked constantly. She'd occasionally ask me to come out to eat with her, and on a couple occasions we did and both had a great time (as far as I could tell anyway). She'd also suggest that her and I should get together sometime and hang out with another waitress that's she's friends with. A few months in, my parents discover my friendship with the waitress and immediately assume the worst, e.g. I'm only friends with her for sex/drugs/alcohol, all of which aren't true. They couldn't seem to grasp that we could be just friends despite the age gap. They eventually believe that I'm telling them the truth, but not before one of them calls my boss and tells him that the waitress and I are ""dating"" but I'm too stupid to know it. This puts her in some hot water and she tells me about it the next day. My parents continue bothering me about the friendship with my coworker. In spite of this, nothing changes between the waitress and I. We still have a great time talking to each other, and I even stay at work for hours after my shift ends to talk with her. Two weeks after my parents find out about my workplace friendship, I turn 18. Suddenly my parents don't care about who I'm friends with anymore, saying that I can make my own choices now. I tell my friend that she doesn't have to worry about my parents being involved anymore, and life is good. She also tells me that she's looking for a roommate, and asks me if I'm interested. Over the course of the next six months, she makes several more offers to hang out with me and her waitress friend, only it never happens. The dates never get nailed down, or I just never hear back from her after I express interest. I chalk it up to forgetfulness or a busy schedule and leave it alone. Thanksgiving rolls around. I tell my friend that due to pressure from my parents, I'm going to have to quit working and find a full time job. She's sad at first but is still determined to spend time with me despite the fact that I'm quitting. I start my new job and hear nothing from her over the course of two months. This isn't unusual, seeing as we never communicated outside of work before, but I think it's a little strange considering that she was so determined to spend time with me when I said I was quitting. I stop by work on my day off and she nearly knocks me over when she comes to give me a hug. This is completely unexpected by me because even though we talked a hell of a lot, we never really had any physical contact. She tells me how much she's missed me and had no one else to talk to, and if I'm going to the Christmas party at the end of the month. I hang around for a few hours while we chat and leave when she goes to her other job. Later that night, she texts me saying that it how it was so nice to see me and that she's going to the Christmas party and hopes to see me there. I go to the Christmas party and we have a great time playing games and cards and eating shitty pizza. We both decide to leave at the same time and she gives me a ride home along with a couple other coworkers. We don't talk again at all until she texts me at work a  month later asking if she can borrow some money. I leave and come give her the money, thinking that it's kind of weird that we've been friends for over a year and I'm just now seeing what her house looks like. We talk for way too long considering that I'm supposed to be at work, but enjoy ourselves anyway. Later that week, I stop at work on my day off and talk to her for a while before leaving for unrelated reasons. Another month passes with no communication before I stop to see her again, and this time she hardly notices I'm there. The only time that she says something to me is when I outright ask her how she's been, and even then the conversation is uncharacteristically brief. I wonder if there's something on her mind that she's not telling me, seeing as that would explain why she seems so quiet. I decide to not bother and leave her alone. That weekend I show up to her work after being asked to fill in for someone. Seeing as I had nothing better to do, I take the offer. Unlike last time I was there, my friend seems to be acting like her normal self. We talk for a bit while I work and I go up front to hang around. She tells me that she's going to go home and watch a movie and was wondering if I'd like to swing by after work. I tell her I'd love to and wait for her to call me like she said she would. I never get the call. That was a couple weeks ago.  I just can't help but feel like all of these offers to spend time with her aren't legitimate offers but rather her faking interest in spending time with me. I wish that there was some way that I could tell her this without coming off as uncaring or needy, but I just don't feel like there's a way to tell her this without coming off as an asshole in one way or another. Thanks to those that read this or answer. This has been on my mind a lot as of late and it feels good to get it off of my chest. ",IneptSocializer.txt

0,"I am starting to feel really frustrated with life because there are things I don't understand about the world. My problem is I think too much and I wish I was off in space thinking about a night out in the city but I'm not. Instead I focus on every negative thing I can. I would never kill myself and because I wouldn't do that I really want to know how I can get over all this shit and be happy with what I got. I don't know if it's my mind playing the victim but I feel like everyone close to me is out to hurt me. For example I am 20 and I don't have a car. I can understand I should already have it like two years ago but this a prime point for my parents to pick on me. For some reason my mom got herself into a bit of a mood and started having a go at me which caused me to end up in tears because she told me I am hopeless and so are all my brothers and that I am an embarrassment. This is all because I don't have a car! She's usually really caring but she came out with all this stuff. Am I going crazy or is it really a huge deal to not yet have a car? Is it worth hurting your daughter over?? Then there is my supposed ""boyfriend"" who picks on me about my weight. I am not as thin as I once was. I've put on about 10 kilos in 3 years. I know it's not a good thing but for ages everything was about my weight. I used to weigh 54 kg which is tiny and now I am 64kg. My boyfriend is at university and thinks that my life holds no meaning because I apparently have no hobbies and I just turn up to my ""little job"".  I have friends that are completely selfish and I always end up paying for everything and they can't even do me a simple favor. I don't want to play the victim because I've been a punching bag for so many people who themselves have played the victim so it's nothing I would aspire to be. I could write pages and pages and pages of how annoyed I am but I thought I'd just give an idea. I'm sick of people being the way they are to me and making me out to be a energy drain. Does anyone know what to do to not feel bad about who you are? ",j08_e_2_a_c3r_uk.txt
0,"Law of Attraction is bullshit. Also hard work doesn't pay off. Everything in life is based on chance and luck only. Our society preaches the fiction of hard work paying off because we need most expandable people to work hard, so that the rest can just chill and live off their backs. Also every fucking motivational coach and self-help guide is a fucking scam. Focusing your goals, working hard and putting effort in to achieve them? Yeah, tell that to people with terminal diseases or people living in poverty without the chance to ever get better, people dying of famine or living in war zones. Tell that to the legions of people who didn't make the cut and never will. Yeah, tell them they just ""didn't work hard enough"", ""didn't want it enough"" while you completely ignore how fucking lucky you got to be in the privileged position you are in. This world makes me fucking sick and I get sicker every day. ",FancypantsScholar.txt
1,"Family Problems - kicked out now moving out Issue: I have found myself unable to speak to my parents about anything. I have found, when I have problems, thinking  of doing something new like get a job, am sick or just news about school or just talk want to talk about everday things that I go to speak to other family members, friends, or counselors before them who I felt more comfortable with, which would then get my parents irritated, and upset  and make me even less likely to talk to them about anything because of how they reacted to me. This has been going on for years Except now it has gotten a lot worse. When I have important things to tell them about, such as news about school ( be it grades, tuition, classes etc ) appointments, invitations to a friend's wedding, or pretty much anything of that sort, I leave it to the last minute. Even thinking about telling them anything makes me feel extremely nervous - my heart speeds up and there's a pressure in my chest, I tremble, get headaches . As soon as I do talk to them I panic and change the topic to ask about something else, zone out , or I can't speak clearly at all. Because of my inability to tell them anything  or even socialize with them has caused  us to drift far apart. I am  usually one to talk  and My parents dont strike up conversation with and if I somehow must up the courage to do so I feel like they don't hear me and are quick to talk of all my shortcoming. ( My mom often talk about me negatively to her friends and y other relatives  sometimes where I can hear) Anyways It doesn't go well. If they start the conversation it on a bad note . I have then avoided my family even more because of how they make me feel.  I merely  come home from school , do my chores and homework and staying  in my bedroom ad stay out of their way. I have to admit I am not a perfect child, I have given my share of attitude etc. But I believe that most of it was because I am couldn't express how I felt or wanted to say or what I was thinking and wanted to expected them to know. While I don't drugs or curse, stay out late, outright disobey the. Etc acting this is considered disrespectful to them. At first,I just assumed it was a teenage phase a little bit worse than normal but I guess normal has been ruled out since I spend longs time in the bathroom to avoid them, hiding behind doors, flinching when I am talked to or even walking around different parts of the house to pretend I am doing something among other things . I don't know why I am like this. Or how I got like this( well maybe I have some idea) but I can't shake it. I have been advised to 'just go talk to them' but that is the very thing I cannot do! I don't think they understand how much pain this causes me when I have to gather my courage to even speak to them to ask for advice, and they rebuff me even now. I need some advice about how to proceed and handle this I have no more courage in me, low self esteem and probably some other things. I feel that my parents are not emotionally ..um supportive or open.. are so judgmental and critical I just can't. I've become isolating towards friends, restless at night and start eating all the time or not much at all. There are a  few events that I think really hurt me and thus  contributed to the problem overtime. examples: (Younger) they threaten to bring to boarding school and my mom even brings me to tell police station to proceed with the plan. - memorable beating from incident - memorable punishment of not letting me eat for a few days because I refuse to eat a seasme seed bun ( had sensitivity too, found out after) - memorable punishment mom knnew I was extremely afriad of the dark made me sit in the dark in the living roomfor hours of the night. - I was also left at home frequently ( with no cable , no internet) and missed out on many holiday events with family and outings. I cried a lot at first but overtime I learned to occupy myself with my own company. My mom would also leave me to clean the house as well. - little ""treasured"" things like cool pencils or little toys would be taken away.i don't know why but I never asked for them back, even afterwards nor would they give them back to me. (older) - Running away to school placement - struggling to secure financial assistance from my parents to help pay for my tuition. Scared the I have to drop out. -threatening to donate all my work earnings - and kicking me out of the house with no belongings. I have been torn between leaving and staying. Especially again with being cut off from my siblings as my stepdad prevent me from interacting with them after that. I finally left after a fight with my mom last week ( which included a rule on two day noticed before going anywhere... and talk to a worker about ending my life , which resulted her call the house concerned for my safety. Mom didnt take it very well and kicked me out) I have left and i'm trying work things out with myself and try to get better which is something I cannot do at home.  I am staying with a friend, and hoping to rent a room , get a job and go for counselling soon. However, They are now feeling bad me and are asking me to come back home ( which includes some guilt tripping- crying, using religion ( must obey parents, not put mother in hardship, will be held accountable) , younger siblings- not being able to see them, and now tell other relatives) I have been saying that i am not ready to comeback home ( although i am not really interested in going back, well other than being with my younger siblings whom i miss ) I have no intention of trashing anybody, i love them, the raised me. I just think it would better to reconcile and work things out from a distance. I dont know how to deal with all of this. ",Lifebythewindow.txt

1,"Made grandma feel old XD Setting of this story is morbid but this is my favorite memory with my grammy. I'm about to turn 22 and this took place back in November of 2017. My family lives all along Western Washington and we don't see each other often, so it was bittersweet to see everyone at my great grandmothers funeral. My cousins and I sat together at one end of the table when we all went to lunch after at a fancy restaurant with our moms next and then grandparents. Only two of us kids are old enough to drink, me and my 28 year old cousin. No one blinked an eye when he ordered an Irish coffee. But then the baby (me) ordered a rum and coke. This resulted in two things. 1. My mom and cousin laughing at me because my original order was for Southern Comfort and coke and they said I drink  poor people booze (I'm 21 fresh out of college what do you expect) 2. My grandmother nearly had a heart attack when she even heard me utter that I wanted alcohol. What made this even funnier was when I got my drink and she mentioned to my mom how she keeps forgetting I'm not 16 anymore. ",pastel_abomination.txt
0,"you know how everyone hates those family get togethers, at least I do. All my family is out of state And I rarely get the chance to ever see mine, but that's off point, I have severe depression and a terrible panic disorder, at my last doctor appointment we were discussing easter coming up and how hard it is for me to go to my in laws, especially since no one there will ever talk to me,(that's a whole other subject) anyway it was suggested to me that maybe we could invite the family over here for easter so that I would feel more secure. that way i could be busy with food and not feeling bad cause no one will speak to me. MY husband at the time when I spoke to him about it said that maybe it was a good idea, would be good for me. well today we had a bit of an argument over something i tried to do in here today, i just wanted him to try and understand what its like for me since he considers this a weakness not an illness, anyway, of course he went to his mothers, and accepted her offer for dinner and then came home and announced it to me, he didn't even bring up the possibility of maybe having it at our house. not even for me (also they have no idea about my illness , he is embarrassed i think) anyway, now I feel like he will never try to take my feelings into consideration.

I watched a video of her earlier. Happy and giddy with excitement. She jumped around and kicked her legs, unable to contain her excitement. She was so happy and full of enjoyment. But seeing her be so happy without me has put me in a state of deep depression since. Even typing though his out is painful. Knowing I'll never be with her, whilst she lives out her life happy and free makes me feel down to no end. I'm so miserable, I can't even describe it. Why am I even here?

This affects me in ways like not being productive at all when I get close to deadlines, not being to emotionally relate to anyone because my internet sense of judgement and risk management are fucked up, I have self destructive tendencies that I use as coping mechanisms, I hop on the rollercoaster of life and hope and pray sometimes that it would fling me off the tracks.

1,"Advice Please I've been in a relationship with a woman for some time now, and it's becoming serious enough that marriage is a certainty. She has a son from her previous marriage, seven years old. Her previous husband, however, was very controlling and abusive. Her son has a lot of behaviour issues as a result. He constantly swears (""fuck, shit, cunt, etc"", just to show how extreme), he's violent a lot, throwing things across the room, he's constantly screaming and shouting, no concept of manners. He'll shout ""give me food now"". His mother, as a result of the cruel treatment she got from her husband, is too scared to stand up to him. He clearly has anger issues bordering on clinical. He'll often have breakdowns with fits of anger. She lives with her parents. While they have the best of intentions for their grandson, her mothers treatment of her is vile. She's cruel and demeaning. She constantly undermines her confidence and authority, saying she's stupid and doesn't know what she's doing in front of her son, and then, stupidly, complains that she get her son to listen to her. She regularly swears. She loudly gossips about everybody, complaining about with violent undertones. And to make it worse, she often threatens calling social services on her. Personally, I doubt she would, as she got far more incriminating evidence against her than her daughter. But either way, he would be taken from both of them. So, yeah..... a bit complicated. No idea what to do. As it's very likely that I'll become a step father to this child, I was wondering what advice people could give, or direct me to somewhere that could help. Thanks ",Tom36456.txt
0,"Any advice on how to handle leaving my only friend? LAST thing I need right now is the pain but I think I have to. I've posted here a few times before and never got much for replies, which is ok.  I really do hope I can get some insight on this particular issue however. For so long I've been completely alone and it really sucked.  I managed to connect with my Cousin a couple of years ago and we've had a lot of great times, but more often than not lately it seems I feel bad after dropping her off instead of good that we hung out. We've hung out like 3 times a week for a couple years now.  I feel like we have a real connection but she doesn't show it if she feels the same. I'm an alcoholic and so is she, so we drink together a lot.  I certainly would be able to quit if I didn't have to drink to be around her.  Besides the booze I have no idea what other drugs she's into; I know coke for sure, probably smoking crack time to time, she's made jokes about wanting to go out and do meth all night. She's CONSTANTLY lying to me about everything. She is so very unreliable, in the last 2 weeks twice now she's made plans with me for the next day, only to show up on facebook at like 8pm after I've been sitting and waiting for her all day and then she gets angry with me for telling her it makes me feel like shit. Everything is always about her, she's even more depressed than me and has none of the coping skills I do so most of the time it's just her bringing up all her problems and me trying to reassure her.  If I try to talk about my issues though she pays no attention and changes the subject. I know she's not really a ""friend"" more of a ""company prostitute"" if anything, it seems like I'm always having to buy the booze or lend her money she never pays back.  I know I am being blatantly used, but the company is still better than being alone with my thoughts all of the time. She actually ""ghosted"" me about a year ago for a few months and that put me in a really bad place, I had to check into the psych ward I was in such a rut over it.  When we finally started hanging out again she didn't seem to care at all the pain it caused me, and I still have never heard an answer ""why"" she'd block me and dodge my calls or visits out of the blue. I feel like she's getting worse and no matter how hard I try I can't help her or make her seem to care. I don't think I can handle the pain of losing my ""friend"" again.  I also have OCD and I obsess on things to ridiculous lengths and this is going to suck me into a dark hole for a long time. I suppose I actually came here hoping people would tell me not to ditch her, but I know I can't keep letting her treat me like this. How do I do it on good terms? How do I get over it and not let the grief consume me? Please help. ",user1444.txt
0,"Hello, I'm Yevgenny, 21 years old, and have suffered from depression for...well...I guess as long as I can remember. I started having suicidal thoughts when I was 9, but strangely enough, I can't remember having at that age any concept of suicide. I've been placed on practically all of the antidepressants over the years (with the exception of MAOIs), and am currently taking Cymbalta--no real side effects, seems effective enough. My father died when I was 18, but that in itself wasn't so sad. Last September, I had a sudden thought regarding my feelings about his death, and I found the most heartbreaking aspect was, like I said, not the fact that he died, but that the process of dying was for him degrading and humiliating. Like me, he was very independent--if he needed help with something, he considered himself defeated; he was content in his own world, like I am, but the magnitude of something like death forced people into his world...those intangible connections between ourselves and others, between him and others, seemed to chain him down. When I had my last breakdown in September, I couldn't stop myself from imagining it; to find yourself suddenly and wholly dependent on others, and for them to force themselves into your mind, your world, and find for themselves some memory or happy relic to take with them such that even your most private, perhaps sacred thoughts and memories are wrenched from you. I thought about what it must've been like to know with certainty that death was all that was left, the helplessness of not being able to face your own future without someone either doing it for you or having earlier robbed you of the existential will power to do it. I attempted to hang myself after my morning classes. I'm not sure how, but before kicking the chair away, I forced myself to call someone because the world is so huge, and I've only had the chance to see such a small part of it, to die then, would've been so meaningless and empty--the very things I was attempting to escape, meaninglessness and emptiness. The friend I called left work immediately and came to me. She cried in one afternoon more than I ever have, and she wasn't even the depressed one. So, fast forward to today. Did some inpatient care. I'm seeing a therapist whom I trust, respect, and have thus far been unable to outwit (it's a good thing.) On a physiological basis, the medication is helping. Psychologically however, I've got some work to do. Ignoring biological/chemical factors, in order for me to be happy, I need to find/build/understand the meaning of my life. I do not believe that man is born with an inherent raison d'etre, or that one is given to him by some divine entity; rather, I believe that the meaning of one's life is self-constructed and in continual flux, it is something you work on, something you subsist upon, and yet is something that is always just out of reach, or one brush stroke undone. Not an easy job. But last week I was on my front porch at around 4pm having a cigarette (I'm keeping this habit for now.) Everything was still, the air still cold with winter but with traces of spring on every tree, the clouds were lit from below and the west, it was like a painting; but it was this oddly static scene that gave me the most lucid understanding of myself, that unstoppable, dynamic thing we call self. And so, more than ever before, I'm going to take treatment seriously and honestly; even if there is sadness, those chance moments of serenity that make up for in intensity what they lack in length, in those instances I think I will find meaning, no, I already have, I suppose. I apologize for how lengthy this became, but I'm guessing it was somehow necessary for me to say. I'm looking forward to talking with the other members of the forum, as I don't think I've ever talked to others who were depressed. Even if I don't find much help here, there might be someone who finds such help in me. Thanks! And, again, I'll try to keep future posts shorter, but in my defense, sometimes when I write I don't feel in control...oh, starting to go off again. Ok, I'm going to stop now.

1,"My mom wants to see me... naked? Whew, so my parents moved to America from Korea and had my sister and I. They still stick to their homeland culture and tradition, but I've become accustomed to how things are done in America. Where kids have privacy and all. My mom has been pestering me to see me naked. She says it's to size me to buy bras, but I don't think so. She invades my personal privacy a lot, like butt slapping and I sometimes catch her staring at my privates. She comments on if I'm wearing a bra or not and I find it kind of creepy. I get that it may be normal in Korean culture, but I've asked her to stop since I feel uncomfortable. She said no, simply because she gave birth to me. Whenever I'm changing, she barges into my room barely even a second after knocking and stares at me when I'm semi naked.

0,"Here's my story, however dull and blunt it may be ... High school was great. Lots of fun You know-  Parties, beer, dates, sports and the works. I was never what one would call popular, however, I was respected by nearly everyone I went to school with. This, I feel was an asset of mine and helped me with self confidence as well as developing as a individual. I'm now 19 (20 in June) and have no job, no money, don't go to school and have LITERALLY no friends, aside from my parents whom I still live with a leach off of (what a joke). I am virtually reclusive in my home with the occasional outing to buy cigarettes and to visit my Grandmother who is well near her deathbed. I suppose my past bout with drugs may be a co - culprit influencing me to work in 'close to' complete isolation. Maybe there is a cure for me but, chances are it isn't natural remedy. My addictive personality and past drug experiences has veered me away from trying the latest depression medications or any for that matter. This condition of mine, whatever the fuck it is, started developing slowly. I would avoid large social gatherings at first, then I would pretty much steer clear of meeting with friends (even the closest of friends), and finally I wouldn't even take phone calls. At this point it's all of the above. When I do confront a person, which by all means I try to avoid, I can't for the life of me keep eye contact like I used to and I seem like a complete, uninterested asshole who is simply in a rush and has no time for chat. For instance, a two old friends of mine from high school stopped by at my house today to catch up on things. When asked what I was up to I looked at the ground and replied, ""Well ... I'm [pathetic excuse of a lie goes here] ...."" Nobody buys my shit. If I don't believe myself how can anyone else.? So, here I am today. The table has turned. I am now the chump. The one without any respect OR self respect and the guy who respects anyone who isn't as lowly as myself. And I hate myself for it. It isn't as if I had a rough upbringing. My parents are and were loving, I've had so many friends, all the opportunities in the world. And I waste it all and continue to do so every stinking day of my life. I'm not looking for sympathy.

1,"my cousin Long story short, I have an 8 year old cousin and I don't like him. I'm 19 going on 20 by the way. My mom babysat him when he was a newborn till when he was about 2. I always felt kind of jealous because my mom completely forgot about my dad and I when she babysat him but I always kind of understood that she wasn't doing it intentionally because kids are so high maintenance at that age. Anyways, fast forward to my teen years and his young kid years and I can't stand the kid. He's such a crybaby even for his age and he doesn't like me for some reason. It started because he was taking toys from my dog and my dog started crying, so I yelled at the kid and he started to cry. I don't think I was being over the top and the kid definitely had to have someone discipline him. My mom loves him a lot and always talks about him but it pisses me off because it seems like she cares about him and his dad more than her own husband and only son. The kid does nothing but play video games on his xbox or my mom's iPad when he stays with us, Which I failed to mention is a very common occurrence.

1,"Tonight was a momentous night. Apologies to Kelly Holmes, but while she was achieving her dream of olympic gold my mind was elsewhere. At just about the same time my daughter Ellie took three teetering first steps and our house errupted in a state ot total euphoria. In the seconds following the great event Ellie lost her focus and tumbled towards the ground, only to be swept up in a bear hug and given another chance. We weren't disappointed that Ellie only managed three steps, or even that she fell. Her triumphant grin and clapping hands were enough to melt the coldest of hearts. I can't help but wonder if God ever feels the same way about me. Maybe sometimes I focus too much on the end result and not enough on the joy of having a God who is there when I throw myself on Him in an attempt to do something I could never do without Him. I think next time something doesn't go my way I might try to take a leaf out of Ellie's book. Perhaps I'll clap my hands, grin triumphantly and try again, realising that a little progress can be a pretty big deal. And to Kelly Holmes mother..... I think I know how you feel!!!

0,"I've had quite a few life situations that have probably contributed to depression.1. I grew up in an emotionally/sexually abusive family...but the type of abuse that is just over the line enough to mess with your head, to make you wonder if it was really abusive or if you were just sensitive. I still talk to them and see them at times, but vast quantities of things go unsaid. 2. I left home for college, and almost immediately was recruited into a religious cult where I stayed for 14 or so years; I just got out a couple of years ago. 3. I had my first major depressive episode while inside and although I found a supportive therapist, she too was in the cult and therefore some of her advice at times was influenced by their beliefs. Also I was alternately shunned and ostracized, rebuked harshly, or encouraged to give up medicines/therapy by various members in various levels of leadership in the cult. 4. I very recently switched jobs to a much better job situation, but am still adjusting the environment. 5. We're in contract to purchase a home, which is great, but also an adjustment. The Question. My psychiatrist thinks I've been depressed for most of my life. Which makes sense when I look back over my journals and look at various things I did, said or experience. Thing is, to me, depression as a state of mind became normal. I didn't know anything different than how I was feeling. So what happens is this: I mention something I've been experiencing to my therapist. She is concerned and asks if I've brought it up to my psychiatrist. When I do bring it up to my psychiatrist, he says, ""Why didn't you mention this before?"" To which my response is: I didn't know I should. Translation: I thought it was normal. Right now I'm on Effexor, with Adderall XR as a booster plus synthroid due to a nasty run in with lithium. When I started I was okay. Great even, minus the utter exhaustion at the end of every day. Lately though I've been feeling...things...that I can't describe. Sadness...but a feeling bigger and diverse than the word ""sadness"" can contain. Tired...but a ""tired"" with an emotional component. Feelings I don't have words for, but that pierce me to the bone. And that are not connected with anything in real time that I can think of. Is this normal? Deep strong feelings that surface out of nowhere for a time and then dissipate...usually on the weekends when I don't have work to focus on? Not feeling much of anything in between those times? Being vibrant and full of ideas yet calm and productive first thing after I take the medicines, but gradually fading to sort of numb, definitely tired, somewhat negative by the afternoon with exhausted, sink into the couch with the remote, hit the bed for a nap by 7:30, sometimes 6pm? How do you know what's ""normal"" if abnormal has been normal for you for so long? How do you know when it's time to have a sit down with the psychiatrist again? ",MLO_e_2_b_1_xx.txt
1,"I used to eat strawberry chapstick when I was a kid. When I say eat, I'm talking roll up the tube and take bites of it. I also used to have tragically chapped lips. I would always ask my dad for a new tube when we were in the checkout line of the grocery store and he kept buying them until he realized that no human can go through chapstick that quickly if you use it in the conventional way. Perhaps the fact that my lips could have been used as an alternative to sand paper gave it away and he soon found out about my snacking habits and refused to buy me anymore chapstick.  Now many years later, I have a slight obsession with chapstick and other lip products and if I may say so myself, I also have wonderfully soft lips. But, I have recently concluded that the ingestion of strawberry chapstick has lead to my many neuroses (we'll get into them a little later). I suppose they could have come from my parents divorce, my mom's abusive remarriage, the teasing I endured at school, some chemical imbalance or maybe even the time I crashed my tricycle and whacked my head on the concrete, but I've decided I like blaming it on chapstick instead.  It wasnt until a few years ago that I realized I really did have some strange neuroses and that most other people have very few or even none. In the last few months, I've noticed that they effect me more that I ever thought. I used to think ""oh thats just a quirk about me"" or ""hey, everyone is a little crazy about some things"".  I am not a lunatic by any means and most of my ""quirks"" are internal and really only effect me, but because I know I was not ALWAYS this way, it has really lead me to wonder *When does a person become who they are going to be and when is it too late to go back?*  Of course you can get some therapy or take some medication to rid you of many issues you may have, but after you have grown and matured enough to even realize you have issues then wouldnt any kind of ""intervention"" change WHO YOU are or force you to go through live pretending that you are someone else after you have been ""cured""?

Long story short, we were the best of friends, had a great friendship and were really good to each other. We are all 19 now, and I went through a bad time the end of last year, my brother was shot in the shoulder as a accident at work, and had alot of issues with my childhood come up. The only difference with my friends and I is that I grew up in a completely different way then they did , I was raised in foster care, that was tough, I grew up poor and had many bad things happen during that time, on the other hand they had very loving parents and a great home. They dont seem to understand some of those things and find it hard to understand why I am the way I am sometimes I need my space and need to be by myself, Being in a foster care that had terrible people in it, I never had celebrated birthdays since a young age, like 3 and when i was 15 was when I found out that they are special days , and so when birthdays do happen I may come across as blunt? Or dont make a massive deal out of it for them sometimes, and they take all of that as I am being blunt and they seem to move away from me and dont make plans with me, same as when my brother was shot, I was a mess, initially they were there for me but eventually they drifted off. But as always we came back together and were just like old times, I know and they know Im a person who likes to deal with things on my own, but I just feel like a burden in their perfect world.

Here, have some cravings for cigarettes, my pleasure, and of course i know you don't have cigarettes, do you think I'm stupid ? The middle of the night is the best moment for thinking of smoking when you can't smoke. Think of your loneliness. Think of you inexistant social life. You are 25 and you have no job. You are living with your boring mother, with whom you literally quarel with every day. She probably think you are a piece of shit. You never had any girlfriend, and you probably won't. Almost 26, don't count on me to congratulate you... Your only sunbeam will be at New year's Eve, when you will travel to see your best friends.

1,"My daughter is entitled and ungrateful Last weekend my 21 year old college daughter fell and was taken to the hospital via ambulance. We got a call from the hospital and my wife and I drove 4.5 hours to spend the night with her in the hospital. While there she had to go to the bathroom but called a nurse because she had to use a bed pan. Just before she went she asked us to leave the room and my wife and I refused because we wanted to get a cute photo of her on the bed pan to post to Facebook and compare to a baby photo of her when she first learned how to pee. She got very upset and called the nurse and told her to remove us from the room. This upset us, especially my wife but we tried to keep out composure until she was released from the hospital.  We dropped her off at her apartment and my wife spent the 4.5 hour drive home crying because we can't believe how spoiled and selfish our daughter has become. ",upsetmommy3243.txt
0,Why does depression do this It's destroyed my ability to properly feel love or empathy with those closest to me. It's driving me insane and making me feel like I don't care about them anymore.

1,"Lifelong friend keeps lashing out So I have this friend, she's my best friend and have been forever. ?We've been friends since we were 2, we traveled the world together. We're now 25. She's been through a lot, difficult family stuff, life isn't easy on her at all and her entire life is struggling. Honestly, she needs me. Without me she'd be pretty lost and she knows it. I pretty much take the mothers role. Her mother isn't there (and usually she's more destructive than anything) and I do a lot of the stuff mothers do, including being her punching bag. Because of all of this, she tends to be very impulsive and when she's upset she can say stuff that are very hard for me, like she can get upset with me and then say mean stuff, and that she wants me and everyone else to f-ck of and leave her alone, sometimes worse. It doesn't sound too bad but when it happens repeatedly from a good friend when you try to help her it's really really hard. Every time I have to tell her that it hurts me, I have to practically beg her to say sorry. Eventually she breaks down and says she's so sorry and that she can't control herself. I always forgive. The thing is I know she doesn't mean it. And also I know she's naturally impulsive. But also I don't think she's really trying to control it. I know she's got so much on her plate that it's natural to lose control and not be able to always control everything, but it's really hard for me even though I know she doesn't mean it. Right now I honestly don't feel like I want to talk to her. I think the fact I ALWAYS forgive makes her not really try to control it. She lost dozens of friends because of it but she know I will always stay. Right now I just feel like telling her that it's been one time too much (I've warned her before that eventually I might just unwillingly break), and that I can't take it. I forgave her probably over a hundred times, seriously. And I honestly care about her, and I honestly know she doesn't mean it, and I honestly worry that without me she won't be able to survive. But also I just can't stand being a punching bag anymore, it's emotionally exhausting and I feel drained. I don't know what to do anymore. I can't live my life like this but I can't live my life knowing that my leaving ruined her, which really might happen. ",Proserpina2.txt
0,"I'm just so fucking lonely and I'm tired of pretending I'm fine Fair warning I'm about to just spill out everything I have bottled up into this post I'm so tired of being alone I can't bare it anymore. My depression and anxiety is slowly killing me. I'm a 23 year old male, trying to restart my adult life in college after many failed attempts at succeeding anywhere else. I work and I go to school, I see hundreds of smiling and happy faces, and I feel like I'm not even really there with them. Like a one way mirror where I see them but I'm never seen. I have no friends. I used to be a part of rather large group of friends, but as of now I couldn't tell you the last time I talked to any of those people. They've either moved on and some of them are no longer on this earth. I have acquaintances with people at work, but they have their own life to live and when it's time to clock out, again I am left to go home alone and broken. The only person I ""have"" is my mother, and she tends to make matters worse when I try to open. I'm also desperately single. I haven't been in a relationship, let alone just dated someone, in years. And it's soul crushing. I see all these happy couples around campus, beautiful men and women, having the time of their lives with each other. And I'm so fucking jealous man. I want that happiness so desperately bad. I want to love someone, I want to FEEL loved! I want someone to help me through days like today, and to be there for them when they have those days. I want the cheesy shit like cuddling and laughing over stupid stuff. I want the inevitable times where we're pissed at each other about something, but we work through it and end up going crawling up next to each other in bed at the end of the night, and wake up to see each other to start the day. I'm tired of waking up to this massive empty bed, cold and alone. But most of all, I'm tired of pretending. Of having to pretend. To wear this mask every single fucking day of my life just to pretend to be normal. Just so my coworkers won't think I'm weird. Just so my mom won't go off about how I just need to get my shit together. Just so I can hold up the chance that one day I'll be able to overcome my massive wall of social anxiety and try to talk to someone, make a friend, maybe meet a girl. All in all I'm tired of pretending I'm happy, that I'm fine. BECAUSE IM NOT FUCKING FINE! I'm not happy, I'm slowly dying over here and I can't take this shit anymore. I desperately want to change. I desperately want to live a ""normal"" life, and I just keep sinking further and further down while everyone else passes me by. I guess my rant is over. Thanks for reading if you made it this far.

Then I went to Web Design and watched a pretty interesting video on the history of the internet. After a short break I showed up for Biology and did really good on our quiz.

Spanish and Algebra were easy. Then came AVID. I had to listen to my new AVID teacher talk about how things are going to be different this year. We've been going over this for the past four days.

0,"Escapism and depression Sorry about the self-pity rant that's inbound, needed to get this out there somehow. This morning I was taking a shower sitting down with the lights off - I know, pretty edgy behavior, but it's my way of unwinding and resetting myself between bouts of work. I finished up a relatively escapist story the night prior. Stupidly, I had allowed myself to suspend my disbelief and got sucked into the plot. The writing wasn't even terribly good - the only reason I enjoyed myself was because I could temporarily forget my current self and take up the role of some other more relevant and admirable character. The story ended with a shoehorned but unbearably happy ending where the main character gets married, settles in with his newfound friends, and all's good for the time being. You know, the typical ""insert generic ending here"" bullshit. Fast forward to this morning. I'm in the shower and start thinking of my day to come, making mental to-do lists, and stressing about my current temporary problems. But somewhere along the line, I start thinking of the stupid story. I can't help but start comparing my  life with that of the main character and think about how much I'd give just to be able to live a more meaningful, less real life. Then I start comparing myself to the character, and realize just how _useless_ I am. Like holy shit, I'm almost an adult and am still a passionless idiot who does nothing outside of schoolwork. Of course I can't lead a meaningful life, I'm not worthy of any of it. Thinking about this evidently stressed me out a bit too much, as I started puking what little I ate all over my shower floor and crying. I don't know. I enjoy escapism probably to a fault, but it's the only way for me to feel at least a little relevant. I'll probably come to terms with my role as human being #6,732,385,402 someday.

1,"Need honest opinions on my living situation. So about 6 months ago, my father had an accident which left him disabled. He lived in a 1 story ranch home. Being the only child that would be able to take care of my Dad, I moved my husband and 2 children to my dads house. Our house needed so much work, we wanted to sell it anyways, his house being 1 level worked so much better for him, allowed him to get around easier. So my father has gotten a little better, can take care of himself in the bathroom, needs helps with cleaning, cooking etc. also can’t drive. We are still living with my dad. The living situation has really worked out for us all. I am a stay at home mom, so taking care of my dad and 2 children is very much manageable. My husband and I do have our own space in the house as well. Sooo can someone please tell me why I’m so embarrassed to tell people of our living situation? Everyone knows what happened to my dad, everyone knows he needs me but I sort of feel like a failure. I guess because we don’t own our own house. We have done so much work and updating to my fathers house to make it our own. We pay almost all of the bills too. I love that we are all together I’m just sick of telling the whole story of how my dad got hurt and why I had to move in with him and why we don’t own our own house. My husband and I want to add an addition onto the house, we just renovated and finished the basement. We are happy, I just can’t get over being embarrassed. Thoughts y’all?! ",Kmar92.txt

Since then I've experienced recurrent episodes of depression.

When someone who is just trying to help you says something that cuts you really deeply, or when they are pushing you when you just need them to back off while. How do you personally deal with it? Recently I had an Uncle who I was close with get involved trying to help with my depression and anxiety issues. He encouraged me to go see a therapist again for the first time in years and was just there to talk and encourage. Then when he saw progress he started pushing more and more and I started getting really stressed. Then when I had a break down and started slipping back he took said some shit to me which really cut me deep. I stopped talking to him for a while after that. He said things that confirmed what I thought people in my family were thinking abou me. Now the issue I'm facing. I don't feel justified in being angry at him because he was trying to help and he just got too excited at seeing progress that I had made many times before and then he got frustrated when it came to a halt. So now I just feel guilty at having the feelings and the anger turns inward and eats me up. But the anger and hurt don't go away from what he said either. It's been months and I just don't want to talk to or see him at all. He's reaching out again and I can't find the words to  explain the anger and hurt I feel, because I feel like I shouldn't be angry or hurt. So it's just a big spiral of anger and shame. The worst part is I don't know of I can ever have the same relationship I had with him before. We were buddies. Even if I get over this I just don't know if the trust will ever be back.

1,"Is this friendship normal, and have I done the right thing? Hi everyone, I am a guy, 19 years old and I live in the Netherlands. A long time ago I managed to become friends with a 16 year old girl who lives in Spain. I already went to visit her once and we are/were very close. She is bisexual and has a 15 year old girlfriend who lives 450 kilometers away from her. I also talk a lot with that girlfriend. All friendships come with fights, but recently nothing that she does makes sense anymore. It all started when her grandma passed away 6 months ago. She was really close with her, even more then with her parents. Apart from her grandma, sister, her aunt and 2 classmates and me, nobody knows she is dating a girl. She got very depressed when her grandma died. She was barely happy, she started to get nightmares, she started cutting, and recently she says she also talks with a demon. She keeps saying stuff like ''only my girlfriend can save me'' and ''only my girlfriend can heal my wounds'' this resulted in that her girlfriend is talking with her almost daily for hours while that girlfriend actually has to study. When her girlfriend didn't pass her exams this year, the girlfriend got the blame for it. While instead she was the one claiming all of her time so that she could be 'fixed'. This fight caused her to feel even worse and she started to look at video's how to commit suicide and she started to send photo's to her girlfriend of her cuts. This is not something she told me directly, but I heard everything through her girlfriend who was very scared at this point. One evening she said ''tonight I am going to end my life''. At that moment I contacted her sister and told her everything. Her sister was shocked and assured me she would watch over her. One day she found out that I told her sister when she broke into her phone. She was very angry at me and started making insults and threatened me to end the friendship. Recently she is going to a psychologist and psychiatrist because her sister passed everything on to her parents. They are trying to help her but it doesn't really work so far. Also in the last 3 weeks her phone was taken by her parents because she wasn't doing her choirs and was always angry. In that time I only talked to her girlfriend in private on whatsapp, not in the group of us 3. And after a week she stole the phone for a moment from her parents and got furious at me saying I should not talk to her girl in a private chat. Only in the groupchat. I did so to stop it from getting worse. Talking for 3 weeks to her girlfriend was loads of fun. Silly texts, talk about all kinds of random stuff and I helped her with some questions on her homework. In those 3 weeks all of her grades went up. And she passed one exam after the other. It was amazing and she thought the same. 2 days ago she got her phone back and the first thing she said was that she was going to make a list of rules for me. If I don't obey those rules she will break the friendship. Some of those rules are: - Don't talk to my girlfriend in private - You are not allowed to visit my girlfriend if I'm not there too - Tell me everything that you are doing every day - If I'm busy talking with my girl, don't disturb us under any circumstances. I was really angry. I still am. I told her that I don't have any feelings for her girlfriend and that I would never do something to her on purpose. She just doesn't listen. Her girlfriend is also tired of her but she can't say no to her and she doesn't want to break up. I have some questions: - Is this normal? - Is it normal what she is doing? - What should her girlfriend do? - Did I do the right thing by telling her sister about her suicide thought, cutting, anxiety, demons and nightmares? It almost costed me my friendship with her. ",GijsEclipse.txt

0,"Lost my dad and my pet within the last two weeks. We took my dad to the hospital and found out he had a tumor in his colon. They removed it and several surgeries later he was in recovery, eating, and ready to come home. My mom spent day and night by his side for over a month at the hospital and refused to leave his side. Finally he was recovering and they told her she can go home since they're transferring him to a hospital closer to us. She comes home and the next morning we find out he died in his sleep from a heart attack. After surviving all the surgeries, he dies alone the same night my mom went home. On top of that, we didn't get along well. I'm not even sure he knew I cared about him. All the responsibilities fell on me since both my parents were gone for a month. I didn't have time to drive to the hospital he was at. We had his memorial service and funeral.. then things started to calm down. My mom and I spent time making the house spotless and reorganizing.

0,"10 years I've been managing depression and I was doing well, until last Monday. Quick back story: 38/m/Ireland. I was a competitive Powerlifter and represented my country on 2 occasions with great success. My life was lifting; setting goals, reaching targets, smashing PBs...all helped with creating a future for myself. I started to feel unwell around December 2016 and developed a persistent, non-productive cough. Series of tests led me to an echocardiograph where it was discovered I was suffering Heart Failure. Dilated Cardio Myopathy caused by a viral infection, left my hearts function at 20%EF. Apparently I had a few months to live if I hadn't caught it. Ironically, now, I wish they hadn't discovered it. My world flipped upside down. No Powerlifting, no excessive exercise, restricted fluid intake, no over exertion, meds for the rest of my life, regular reviews in my heart clinic, multiple ambulance emergency rides to A&amp;E when my heart goes irregular. Hospital, pharmacy, hospital, pharmacy... Seems to be my life for the past year. Last Monday I snapped. It hit me. Everything I lost came crashing in on me. I got in my car, picked a place I knew well to ram my car into at 120mph. I was screaming at myself to do it. My left hand steering towards the end, my right hand steering me to survive. An image of my dog in my mind kept me on the road. I knew she'd miss me too much. I'm still very low now despite all my meds. I still wish I had gone through with it. I still think of going to the Cliffs of Moher and jumping... What a beautiful place to end it. I'm dreading the road ahead because I know how Rocky it's going to be... Help me please.

1,"Consistent problems with friends distancing themselves Really sorry in advance of how long this is! So some background on me: I’m a 23 year old female. Had a pretty typical life growing up. Had a really stereotypical family - mom, dad, sister, and me. Had good friends growing up, moved schools as a kid only once, and had stuff I was passionate about. During my sophomore year of high school though, my parents got divorced, and shortly after, I had some events happen in my life that sent me into a deep depression. I became suicidal. Now mind you, up through this point, I have had a close knit group of about 8 of us. One girl and I had been friends for almost 7 years and generally I got along with pretty much anyone. Then this guy I knew from performing arts stuff and I ended up going into a relationship. He was 4 years older than me, meaning he was in college when we started dating, I had barely turned 16 and never had been in a serious relationship, he was charming and wanted me to “not be so naive” and - if you can’t already see the warning signs - this became an extremely abusive relationship, in pretty much every way possible starting with emotional abusive, escalating to physical abuse, and eventually sexual abuse. It completely destroyed me as a person. He forced me to end friendships with anyone who tried to help get away from him, which ended up being all of my friends. Eventually, my college roommate helped me escape from him and helped me to get a restraining order during my Freshman year of college. Thankfully, I’m in a really wonderful relationship with someone incredibly kind and supportive and have been for nearly 5 years. But with the exception of my boyfriend now, I haven’t been able to connect with people like I used to before that abusive relationship. Some friends I had back then, friends I loved dearly, never forgave me for ending the friendship, despite the fact I never wanted to. And it still really hurts. I mostly have had off and on friendships through recent years. Mostly the story is: I start talking to a potential friend, we quickly find a bunch of similarities and similar humor, become close really quickly, they become avoidant/ distant/ flakey (or in a recent case - manipulative) and I get upset and end the friendship. I’m quick to forgive and a HUGE pushover, and people really take advantage of this and at some point, I realize this and that’s when I get upset. The other story is that I start to slowly build friendships, like with people at work, and I think things are going well and I come to realize they don’t really care to be anything more than work friends or they don’t like me as much as I thought they did. I currently have 2 friends that I really care about. One of them lives really far and I only get to see occasionally. The other has started to use the busy excuse with me, but then she plasters her hanging out with everyone but me on social media, but the goes on about how she misses me so much and wishes we could hang out. She literally only lives 20 minutes away and she either flakes or lies about being busy working. It’s starting to really bring me down and I feel really down about it since I feel like it’s something that ultimately ends up happening no matter how hard I try or how good of friends we are. To sum everything up, I feel like I’m at a loss and I have a hard time connecting with anyone. I feel like people go out of their way to distance themselves from me when I want to actually do ~friend stuff~ like hang out. I feel like I’m missing something. ",dsnysthelizardking.txt
1,"Of course the first week went by... not juz wnet by but with events that made me realised that teaching is no longer teaching.  Firstly, 34 periods as a begining teacher. Really heavy. More than double when compared to my practicum dayz. But i took it in a good stride. I took it more of a challenge and I have to live up to it.  What I am even more surprised is that, I have to work more than 15 hrs a day. Is this crasy or what. The first week, the only day that I managed to leave sch early was on fri, which was to go for fridy prayers. This is because on the 30 and 1 of July, there were induction programmes for the new teahcers. Thus I was not able to prepare lessons for my coming day and I have to continue work at work at home till 12in night. This cycle stated on tues 29 of june where the teahcers had a contact time. Thus my work load on tues was carried on to wed and wed to thurs and thurs to fri. I feel unfair to my students because I personally think I could have prepared a more interesting lessons for them.  But then again when i think abt it, the induction programme could have been carried out much ealier or during the holidays when we came back for the workshop where the entire induction programme could be squeeze into one day.  While, I enjoyed my classes. I love to go to class and present my lessons and see the kids literally grwo in terms of their knowlege and moral development. Thus I realised why there is a high percentage of teachers leaveing the work force because teaching is no longer teaching. There are lots of admin stuff which begining teacher like me have to managed.   Fortunately I have a very helpful department which keep in me check with the stuff that is going ard in the school, like booking of the AVA room or the computer lab. Despite all the heavy first week, I look many new things which have kept my teahcing passion alive. One of them is the love for the students. Seeing the ability to see them grow is something I feel no amount of money can buy.  I guess i need more time to get mysekf acustome to the sch policy and work culture. We see how it goes in the second week then. Till then.. signing out wery and still hopeful.....  Begining Teacher in AMKSS ",3868312.200407120.male.25.txt

So last thursday i got back from the JH Pendleton YLC  ...damn it was boring. despuite the boredom i did learn a thing or two about the American way. As you may know  ive been working on a few songs lately ( each of which is dedicated to a friend) and  ive kind of quit  on the funeral one and am at a roadblock  for Haleigh's. Ive completely changed everything about the one dedicated to Herumi. the lyrics are that of a lovesick ballad and instead of guitar and back up instruments, it is solely piano, but rather simplistic. strangely  i consider it my best love song  ive written and the irony is that the girl to whom i am writing it(Herumi) is not even my GF. i think i shall alter haleigh's as well. i guess the problem is that everything about it is too complicated...that damn solo.   despite my end of summer blues i do feel strangely enthusiastic about the upcoming schoolyear. maybe ill meet a nice, pretty, sweet, academically inclined girl whose innocence accentuates her natural beauty...but also strong..like it would take more than one bullet to stop her. it would also be cool if she knew how to play an instrument or knew carpentry or steel welding. damn..maybe  i should find a girl who works at home depot.

0,"I die a little inside with every customer (TW) Let me start by saying I've been getting help for chronic depression and anxiety since January. I take sertraline (50mg) every day, and it's helped me tremendously. I was hired as a cashier at a fast food job in November of last year, and it was a huge step forward. No education, no GED, no transportation, no job experience (except for working for a family company since I was a literal child); needless to say, I felt like I overcame a hump that had been looming in front of me for quite some time. I've had extreme social anxiety since my early teens, so diving headfirst into a cashier job seemed a bit counter-intuitive. Now, I don't know if it was the medication or simply having no choice but to face my fears every day, but the anxiety has completely faded. Gone. Zilch. Good, right? Well, in its place, a little seedling sprouted, and as time goes by it swells inside my heart and head, pushes against my skull, crushes my organs, my spark, my will to move forward. I hate people so fucking much. I am so damn tired of hearing you complain that the price of a sandwich has increased by fifty fucking cents. I am so damn tired of cleaning up after your little brats after they throw their food on the floor. I am so fucking fed up with you cancelling an entire fucking order, after it was already prepared, because the soda machine was out of cherry Fanta. What the fuck is wrong with you? I go home and utterly dread the next day of picking up the slack of my coworkers and dealing with a shitload of entitled, spoiled assholes. Every now and then, there is an angel. Someone who isn't a total asshole to me...it could be something so small to you, but it can make my entire day that much easier. Perhaps you already know what you want to order, and don't hold up a line of ten people because you're picky as fuck. Perhaps you tip me 96 cents. Usually, it's treating me like I'm a feeling, thinking human instead of the shit on your heel. I bend over backwards for these people and do my best to let them know that they're truly appreciated. I've come so far, and yet I'm so close to giving up. It's wearisome forcing a smile every day and powering through as if I have a promising future, when I don't. I pretend that I don't slice my thighs with razors, that I'm not covered in self harm scars, that all is well. I pretend I don't fantasize every day about diving headfirst in front of a semi truck.

0,"I'm 25 years old single black mother and I've been struggling with depression ever since I was a small girl. Throughout the course of my life I have had a lot of share of ups and downs: parents divorced in 1985, father was on drugs, domestic abuse, severe teasing, idiotic boyfriends and the list goes on. If there were problems in the home, you dealt with it at home and kept your mouth shut tight. There is no such thing as a black woman being depressed. Black women MUST keep this aura of being strong, independent, swallow your tears, raise your children, take the blows that life throws at you and keep moving with the beat. If you didn't keep moving with the beat, then you will fall through the cracks; everyone sees it and you will be considered as weak and no one will want to deal with you. Everyone around you will let you have it and you will be labeled as an outcast among your fellow black sisters and brothers. I have had a few suicide attempts and my family thought that I was just trying to get sheer childish attention as to say, ""I'm a big baby, pay attention to me."" They took it as a joke and it broke my spirit down to a trillion pieces. I constantly worried what my friends, co-workers, class mates, and lovers would see me as a walking disaster waiting to happen. At the time, I did a good job of ""covering it up"" for a long time. It painfully and slowly came out. I was afraid that if I told some one that I was severely depressed, I would not get the love, support, and care that I needed: family labeled me as ""CRAZY"". So if you have any comments please feel free to let me know what you think about black women and depression. ",lenore25_e_2_b_1_us.txt

Have to fight urges to immediately abuse addictions like porn and weed. Sometimes do, sometimes don’t. Prepare for work, fight off feelings of sadness about ex-girlfriend and situation it puts me in. Fight the urge to blame her for the failure of the relationship even though I logically know I’m wrong or that’s not fair. She just left to pursue school and had to move on, she didn’t do anything to me. Fight feelings of rejection and feelings of inadequacy in my value to others even though there’s no reason to feel that here. Walk to work, continue to fight with anger issues re: relationships and validation. Sometimes frustration stems from lack of work success but more often than not it’s physical appearance issues and relationship issues. I get caught in a loop being mad at her and being mad at myself and my capacity to deal with being alone. Auto-pilot at work. Able to do job easily, so lack of focus is a non-issue. I spend too much time on Facebook and other social media looking for outlets to expand my social network and friends. Find it very difficult to do so without appearing over-anxious or creepy and new opportunities rarely prevent themselves. Sometimes  Imarket business and contact clients/potential clients. Sometimes a boost comes from having success here, but often the lack thereof is equally esteem damaging. Go home, usually bus. Already tired. Immediately engage addictions, usually beer and weed. Start watching TV or playing games and rarely stop until bed time. I'll leave easy tasks like cleaning dishes, etc for weeks. Continual evasion of solving problems, instead opting to rely on substances to either forget or balance my feelings of sadness. Occasionally I have friends over, but many of them use substances as well or are in similar life situations so finding solace in these encounters is limited. Furthermore, they are my friends of many years and represent a kind of social stagnation. At night I’m usually in bed by 10, not because I’m out of things to do, but because I’m either drunk or bored. On weekends I’m lucky if I do anything outside of what I do immediately after work. I rarely feel compelled to do anything. If I get invited to a bar, I end up going and feeling alienated from everyone and ‘out-of-place’. Most of the time, I just feel too tired to join my friends, but I also feel a lack of motivation because I’m sure it’ll just be the same crowd—and it appears their lives keep moving while mine does not. I am behind on adulthood. I have only recently acquired a driver’s license, I just renewed my glasses prescription and only just started living on my own. I have to get my teeth taken care of and they are a source of stress and physical pain (still have wisdom teeth at 34). I have the habits of a teenager. I smoke copious amounts of weed, I drink daily and I don’t pursue my interests or goals. I know the right course of action most of the time, but I actively ignore it because the amount required to get healthy is just too much. I have spent a great majority of my life single and most of my relationships aside from a few gems have been tumultuous, emotional rollercoasters. More often than not, Despite all these things I feel undervalued in my society. I think of myself as smart, funny and confident in my skills, but I feel that the rest of the world doesn’t care and doesn’t see those as appealing. I feel like without looks and an academic education, you can only accomplish so much and that people’s standards are so high that competition for a good role in society is unlikely. I feel unable to compete when the above issues prevent me from succeeding. Motivation to do anything is lowered by the lack of acceptance in general, the feeling that I should be acceptable the way I am but am not, and my inability to seem to control that situation. It doesn’t help that on the face of it, most people will tell me that I seem like a “catch”, an incredibly high-value person with lots to offer—except that none of that seems to translate to my life, emotional attachments or stability. I'm just lost. ",letstalklifeandstuff.txt
1,"A Question About Honesty in Communication My friend recently graduated from Business school with a degree after 3 or 4 years. However, she continually asks me very simple, basic business questions that many non-business majors would know, stuff that I would think would've been covered over the first few classes. She's originally from a different country and still struggles a bit with English yet she went to school in Canada where all the courses were taught in English. The way I see it, if there was that much of a language barrier, she wouldn't have been able to pass. Even if she had gotten help with her studies, she still would have needed to retain this knowledge long enough to pass her exams, which weren't that long ago. The only thing I can fathom is that she had other people doing her work for her and taking her exams but I don't want to believe that and, besides, it's a bit of a stretch. As well, she currently has a mentor who's supposedly helping her conduct business research, yet she still messages me with questions about assignments they've given her, saying she doesn't understand basic stuff. I even told her that if she doesn't understand what her mentor is assigning her, she should be forthright and tell them, otherwise they wouldn't be able to fully help her. She agreed but I noticed she's still asking me the same questions insteading of contacting her mentor. Anyone have any insight into this? I've brought up similar things with her that I felt didn't make sense or were inconsistent but she's rarely honest, preferring to answer dismissively or cryptically. Not sure how to proceed from here. ",monodemic.txt

0,"Not fearing any consequences for our actions? ""Not fearing any consequences or not fearing anything"" is one of the feelings I have observed in myself. I am not able to study well, yet when test comes, I have no fear of the consequences of the failing tests, even though I am certainly failing it. Same with my other habits, I eat like once in a day, which is an obligation I have put on myself to do at least once. Even then its very less than what any normal person of my age eats. I barely get 4-6 hours of sleep due to my schedule and not able to sleep quickly at night. I know its not healthy, but aren't we supposed to do these things by fearing what will happen to ourselves? I think I have lost the fear of consequences of my actions. Does anyone have this kind of experience? ",SanX1999.txt
1,"Why do I pick the worst friends? This is an absolute rant: I am frustrated and I don't have any friends apparently to work through this with so Reddit it is! What do you know? There I'd convieniantly a sub-reddit for this very issue I am having. First of all, I want to start off by saying, all of my friends are not terrible. The majority of them, yes. I feel like friends are supposed to add value and positive energy to your life and that is not happening in mine. It has been becoming clear over the last few months and I think I need to figure out how to dump these friends that drain me. Here are some examples. I will use letters instead of their names. Friend A. I have known A for about 10 years now. We worked together for many years. We partied together for many years. We have kept in contact for many years. I didn't see A as much when I moved about a half hour away. Life happens. Things happen. People get busy and I totally understand that. I drive, she STILL doesn't. We still remained friends though.  However..... I am the one who checks up on her and messages to simply see how things are or invite her somewhere. She gets a hold of me when she needs a ride or something. I can't remember a time she has ever just called or texted to say hi and ask me how life is. I like A  because she is pretty easy to talk to. We have had a lot of good times and have made a ton of memories. One thing that I always tried to look past is her utter lack of manners. I don't think in my ten years of knowing her I have ever heard her mutter a thank you. All of the things I have done for her, never once was there a thank you. I have given her tons and tons of rides and she has offered gas money and I never received a dime. I never expected a dime but if you are going to offer it at least honor your word. What really prompted this post was something that happened today. A is pregnant and she is due sometime in January. I hadn't heard from any of our mutual friends about planning a shower so I messaged her best friend and asked If she had thought about doing so. Her best friend hadn't even given it any thought. .... she said if I would like to take the reigns and plan it then she would help but had no interest in planning the party. I thought it was a little odd but I felt like A really should have a baby shower. I reached out to a few more people who I thought might have the same idea and they hadn't thought to do it either. I'll be honest, I am not a party planner. .. not even close. The thought of entertaining/interacting/etc with people makes me super anxious.... BUT all that aside... she is my friend and she deserves to be thrown a baby shower. I have been thinking about ideas over the past few weeks but haven't put anything into motion yet. I get a message from her today over Facebook that says: ""So H informed me you guy were gonna plan a babyshower for me...well we was unaware so C and R are getting together to do one...so if you would like get in touch with one of them and details can be worked out....we just know we are having it October 14th"" I read it. My first initial reaction was annoyance. Since then it has progressed... I think I would have been less annoyed if there was a ""but thank you for thinking of me anyways"" or something along those lines. There is not one ounce of gratitude in this message. I'm kind of annoyed with myself for expecting there to be any at all. One would think I would have learned by now. So, I guess the point of this rant is for me to figure out what I need to do about all of this. My gut is telling me it's time to ditch the ungrateful, mannerless nonsense. The other part is sad to lose a ""friend"". Are my expectations too high? Is it wrong of me to expect my friends to have basic manners? Please, any and all advice is welcomed. ",boopedya.txt
0,"I'm not sure where to start.  I've been diagnosed with PTSD, depression, disassociation, and bipolar.  I'm also a cutter, suicidal, I hear things and see things.  Needless to say I don't deal with stress very well. Sorry this isn't a good introduction; but I really do need some help. I'm a college student only because the VA (veterans Affairs) is paying for it through their vocational - rehabilitation program.  I'm unemployed.  For 3 months I've been fighting with social services just to get food stamps.  I finally got them.  Beforehand food was scarce.  I've had eviction notices and by miracles my roommate and I manage to get just enough money to not get evicted at the last minute.  I've missed class and 2 therapy and other doctor appointments because I haven't had the gas money to get there.  I apply for jobs every day, but I have absolutely no luck getting a job. So with all this any normal person would become naturally depressed.  But me, I'm losing my mind.  I can be happy and laughing and goofing off with my boyfriend one minute; but the next I'm kicking and hitting and seriously hurting him.  Then we end up in some stupid argument where all I say is shut up or go away, or whatever.   I just don't want to hear it. I know missing my therapy appointments hasn't helped.  I do have a psychiatrist appointment in 2 weeks and a therapy appointment in 3 weeks.  But I need some help now. I've lost all my motivation to do anything.  I've been in bed today for 17 hours and I just feel so angry.  Angry and fearful.  The only thing is that I don't know what I'm angry and fearful about. My mood shifts so quickly and swiftly that I've lost complete control of who or what I am.  The more I try to relax the Angrier and more fearful I get.  It's like I have to stay occupied just to keep my mind occupied and keep it from traveling a million miles a second. I just need to get back on the semi - sane track.  Right now I'm a million light years from there. ",draquion_e_2_ab_c3i_us.txt
0,"I had my second appointment with my naturopathic doctor today. I'm getting this feeling that she is really just a therapist for people who don't want to go to a therapist. She lets me ramble on about all sorts of things that have very little to do with my health. Like what our rules for Jeffrey and food are. Last time she gave me a series of homeopathic remedies (Undas) to support my liver. This time it was a capsule called Ichol. I'm not sure if these things do anything more than lighten my wallet, but I'm willing to try them for now. I do desperately need to lose weight and if there is any chance that these things will help, I'm willing to go for it for a while. I've been searching the net reading about Katirina and other personal tragedies that bloggers are going through and I'm sort of jealous. My life is just full of 'normal' stuff right now. My grandpa died in August and we went to his funeral but it doesn't affect my life in a large way. Just in the morally rehensible way that now I don't have to feel guilty about not going to see him. It's not that I didn't want to see him, I just never found the time and now I don't have to worry about it. At some level I'm sure that means that I'm headed to eternal damnation. In other news, we've managed to find a geo-cache. It took us three trips to the spot because dusk is not the time to find dark colored boxes hidden in an unlit forest.

1,"My younger brother is cooler than me Hi! So I have a bit of an embarassing truth to admit. I believe my younger brother is way cooler than me. I've never been one of the most popular people in any given situation, but I have a few close friends so it's not too bad. My brother however is one of those people that can walk into a room and immediately own it. Where my clothing style is a bit uninteresting, his is eye-catching. While I'm fairly quiet and not particularily funny, he is confident and charismatic. I get invited to parties every now and then, but he gets invited to parties every week. Oh and it doesn't help that he is taller than me nowadays. He is not better than me at everything thankfully. For instance I'm an organised person and my grades are far above average, while his grades are far below. The point is that I'm not a cool person by any stretch but he is very popular and respected. It's silly I know, but it does hurt my pride a bit seeing as I'm older than him, and you usually expect the older sibling to have the high ground in this respect. Am I alone in this?

1,"overbearing family. I (19f) am living away from home for college in my 2nd year. However, I still feel very under the control of my mother. It is just me and her at home, and rest assured she has always done her best for me but recently I’ve had enough of how much she expects from me. I am studying for grade 6 piano and the fact is that I simply don’t have time for it. She wanted me to do the exam for it after only studying it for 3 months (bare in mind I only get to practice once a week as I have no piano away from home - I come home at weekends). When I postponed it she screamed at me for hours and called me an idiot and various other things. I told her I was too busy with college work, I got my results back for college and did very well; however, she still wasn’t happy. First comment was “maybe you’re not as stupid as we think” and then said that I could do a lot better, even though I did really well. I never leave the house when I’m at home for weekends or any holidays because when I go out or meet my friends she makes it very difficult as she usually starts a row before I leave and guilt trips me about going. I have been wanting a full time bar job for summer, as that’s where my experience is but she is even controlling where I work and telling me where to apply to. She keeps guilt tripping me about being away for college, and saying I’m on a permanent holiday. She is annoyed at me for having a boyfriend; she never uses his name only refers to him as “your friend” in a sneering voice, and she won’t meet him. She is by no means a bad person, she has always been a very good mother but the pressure she is putting on me is too much and I feel very restricted, and at times, controlled. BUT I am not giving out about her, simply want to understand why she is acting this way when I’ve given her no reason to distrust me and I’m trying my best. TL;DR - mother is controlling, putting huge pressure on me and is never happy no matter how well I do. ",Lo2109.txt
1,"Female reasoning Why does it seem most women try to justify or get approval of a friendship with a male by stating knowing then for a lengthy time. Do women truly feel that no platonic boundaries will be broken because they’ve “known each other for 15 years/since freshman year” etc. I don’t believe it impossible for a platonic opposite sex friendship, but I do feel it is much harder for a male, for several reasons. Men typically seem to misinterpret a female being nice as expressing interest or flirting, that can easily plant the seed for a romantic attraction to develop. A mans “natural desires” and wants, can easily blur the lines, and when in the right environment/setting they feel it is acceptable to attempt something etc etc. I don’t see how whatever length of time negates the possibility of anything happening. Do women honestly feel because of a long friendship ensures its innocence? Or just an excuse/reason given in an attempt to “justify” or have that friendship accepted by their significant other.

0,"Here's my answer to your age question. Sadly, I am 29 years old: sniffle1: Don't get me wrong. I don't want to be completely alone for the rest of my life. There's a sentimental part of me that yearns for companionship with a guy, but I have such a tall hurdle to overcome before I can even get to that yet. Yeah, but I can relate to the peace and quiet thing by myself. It really is such a luxury nowadays (personally speaking). One thing I reflected on was that I live in a family of 8 people, and maybe that's why I feel so claustrophobic and irritable around lots of people. Essentially, there's no secure privacy, really. Yup, like you I used to live independently when I went to school. I'm on a bit of a break right now, but will go back in September where I'll share an apartment with a roommate I don't know. Right now, I'm mooching off my parents' food and shelter. At age 29, I feel like a little child. And by the way, I'm unemployed too. I tried all summer to land a job, but in vain. I only worked one day for Elections Canada, and that was it. Oh well, a paycheck is a paycheck, right? The thing is, I can't stand living with somebody I hardly know either. Sometimes I just don't want to greet somebody at breakfast, or say a polite 'hello, how are you, or how was your day?"". When I battle depression and social anxiety, I really really need the comfort of familiar people around me at times. The last thing I need is a complete stranger sharing my quarters.

0,"A Letter to My Future Self: Self Love Dear (future) B, This letter may be fragmented. This letter may be short, or it may be long. This letter may be emotional. Most importantly, this letter is to show you that you can stay grounded despite the rush of emotions you experience when you feel vulnerable and [falsely] unloved. Everything you thought you knew since that day (October 21st) has become unraveled within the last fourteen hours. It’s hard to find the words that can sum it all up in order to save some time and space within this letter. This letter is also not about those specific events but about you and only you, and how far you’ve come; it all plays into being able to deal with whatever the future may bring. As you admitted this morning, to yourself and G, your sense of clarity evaporates when you begin to feel vulnerable. It leads you to a self-fulfilling prophecy - the exact neediness you exhibit will do the exact opposite of what you’d like it to do and will therefore lead you to feeling ever more “needy.” Listen to me: You are not validated by someone’s ability (or lack thereof) to love you. And again: Sometimes, it is not simply not about you. So far in your healing process you’ve managed to understand the importance of detachment. You’re making wonderful progress and I hope that at some point you are still progressing. Your existence is for you and for you only. It is not okay or healthy to live solely for another human being. Remember that you are not “incomplete” without someone however that someone can enhance the you that you already are. A relationship consists of two people working together as a whole yet existing as their own sense of “wholeness” outside of the relationship. That is so very important for you to remember for the rest of your life. Remember when you felt vulnerable just a few weeks ago (sometime in November) and wanted to dive into texting that boy in order to make you feel better about yourself? And then remember that you didn’t because you kept your clarity and understood that it was a coping mechanism. Don’t forget that you’ve done that not only once but a few times now and that is exceptional. I understand future Bri may encounter some setbacks and that her well-being might as well be a roulette wheel, but that’s exactly what this letter is for. As you’ve been told, you are luminous. You shine bright. Your heart is [almost too] huge. You have the potential to do great things. You are not your illness and you are not your insecurities. The grave you will lay in one day will only consist of you and nobody else. If the world ends and you survive, you have yourself. You have to keep this mind every single day. Work on self love and understand your worth. Yes, G makes you feel like the most important girl in the world. But before you can let him do that, you need to understand that you are the most important girl in the world to yourself, for yourself. You’re done putting your interests aside just to receive love for the night/day. You’re done with getting angry at the phone for not getting responses quickly. You’re done feeling unimportant or unloved because you’re not someone’s first priority. In the month and a half since the breakup, you have transformed. It is only the beginning but you have taken steps in the right direction. Future B needs to look back on this whether she’s in a good spot at the time or not. She needs to know that even though she may not be at a point in life she envisioned, she did something for herself. When you feel like he’s pulling away, don’t push harder. When you feel like you want to run to him in order to silence your overwhelmingly surfacing insecurities, understand that will not make things better. Understand that they are amplified and you are only expressing coping mechanisms in order to deal with the underlying issue. The issue isn’t that he doesn’t love you but that you make yourself unloveable. Understand that when you get into that mindset and lose grasp of the clarity, someone moving mountains for you will not fill that hole of pain. The only person on the face of this Earth that can fill that hole is you. You have the capability of moving mountains on your own when you remember these things. Continue doing your research. Continue taking time for yourself. Continue setting your phone down for hours at a time. Continue living your life out and letting others play a part and not the center role. You’re the star of your life, you lead the show. Your family, friends, boyfriend, colleagues - they play their roles in your story. Most importantly, they play their lead role in their own stories and similarly you are character. Learn to appreciate silence. Learn to appreciate a bit of loneliness and solitude. Self-love includes coming home from work to take a hot bath and drink a glass of red wine, not rushing over to whoevers house in order to feel loved by someone else. You cannot be loved appropriately if you cannot love yourself first. Isn’t it just like me to start taking the advice I’ve been given by so many people my entire life. Love yourself. Respect yourself. Appreciate your own time. Respect others. Respect other’s need for space. Live for you. Again, love yourself. With love, B, 12/3/2017. ",yellowplastic.txt

Although the sawbones made all the right noises I don't know if he even believes me. I don't know if seeing him was the right thing to do because since walking out of his surgery all I have had is deeper anxiety, more guilt, and a feeling of total and utter desperation - I think it's actually a little worse than before. I feel like this is not going to get any better, ever. I'm scared ... I don't know how this is going to end up for me. I can't see a way out. I have been depressed for a very long time but since losing my job a little while ago I have hit the proverbial bottom. I have suffered from anxiety for many years but recently it has been getting worse - I had my first panic attack last year. It doesn't matter what I try to do to stop it, all I can think about is death, pain, more death, failure, and yet more death. I have been having horrible nightmares for months (and haven't slept properly since my teens). Long story short  (ish): when I was little the Infamous They told my parents I was 'gifted'. They had high hopes for me. I won a scholarship to a good private school, where the other little girls made fun of me. Then the scholarship ran out and I had to go to a state school. Where the other little children made fun of me, spat at me, physically attacked me and eventually my parents had to take me out of school altogether. They found a better one, where the other kids continued to make my life hell. When I was about 12 or 13  I started self harming (cutting my arms with broken light bulb glass). My mother noticed once, shouted at me, and then never raised the subject again. I continued to do it until I was about 17. My dad bullied me when I was a kid; basically he subjected me to about 15 years of mingled disinterest, public humiliation, and emotional abuse. Then he did a disappearing act three years ago - leaving my mother in financial trouble. I have not heard from him since. I have wasted my life. Nothing I have ever attempted has succeeded - really nothing, and I have never been able to please the people I was trying to please. I used to think I was a talented artist (wanted to be a comic - book artist) but now I have no self - belief left. I haven't picked up a pencil in weeks and I can't even bear to look at any of my work. I can't do anything anymore and there is nobody I can talk to - my mother is my only close family and she doesn't believe in mental illness (if I mentioned it to her she would, at best, get angry and tell me to grow up / stop being so self indulgent). I have two close friends who have their own problems to deal with. I'm seeing the doctor again on Monday but I fail to see what he can do to fix the fact that I am a useless failure. I am so scared and confused. I have been crying for about a week now and it's getting really tiring. I'm scared that maybe what I think is depression is really just an excuse to attempt to explain my pathetic behavior, that I am really a hypochondriac (my anxiety is now constant and I have convinced myself I am going to die any minute from any terminal illness you'd care to name) and I'm wasting the doc's time & resources. He offered me sleeping pills but I said no as I was afraid to have such things in the house. Basically, not a good week. Sorry to vent like this but I had to get it out  ...  sorry for being so selfish. ",dusty_e_2_a_c2_uk.txt
1,"This is the product of idle time. Usually phone support during queue time does not give us this much idle time, that is until you are one of two who have a direct customer service split. Then you get to sit around and do nothing but wait for one of two tiny lights to come on for you to answer the phone. Lucky for me this phenomenon does not happen very often on weekends.

I already skipped today because I was too lazy to start studying before Sunday and of course I didn’t know shit, so instead of taking responsibility I just skipped school.

1,"Relationship with my Dad Hey, I post this as I need help on how to deal with the situation on my relationship with my Dad. Don't get me wrong, I do love him- however I am not sure that I like him to the extent that he likes me. By like, I mean as a ""buddy"" relationship, we have similar interests and we talk about these interests a lot, but his personality irritates me and we have gotten in a lot of arguments, of which I never convince him. I am currently in University, I am living on campus (this is the first time living on my own), and I must say: I am absolutely loving it. Having my first time being independent has made me feel much better. Mainly because I am away from home. I have this thing where I just want to be independent, not influenced by other people's views/thoughts (my Dad mainly). A couple of years ago my Mum and Dad broke up, I stayed with my Dad as I did not agree with what my Mum had done. Me and my Dad were always close as we are both into Gaming and watching TV shows etc... but it is only recently that I have realized I dislike him. My Dad can be quick at losing his temper, he lives by the policy of Honesty (which is a good trait), but at the same time- he is completely contradicting. In arguments we get into, I explain my view and so does he, however he turns my view against me and then later apoligises for not understanding, making sure he will listen better in future. This never happens. This has persisted over the years and it makes me feel uneasy talking to him about anything. I then feel guilty about not wanting to talk to him. Which brings me to my next issue. He talks to me daily. Once in morning, some points during the day and then at night. I understand this is his first time living alone too, but I need my space and it is physically and mentally draining having to talk to him. Especially as I feel forced to keep the conversation going. Pretty much the majority of the conversation is me talking about my day, my thoughts on things and anything interesting that happened. He briefly mentions his stuff, but then there is silence. I try to keep the conversation flowing, but it does NOT feel natural at all. It is not like the conversations I have with my friends or other members of the family. Which again, makes me feel guilty when I want to hang up. I really have tried to change my perspective. It is getting close to moving back home (I am a first year student) and will be commuting from my home town to University for the upcoming years at Uni. I am really not looking forward to this. I am enjoying spending time AWAY from home, to avoid my Dad. Now I am going to have to live with him for the next few years. Now I do love him, and he does everything for me. He is trying to pay off my Student loans so I feel comfortable, and I have been saving for my deposit that I will put on a house after my time at Uni. But the issue is, I really want independence. I feel guilty that I want to live in the city where my Uni is and work to pay joint rent with friends. This way I learn the world of work, but that comes with having higher stress as I'd have to work and study. Which is what my dad doesn't agree with. And trying to explain to him that I want to learn the world of work does not compute with him. As rationally speaking, there are many more benefits of me commuting. And I cannot win, I really can't. He wants me to get the best oppotunity I can in life, and make sure that I get my Masters. But, he is deciding and forcing my path for me. I feel restricted and it makes me feel down most days for each time I have to talk to him. It just reminds me of the next 3 years being stuck at home with him, him thinking we have this great relationship where I just prefer literally anything else. Thank you. ",thr0wMeAway5.txt

IT'S NOT FAIR. I don't care if ""life isn't fair""...at some point, I deserve it. I don't care if that sounds selfish, I don't care of it sounds mean spirited or immature or anything. All I want is to wake up tomorrow and not count the minutes through the work day until I can be alone again just so I can sit around feeling lonely because I'm too scared to let anyone in my life because every time I do, they just make it worse with lies, cheating and pain. I just want to ONE day have someone tell me they love me and mean it. JUST ONCE. I just want to actually have the ability to REALLY trust someone. Just ONCE. WHY is it so hard? It's not like I'm asking for the world. I don't even want it forever. I just want it once. I just want one moment of happiness. REAL happiness. Not xanax / zoloft induced happiness, but true, real deserving happiness and I just don't understand what I've done to not deserve that. ",blugh_e_2_b_1_xx.txt

1,"Friend dumps problems on me and that’s all we do together now Interested in other peoples experience of this and suggestions! Have been friends with a woman for a few years.  Started off fun, we’d go for lunch, gigs and talk about a whole range of topics in person and by text. For the last 6 months she’s stopped meeting up with me and responding to messages (or sending any). Instead she calls me at least once every week for often 2 - 3 hours asking for advice about men, her job and other stresses. She’ll talk for over 20 mins uninterrupted, won’t stop talking when I need to go and will call even if I’ve said I’ll be out or unavailable. I got married oversees recently and our conversation was 10 mins on this and the remaining 2 hours about her problems. She gets aggressive if I don’t offer a solution but when I cave and suggest another way of looking at things she throws it back in my face. She will often cite conversations with others where she’s gotten into an argument, and for hours will push me to give an opinion as to what she did wrong and when I diplomatically suggest doing something different or how maybe the other person didn’t mean it how it came across she will say I don’t defend her and make passive aggressive remarks. She’ll ask me to make decisions and then complains of it doesn’t give her the result she wanted! It’s confusing and really draining. Not mention all the fun parts of our friendship have slipped away and now I’m left with her constantly calling. If I don’t pick up she just keep ringing everyday! In fact I moved House once and she complained she had withdrawals from our calls. Feel pretty used as she has little to no consideration of my feelings or boundaries. In fact once on a call with her I received a text saying my grandmother had died, she just said she had to go and never mentioned it again, not even to ask how I was doing. Would you say anything or just cut ties given how sensitive she seems? ",Smoulder2.txt
0,I'll first tell you what happened just in case no one read the previous posts about it. well I went camping with a friend I didn't want to go and I hate her .. I had a bit of alcohol and started passing out and my friend started touching me .. etc. I feel sick every time I see her and fail to face her anytime I know she's near. I confided in my 2 closest friends but one of them don't understand at all. she says I have to face my fears when I see her in school and dread walking past her or near her. My friend doesn't realize that I feel physically sick and shaky when I'm near her.

1,Ok so boys are a major part of my life so I am going to be posting many blogs about them! First if there are guys out there reading this then I want to say that girls (in general) don't like to make the first move and surely hate to not know how a guys feels! I am actually turned on when a guy is able to express himself to me. Second I want to tell of something that has happened to me in the past. I hate it when guys are not able to act themselves if there is something between us. How immature is that...really. Then if a guy has a grudge against a girl I can't stand it how they center their lives around it and try to get back at them by getting on other girls and stuff. Once again that just proves they are immature and obviously don't know what they are doing. So guys learn to make the first move on a girl and get over the akwardness between girls and boys!! ,3689362.200406190.female.16.txt

1,"Where did I go wrong? Let me apologize by the rather lengthy post: I’m not sure where to start. Recently, I’ve been having trouble with my friends and I’m not sure why. I had a childhood friend since Elementary school, we would hang out often and now she’s a stranger. She would say she was busy, but the last day I texted her, my dad had kidney surgery because he had cancer in his kidney. They removed the whole kidney and the day he got home, I texted my childhood friend that he was home and he was doing okay. She couldn’t even take one second to respond “I’m glad your dad is okay?” That was it for me, I had to remove her on Facebook after she had to replied after a week, two weeks, etc. and I believe I deleted all messages on my cell phone, and I’m not sure what happened ! Then this “friend” of mine, never messages me on either Instagram  or Facebook. I think it began when I told her I asked out one of her friends a year ago (we are still friends, the girl I asked out), and from then she started not to respond to me. So, recently I told my friend who I asked out, about the communication between me and her friend. She told me that her friend, (who is also her roommate)  that they’re both extremely busy, which I understand, but and that “she” loves me, and doesn’t hate me (my friend who doesn’t respond, and not love in a boyfriend way.) But, if this is the case why doesn’t she communicate with me online? Even when I see her, she waved hi to me and we talk a bit, but it’s not the same. There were times in the past where she use to hug me a lot, any time she saw me. But something has changed with her and me, I can tell. I think my friend (the girl I asked out), is unaware of my “friend’s” (her roommates) , true feelings toward me, and I mean that in a bad way. I’m just not sure where I went wrong.... ",James5994.txt

0,"Hi. I'm new, and I'm not really sure where to start in the forums! I've been treated for depression since I was 17 years old, and then misdiagnosed with ADD when I was 17 and that started a downward spiral with abusing Ritalin (snorting about 5-10 times my dosage) for about 5 years. That's over with. I battled with anorexia as a direct result of the Ritalin, and got down to 95 lbs. Then I ballooned up to 185 lbs. I lost 45 lbs. a few years ago and I've kept it off ever since (I've never gone above 144). I've been on Prozac since I was 17, and just recently switched to Cymbalta at the suggestion of my psychiatrist. I felt funny on it, and committed the ultimate sin: I stopped taking my medicines a week ago. I know that's bad. The last two days have been a nightmare, and I even contemplated swallowing a bottle of pills at one point. My fiance is the most amazing person in the world, and I'm literally killing him with my sickness. I don't know what to do. I've been hysterically crying and inconsolable for about a week. Yesterday my fiance called the psychiatrist on-call with our medical program, and she said I needed to take the Cymbalta, so I did take one pill yesterday and again this morning. I do feel weird, though. At the center of it all is my weight gain; I gained about 10ish pounds (I weigh 140 at the moment), and NONE of my clothes fit me. I feel like a disgusting fat blob all of the time. Just one look in the mirror sets me off and I'm HYSTERICAL for the rest of the day. All I want to do is sleep. SLEEP and never wake up. I've had an eating disorder in the past, and I know I can't fall back into it (the anorexia was a direct result of the Ritalin), but I am just hysterical, depressed, and I feel disgusting all day long. My clothes don't fit and I feel fat and disgusting and horrible and I want to cry and rip out my hair. I'm thinking this weight has a LOT to do with my recent downward turn in my depression, but I just can't lose the weight. I work out constantly and follow a really healthy/strict eating plan, and nothing is working. I'm just reaching the end of my rope, here. And to top it all off: I'm getting married next month. I need help...I've called my psychiatrist, but I don't know what to do. I don't see a psychologist; I think I need to, but I've had bad experiences in the past. I think I just need help and guidance and a way to lose this weight and feel good about myself. Hoping this forum will help. ",mpj_e_2_b_1_xx.txt

0,"I kinda like being depressed after dealing with anxiety As a lot of people, I have both depression and anxiety disorders. Basically a thing happened in July, which caused me to have constant panic attacks and overall brutal anxiety until around October, when I just transitioned into deep depression. It was however a big relief. I was completely empty, I didn't care about anything. It was 100x better to me than fucking anxiety. When I'm depressed, I don't feel 'bad'. I don't feel good either, but I'm fine with that. I don't feel anything, it's kinda relaxing. The downside - when I was in the deepest state of depression I was really close to killing myself and I also threatened to shoot up the school, after which police took me to a mental hospital. I've been here for over 3 months now. I did some really bad things, I acted really bad, but on the inside I felt better. When I'm anxious I don't do mean things to people, but on the inside I'm dying, I feel vulnerable and just want help. I understand that depression is awful and people suffer from it, I see what it does to people on this sub. I just wanted to add my experience, since it's different to everyone else's. Anxiety makes me feel like I'm having a heart attack, like I'm going crazy, I sweat, I shake, it feels literally like torture. Depression is the exact opposite. It's calmness, not giving a shit about anything, basically relaxing. I feel kinda comfortable being depressed. I lie on the bed and look at the ceiling, at the wall, whatever. Like I'm on autopilot. Right now I have both, which just feels fucking weird, I can't even describe that. Sorry if I offended anyone. I know some people prefer to feel something, but I'm fine with being an empty shell. tl;dr - depression &gt; anxiety for me. ",Yelov.txt
0,"Medicines can and do stop working. I am going though this right now. I suffer from chronic depression. Had it since I was 5 and I am now 42 so I have been suffering for 37 years. God, I never realized how long it was! I sat in therapy for 4 years after my ex attempted to hang himself. I saved his life by taking him down from the noose with the help of my brother. The first words out of his mouth when he was out of his coma and the swelling went down was that it was all my fault. I knew then it was ME who needed the help. So for 4 years I sat in therapy and they never diagnosed me with chronic depression. If they did, they never told me or put me on medicines. When I switched therapists, that was when she said that I needed medicines. They gave me Prozac. That made a HUGE difference after the first 3 weeks. I took that for 6 years. Then I had gastric bypass surgery and when you have that, your body doesn't absorb the same so it stopped working. I took effexor for a while, did nothing, and now on celexa which is doing nothing at all. I am sitting here reading this forum and crying. So basically, medicines CAN stop working. Time to go get an adjustment. ",sadsoul_e_2_b_1_us.txt

0,"Crashing In Sorry this is long. I've been depressed since I was 15. First signs were at age 4.  I found pot and stayed high for 8 years. Clean and sober for 30 years, I never stopped having suicidal thoughts despite medication. So I tried to bury the pain in relationships, which didn't work either. I've been married three times in recovery. I had a daughter who I love very much, and we used to be very close.  She became a reason to live.  Then 4 years ago she didn't want to live with me 1/2 time any more. She became argumentative and we fought a lot.   Last year I found out she was accusing me of sexual abuse, with help from her mom ( first wife) and therapist, which is not true. The therapist never reported the abuse, and told daughter I have NPD, which also is not true.  So I got a guardian ad litem to investigate and found my daughter was suicidal, claiming PTSD because of the alleged molestation. The lawyer never helped my daughter, sparking a slide into deeper depression. My wife and parents didn't do much to try to help.  They got angry when I begged them to step in. Suidical ideation and inappropriate attention-getting threats became an actual plan, and a way to do it without leaving the stain of suicide. Then at work I made a $5 billion discovery that is extremely disruptive in the industry I work in. My quarter million dollar program found out millions are being spent on the wrong strategy. And 1/2 my team works on the other strategy at the same time as they are helping me, so they are taking steps to undermine the findings. Lately they gave up trying to block the discovery, and the fact that we can literally feed more people with no more land used for farming, by raising more animals (naturally) with the same amount of feed. I'm getting invited to speak globally about the discovery. The suicidal thoughts deepen, knowing the disruption to status quo is only beginning. Just before Christmas my third wife moved out, and I spent Christmas alone because my parents were sick. Last night she told my mom she intends to get a divorce. The medicine isn't working. The AA old timers are saying I'm depressed because I'm not working the steps correctly. I'm going to 2-3 meetings a day, most days. In two days I'm shutting down the case I opened to try to get help for my daughter. I can hardly work, because I can't complete thoughts very well any more, being so depressed. I've been complaining about feeling depressed and suicidal, because it's true, and it became a way to relate to the world, which makes people leave. The spiral is getting tighter, and it feels like a black hole is pulling me in. I can't imagine facing another divorce feeling this low. Mom said to get a roast beef out of the freezer and cook it with some potatoes and carrots and stop thinking about negative things. I went to Landmark and they say this is all just a story, and part of a racket I created to avoid responsibility. They say I can create something different by changing my story. I've tried a rainbow of medicine, and tomorrow I increase Latuda from 20 mg to 40, and keep the trintellex at 20, per MD. I can't do anything now because third wife will get 1/2, and parents are too old to deal with my belongings. My thoughts turn to seeing if I can find someone else who will love me anyway, or giving up. I want to give up but not really.  I really want to live, but I can't see any hope. And I can't stand the thought of being alone. Any help, hope or ideas would be appreciated.  Thank you. ",Karmaagnostic.txt
0,"I just need my spirit to settle In its totality it doesn't have to be about wins and loses,  or what I failed to do.  Neither does it have to be about my past years and the thoughts that come with immense feelings that appears to haunt me.  The behaviors and mentality that I have doesn't have to be the end all be all.  One major thing to include that its not about growth or conquering something in life.  I'm not living to grow or to become strong after a catastrophic situation.  I am looking for my spirit to simply just settle.  I'm not seeking any advice nor trying to raise my fist towards challenges.  I'm not seeking any of that just a settling of the inner me.  To me,  that is important than anything else because I would gladly be able to live with that when I one day be out of this earth. I'm not the goal oriented type.  Its not about climbing this ladder of life. I'm not here for any of what most people are striving for.  I seek for my spirit to settle for all these years.  That is what I'm chasing.  Most people are chasing dreams,  families,  success,  marriages,  money,  respect,  and fame,  but not this human.  More power to them and I'm sure they will obtain all those things but I for one am not seeking to obtain.  The human game is a serious thing filled with losses and wins.  I don't wanna count anymore nor try to get to the next level of life.  Cycling through the infinite regrets and regression. The only goal is for this spirit to settle some type of way.  I'm gunning for an internal calmness.  Something that can penetrate and flood the mind of mine.  Something that can provide some internal at ease like affect for myself.  So I say to my spirit,  I hope you settle. ",Alien24tb.txt

I remember when i was in school I had the best of the friends one can have and there used to be a great joy or some good feeling when we used to sit together in the play time and during lunch time etc etc.... then as I grew i still have friends but its kind of different probably i need to feel good for all my real professional friends but i kind of like the people who consider me their yar and take me for granted....any way i can change myself thus i too am bit professional( i donot know if this word suits here) when it comes to friendship...keep it simple....But then you miss that kind of a friend who is really reliable and the one who you can go anytime when you have a problem... but then i guess its time to live yourself that's to solve your own problems and have a peacefull life.... ,3710825.200406230.male.26.txt
1,"Conservative republican parents &amp; liberal arts educated democrat child...what could go wrong? I grew up in a poor household, but was able to use this to my advantage to get scholarships to private school and an elite liberal arts college. After graduating from school and coming back home, I realized that I have absolutely nothing in common with my parents anymore. They do not understand the concept of privilege, think everyone on welfare is lazy, voted for Trump and defend him and every time I get legitimately pissed off at them, they say that the school I went to brainwashed me and made me crazy and in doing so they completely invalidate all the hard work and effort I had to put in not only to get into this school, but working two jobs while there and still maintaining a 3.5 GPA. I was a sociology major, too, so these issues are literally what I spent most of my four years studying. It's now at the point where I cannot have a conversation with my father without it blowing up. It gets worse by the issue and the WORST part is that they are decent and loving people. Is there anyone else on here who is in a similar situation? What do you do? I'm slowly losing my mind trying to argue at this point. And moving out is the obvious solution, but I don't just want to run away from people who disagree with me and like, I don't pay rent.

1,"My first blog.. Man I used to wonder what a blog really is and now am blogging  ;o)  ... I am techie from india (I know nowadays being a techie from India is very dangerous) slogging out ... enjoying myself...But have some serious doubts about certain new things that I am discovering...  Quality  is a wonderful sounding word and my initiation into Project Management exposed me to a world of  jargons, metrics, templates and of course complete non-sense . I know that I may be chided for writing that, but let me clarify. On the set I am a devotee (right word) of the world of mathematics which never ceases to amaze me and Statistics, cos its just wonderful. During one of the great training days, it was conveyed, Statistics shouldn't be employed to misrepresent the data and now I wonder if it is the whole process is to do so. Information is available very abundantly and I guess we have surplus than we can consume. I wonder if generation of information is the basis of quality. Which comes to my first question ? Does adhering to quality standards mean ""keep your common sense @ home and come"". I wonder if the purists of statistics are the ones to satisfy. Cmon.. I wonder what possible information can be derived out of one's coffee breaks, one's mails and definitely the winner, How many lines of code I can dish out ? wonder if they know that I can eternally keep on putting braces, new lines, comments, star, hashes etc and they all contribute to code. Yeah Yeah I know, we have tools that can take care of these, but is this an indicator of a person's ability... Wonder what good is the information for... Begs the second question.. I get the common answer.. information may be useful down the line.. Yes it may be and may not be.. Going by the theory of probability it is equi-probable... I guess quality is used to ensure that the product being manufactured is in accordance with the best-practices in the industry (for starters) and more importantly, you learn from your current process to refine the same.. I think refinement is the catch and I guess it can be done in more than one way than generate some junk metrics..Wonder how the process can be refined from measuring no. of lines dished out in a day... Look forward to people's views... Hey feel free to drop in and drop a line... Hope this blog goes a long way... Time to hit off... ",3447776.200405250.male.26.txt
0,"I have been so depressed over a lost friendship. I have known this girl for about 5 years. We were very close or so I thought. We both had boys around the same age, went on vacations together with our families, and both went through our 2nd pregnancy together. I knew she was a person that had to have things her way but I accepted this. She has a large circle of friends that she included me in. I felt her family was mine, in a way. I am very shy and came out of my shell. Last year I got caught up with 2 other friends that were having problems. They really needed me. So I wasn't around much but I am always available if she needed me. Anyway, we got into a misunderstanding over something very minor. I really didn't think much about it the next day. That is the way I am. I get mad then I am over it within 24 hours. She is not like that. She holds grudges. I saw her the next day (4th of July) at her house. I knew she didn't really talk to me but she did have a lot of people there. Well,a couple of weeks after I call her saying ""Hey girl, can I pick land on up?"". She said ""How can you call and act like nothing is wrong?"" Then she hangs up on me. I wait until the next day and called again. First thing she says is ""What do you want?"" I say ""Just to be your friend."" She says ""We are no longer friends. There will be no more double dating with our husbands, vacations, you are to not come to my house, We are not friends"". I was blown away. I asked what I did and she couldn't give me a direct answer. She said we had different friends and I had more drama than any of her friends of 20 years. I asked her what drama? Last year I had some problems with my husband but I didn't really talk to her about that. She said  that was a problem, I didn't tell her things and that is what friends do. WHAT? She was contradicting herself. She hung up on me again. It is very difficult for me because when I make a friend and let them into my heart they are my friend for life. Her son is my son's best friend and her husband is my husbands best friend. I had recently told my husband to not mention their names around me because I become really depressed. My poor son doesn't understand why she doesn't like me anymore. How can I explain when I don't know. I bought her daughter a shirt about a month ago and she didn't acknowledge it until she saw me in Walmart a week later and we were face to face and she thanked me. It was very weird. I haven't seen her since July. I can't let my son have his friend over anymore because it hurts too much to see him and know that I am not welcomed in their home and they haven't asked my son over their house since all of this even though he still came over ours. I can't figure out what I did that was so bad. I wish I knew so that maybe I could at least defend myself and have some closure. ",wantstobehappy_e_2_b_c3f_us.txt

0,"Well, a little update then. For those who don't know me that well yet, (which is everybody I suppose) I'm the 20 (almost 21) year old that chose to take a break from school, due to pff what'll it be? Anxiety, depression, health problems regarding sleep/energy. I tried it again at some point, but after 2 weeks found myself to be, not cured yet. I figured it had to end, so I went looking for help. Social worker, well that's all nice and stuff, but not too helpful. Then the official psychiatrists. Well let's pick up from there; the first one, in the Adolescents department directed me to another shrink after the first intake meeting, my help question; not sure. But something was keeping me from being able to fit in the system. I also had concentration problems but she didn't want to dig into that. So this new shrink, on a different department, made me fill in some forms and we had some talks (2) and well, apparently the concentration problem IS a big issue and causing a lot of damage as well as my past (divorced parents, being bullied all my life etc etc.) Okay fine, so I says; maybe I need something to help me sleep? And she suggested I go see my house doctor and ask for sleeping medicines. Which I got, and used for two weeks now and ...nothing. Well, the first 2 days were good, the 2 after that were less good, and I don't even remember the ones after that. I woke up automatically, and sometimes sleep was okay. But after 2 weeks I'm still SO tired everyday, it's killing me. I try and keep up a new rhythm, but it's so exhausting and I feel like doing all sorts of happy things but I just don't have the energy and then I go do it anyway and I end up so hurt and tired. Now, I can't take the medicines for more than two weeks, so today was going to be my last. Well, I sort of should have read the booklet I got with it before use. It said I shouldn't take them EVERY day but every other day, and like I don't know, it says it builds up and stays in your body. Well, I'm fine don't worry. They warned about some side effects, but I seem to have been okay. However, the side effects include ALL the things I already suffered from BEFORE even taking the darn medicines!!! So it's been a complete and utter waste. This one day, I tried sleeping without medicines, and I just couldn't...just, can't fall asleep. So yeah, I had that talk with yet another shrink today, and now he wants me to see some other person. And he thinks I SHOULDN'T take sleeping medicines. So like, ARGH, people keep telling me opposite things, and now they want me to see this person, who'll help me fill in my days and get organized??? That's all cool and well and all, but I got there myself already. I figured it all out before I even started seeing these ""professionals"" and now they're telling me what I already came up with on my own??? It's another 3 week wait. And I don't know anymore. I'm confused about all this, and beginning to think it's been a huge mistake in the first place. And now that it's Spring again, I'm feeling sort of happy. So depression is still here, but, I don't notice it much...or do I? I'm still feeling so alone and my family still doesn't get me...I just want out, I just want to be away from here, which brings us back to the original problem. I'm so annoyed, and after this, today is just going to be another day that I just don't do anything useful... Sure I want to go back to school, but it takes time...I have some time, then again I don't... I had so many plans, and ARGH this sleeping problem, which is going to be my main focus now, is just so darn annoying. I could listen to countless pieces of advice, but in the end, it's just no good to me... Even the stupid sleeping medicines don't work...And every time I go see a shrink about one problem, they point me to someone else, and then another problem bothers me and they send me back but that still didn't fix my first problem. I'm like, fine I'll go fix this darn problem myself then. (I really feel like cursing, but I won't because it's not proper so I'll release some rage when I'm done here, but just know that I'm really upset and annoyed). After all, it was me who had to fix everything all my life right? So I might as well start now... haha such a laugh, I'll procrastinate till the day I die... So very tired. I can't do a thing... ugh, I'm so sick of it. I want to go sleep now, but I just know I'll wake up late in the evening and won't be able to sleep tonight.

0,"Opened up to a ""friend"" about my depression. It could've gone better. Hello, Reddit. I've never posted here before. I'm a bit nervous about sharing this story (I'm very shy, even anonymously), so I want to thank you in advance for taking the time to read it. I'm hoping that just getting it off my chest will help, even if only a little. Also, I'm sorry if this post rambles on a bit or is incoherent at all, I'm not in the best state of mind at the moment. Earlier today, during our school's lunch break, I opened up to somebody I trusted about my depression and anxiety. I've been on a steep downward spiral recently, and this person had taken notice that something was wrong. She sat me down, grabbed us a couple of sodas, and told me to spill my guts. Normally, I would have simply told her that everything was fine, and made some lame excuse like ""I didn't sleep well last night"" or ""I'm just worried about my exam scores"". But this was the first time that anybody had ever reached out to try and help, so I decided to be truthful. I thanked her for offering to listen, and explained that I had never shared this with anybody else, so I might struggle to fully express myself. She was understanding, and told me to take as much time as I needed. I was very careful not to unload everything on her, I basically told her exactly what I said at the start of this post: that I struggle with depression and anxiety, and that it's been getting a lot worse recently. Initially, it seemed like it was going well. She had several follow-up questions, some of which I wasn't entirely comfortable answering. However, for the first time in years I felt a genuine sense of hope, and felt like someone actually cared about me, so I answered them anyway. Eventually, she asked me what was causing all of this. I explained that while there are certainly things that contribute to my depression on a day-to-day basis, at the root of it, there isn't really a reason. It's just who I am, almost as if it's hardwired into my brain. It's hard to explain. Do any of you understand what I'm talking about? Anyway, this is where things took a turn. While I was trying to explain that, she stopped me and said: ""I'm sorry, I can't do this. I offered to help cause I thought you were just having girl problems, or school problems, or something. I didn't realize you were totally emo. We're not in high school anymore. Besides, you're a guy, just toughen up"". That last part stung. I knew that was a common sentiment in our society, but to hear it coming from her, someone I've been friends with since high school, really took me by surprise. I didn't know what to say, so I didn't say anything. I just kind of looked down at my lap. We sat quietly for a moment, until she got up and started gathering her things. As she started to walk away I said: ""I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable, I wasn't trying to do that."" She looked back at me and said: ""Look, a big reason I'm friends with you is because of your positive attitude. It's infectious, and I love that about you. But if that's really just a mask, then you should probably just keep the mask on if we're going to continue being friends."", and then she left. She texted me a few hours later and said: ""I hope you're able to move past your issues so our friendship can move forward"". I haven't responded, and don't plan to. I cry myself to sleep at night enough as it is without also worrying about maintaining a fake personality for her. I probably won't be opening up to anyone like that again anytime soon (except, of course, to all of you wonderful people on the internet). Deep down, I know that most of the people in my life wouldn't react the way she did. But I just don't think I can build up the motivation to try it, not when I struggle just to get up in the morning. I want to thank you all again. Not just for reading my story, but for being a part of this community. Depression and anxiety really suck, and nobody should have to suffer through them alone. ...I'm gonna go hug my pillow now. ",SpaceNerd42.txt

I have taken antidepressants off and on for a few years but stopped this summer because my husband and I were trying to conceive.  My pregnancy has been pretty rough this time around ... (I have an 8 year old son).  I've had joint problems, severe morning sickness ... and terrible depression / anxiety.  My husband just doesn't understand what I'm going through ... he thinks that I'm being hateful or sad on purpose.  He contributes to a lot of the way that I feel.  He told me early in the pregnancy, that if something was to happen and I lose the baby or it was born with something wrong with it, he would have a hard time not blaming me for it even if the doctor said that nothing could have prevented it.  This was said to me because I wasn't taking my prenatal vitamins at the time because of the morning sickness.  I could see if I were using drugs or drinking but I do not do those things.  I don't understand his thinking on that subject. My mother in law is another person getting on my nerves.  She comes over uninvited and gives out unwanted advice.  She also has a way of making me angry with her thoughtless comments which are hurtful and unnecessary.  I can't talk to my husband about this because he would see me as the ""bad guy"".  Sometimes I just want to be alone ... away from people ... I feel like I don't have any privacy anymore.  My husband always makes me feel worse when I talk to him about how I feel.

0,"Falling for someone you have no chance to be with Warning: Super long read Have you ever fallen for someone that you know you have absolutely no chance with? It’s been 4 years since I’ve fallen for a girl back in college, which ended up in heartbreak and depression because she already found someone else. I’ve lost all motivations and my passion for arts (I’m an art student), failed my thesis which sent me into another dark place, ’friends’ were not even there to help me get up, and for the remaining years I had in college, the thing that kept me going are my parents, I just wanted to survive for them. I’ve lost all emotions, the flame that was once burning in my heart, the excitement I had when I was a freshman. I graduated college 7 months ago and found work not related to the course I took up, it felt really low, but I just wanted to survive. Training for work now, didn’t want to make friends again, had one, but he didn’t liked the people so he left in a few weeks, the only thing in my mind was to focus and be better for this job to survive. Avoided lunch and hanging out with workmates, and didn’t really reveal much about myself aside from having a mundane life. The trainers were aware of my introversion and decided to have random sitting arrangements every week so we could get to know our workmates more, and I could get to talk about other stuff aside from work. 3 weeks in training and still, I didn’t made any connections, I only help out my workmates professionally, point out mistakes and the next step they should take. I get to be sit mates with the liveliest girl in training, playful and have a contagious ’happy’ aura(?). There were also a few talks and laughs about work related stuff, but I didn’t really made efforts to start it, she was always the one that engages first (and that’s because she’s an extrovert and does this to everyone anyways). Being around her, hearing her voice, seeing her smile felt something, it felt like the flame that I lost 4 years ago came back. But, what made me fell the most is that she’s intelligent as well and speaks in English flawlessly (I live in a country outside US). I can also relate to her because she suffers from clinical depression and requires therapy sessions every now and then (everyone in training knows this anyways because she told the class from the get-go). I didn’t really asked her out for lunch or coffee, I really wanted to so I could get to know her better and be friends with her, be her guide in her darkest days, but my introversion and over thinking always gets the best of me. There were only a few times she joined me and my friend during a coffee break where I found out a few things about her. There were times that I see the sadness beyond her smile, and times where her depression was clearly visible and affected me greatly. I always think about scenarios - if the conditions were right - where I get to talk with her and lend a helping hand, at the end of the day they only remain as thoughts. I know she doesn’t think about me like how I think about her. Every time our shift ends, I leave the office quickly and ignore the feelings I have for her, my mind is at a constant battle on whether or not to ask her for lunch, ask her if she’s ok. It’s even worse at night, whenever I see her late night tweets about her depression, a part of me just wants to be there for her, and the other part gives me the realization of how pathetic I am and that I don’t deserve her. I know that she had an ex-bf that broke her heart, and currently has a gf (she’s bi). Yet, she still gives me inspiration in every photo I take. I really don’t know what is wrong with me, I’m being tormented by my own mind and I still like it. Knowing that she already has someone in her heart, yet still seeing her depressed at times (and looking at her tweets), really makes me want to step up and do something, but held back by my own tormented soul. Next week would be the last week in training, after that we’re going to get split up into teams and do actual work, but still go back to class to share our experience and reflect upon them. One could only hope for a miracle that I gain the strength and courage to talk to her more and be a part of her life. I really hate this feeling, yet this pain fuels my passion even more.

No one has ever known that I've thought of suicide except when I was in junior high and it wasn't really much true, sure a little but I was more agreeing with my cousin when she said that she has thought of such. Now I've been recently noticing (for a small bit months now) how I have been having some I guess you would say symptoms (pardon my spelling) of depression and all. Especially I've been losing interest in things and feeling guilty over everything and that's the most extreme ones, I have some others too. I've taken online tests and it says that I may have depression. But I can't believe I do. I mean why would I have depression. I would just guess I'm making it up to myself or something. We'll I've always been interesting in  psychology stuff like personality disorders, so maybe I'm just reading into it wrong or something. That would probably be what a shrink would say so I don't want to go to one, plus I don't really like talking to them. Another thing is one of my friends just attempted suicide, lucky survived and if I say something to someone they would think I'm just saying such because of that. I've felt like this before that though .... another thing is I'm a Christian and Christians shouldn't feel this way, right? Can someone help me figure out if I'm just making this up in my head!!!

1,"Asian parents, jealousy, what to do? Hello I am an asian american son trying to help out my family. My family from Vietnam moved here 5 months ago and have been living together with my Mom and Dad. I no longer live at home, and couldn't live at home if I wanted to because of the space and my relatives here for the first time to America, which is fine with me. I recently found out about drama going on at home, it involves my mom and dad and my female cousin. About one ago before my relatives moved here from vietnam, something had happen to my great aunt , she had given advice to my mom about being careful about her husband and any woman in the house. What had happen to my great aunt was, she caught her husband trying to cheat with her niece. I'm not sure if they actually had an affair or whatnot, but just warning her to be careful about this type of situation in the house. I really feel like it was unfair for my great aunt to put these thoughts in my mom's head because why do that? Especially when they are about to come and move in and start a new life in America. So back to the drama, my dad has been super stress out calling me, telling me that he is unable to handle the situation anymore. He said my mom thinks he is looking at my female cousin in a inappropriate way. She happens to be 19 years old. My dad just thinks this is crazy, he works 2 jobs (15 hours a day) trying to pay mortgage and pay all the bills. My mom doesn't work and stays home. My dad has been calling me saying he only is able to sleep 4 hours a night because every time he comes home from work, my mom is always giving him a ear full, and hes to the point where he can't take it anymore and thinking about just continuing to pay the bills and living somewhere else. I tried to talk to my mom and want to be completely open minded about the situation, she just tells me that I dont know, and she can tell the way he acts at home. Her reasoning is, she just can tell by the way he looks at her. She said she knows that he won't ever take it that far by cheating, but its her being jealous which is causing all this drama. In the house consist of my female cousin, male cousin, aunt and uncle. Also my other aunt and uncle and my mom and dad. its a pretty full house, and my parents have been arguing every other night. My aunt called me tonight trying to keep the peace in the house and calm down both sides. My female cousin and her family has no idea this is going on. But most likely suspect something because of the arguing between my parents and im afraid they will find out whats going on soon enough, which will be really embarrassing. I feel like my mom and dad need marriage counseling, or my mom needs to see a therapist, but being asian they don't believe in these types of counseling classes and will be very hard to get my mom to agree to do something like this. --- **tl;dr**: What can I do to help out my family? I'm not trying to take sides but I really don't think my dad would ever cheat on my mom. Every time I try to talk some sense Into my mom, she always ends up getting mad, and saying everyone thinks I'm crazy but I'm not. They have been married for 30 years and my dad has always worked two jobs his entire life to make sure all the bills are paid, that we have food and shelter. ",ChilliMcChill.txt
1,"So I have to be in this wedding in September.  I am trying to convince my friend Peter M to escort me to this wedding, but so far he will not commit to it.  My Hubby is going to be out of town on a camping trip so I am going to have to go solo if Peter doesn't go.  It is a Bolivian/Irish wedding.  The bride is about 5'2"" and the groom is about 6'4"", plus the groom looks about as Irish as Irish can get complete with red hair and freckles and the Bride looks truly Bolivian.  They are quite an interesting couple to see.   So the problem is that the only people I will know at the entire wedding are the bride, groom and bride's mother.  Most of the people on the bride's side are from Bolivia and speak very little English.  I know that this sounds like a very fun event, but if Peter M was the good friend that he says he is he would come and escort me ; )  Oh, here is the interesting thing:  The groom has multiple piercings.  Including his penis and testicles.  I am all okay with the piercing thing and everything, but I can't help but thinking the ding-a-ling piercing has got to hurt.  Oh and he did them all himself.  I asked the bride to be if urine and other bodily fluids leak out the other holes and she confirmed that they did.  Dude, that means his dick is like a freaking colander!  That is a bit strange to me.  I would be afraid to have sex with him (not that I would want to anyway), for fear that some parts of his penis rings would come off inside of me and then have to be located.  Okay that would be just TOO CREEPY!  Okay enough rambling about nothing, anyway my daughter is crying and my husband is ignoring her. ",4239258.200408190.female.27.txt

1,"Hello world!   Yes, well... umm... I've just started this journal, as you could probably tell, and I'm aiming to use it to record life as it is now for me. As for most journals, I haven't put this online to 'show it off' per say- I'm using Blogger because it's very accessible and so I can come back to memories and thoughts that I might well have forgotten in years to come. However, comments and everything are very welcome!   I hope that I'll be welcomed here well enough- I'm currently working on a layout of some kind that might come sooner or later... We'll have to wait and see!   Well, I suppose that first journal entries include a bit about the journaler, so I'll introduce myself, shall I? My name is Jennifer, but on the internet I go by the alias of Myth, I'm currently 16 and studying in 11th grade at a school in Brisbane, Australia. I'm more of a nerd than not, I guess you can say, but that's mainly because I need to study really hard to get where I want in life (in terms of a career) as I would like to become a physiotherapist, but I'm quite good at a variety of different things- I can write stories and poetry, draw to some extent and even defend myself, as I learn a martial art called  Ju Jitsu . My parents are separated, but I see them both equally, so it isn't that bad a deal, and I have two brothers- one twin brother and one half brother, who's currently six. He (the latter) is really cute, but he's also terribly annoying and (in m opinion) a little spoilt.   I like to RP (RolePlay), mainly the online kind, so you can often find me in the RP sections of forums, or MUSHing on sites like  Elendor , but most of my time is lately spent in study or at Ju Jitsu training, which is really very fun, despite all the bruises.   Well, that's about all I can think of at the moment, so I'll be off and I'll post sometime later! I plan to try a very different style of journal writing, so I'll see what I can come up with!

Well a week ago I worked up the courage to ask her out on a date, and this Saturday we went on one. It was great. We went to a small local coffee shop and sat there and just talked for almost 3 hours. It was seriously such a good time. On the way out I asked if she'd like to do it again and she said yes. Awesome! Later that night I get a text... she doesn't think it will work out in the long run. I ask her why and she says we both have very different plans with our future, she's still getting over another break up, etc... Well that sucks, but I understand.

0,"Failure to trust ‘’those on my side’’. [possible trigger Warning] I find myself incapable of trusting my spouse. I’ve been with my SO for nearly 15 years, 7 married this year, we have 3 children. Before I hit my mid-teens I’d been through nearly a decade of sexual abuse within the already dysfunctional household I grew up one, with an alcoholic father and a narcissistic mother. I met my now spouse when I was 17. He had been in a two year relationship with a girl a few years his senior, which left him broken after her infidelity. And I… well I lived day to day, carrying what I could. I’ll never forgot how I coldly and factually told him with a mere two sentences what I had to endure, telling him that if he did chose me, he would be settling for a lifetime shared with a woman with severe ups and downs due to her limited mental strength. He convinced me to go for it and I wept in his arms. That was probably the first time in my life someone did not look the other way and I allowed myself to be vulnerable, instead of distant and cold. I opened myself up to him. Few years later my home situation imploded. I ran. His mother took me under her wing, I think she was the first parental figure I could lean on in my life. His father loathed me as the girl from the slums, threatening me in private to never marry his son. Reminding me of my lowly descent when he could. He would never come to accept me fully but at least fully respects me in public, which to me is commendable enough. Afterwards I started living with my now SO, still during our teens in a studio. The idea was triggered and pushed for by me as a solution after a bout of infidelity on his side after he moved to study in a city a couple hours away. He partook in intimate relations with a girl he knew from another country over webcam due to ‘’loneliness’’ and held the act in the same regards as watching porn whereas I didn’t. We tried to work things out. As we did my view of him started to crumble, but was rebuilt after living together surprisingly worked remarkably well. We grew more towards each other and were best friends on top of lovers. In between this life changing chapter and where I am now, he has had a few strikes I simply can not forget. While I was once open to share my ups and downs and sadness with him, now I’d rather not. Because where I once trusted him to hold me, I now trust him to ridicule me and tell me to man the fuck up. And the stubborn ass I am, I do, but this comes with resentment. But to explain the strikes: - One is where I was crying after having particularly bad and involuntary memories. Annoyed by my state and stressed by upcoming finals he asked me: When is this going to end? You’re always spinning the same old tales, you’re driving yourself insane. - Another was when he screamed out while we had visitors: How would you like it if I told everyone you were raped? He believed I had done something utterly despicable, blame was pinned upon me by one of his siblings. In that moment something broke, the attack was 100% unwarranted. So much trust lost. When he figured out I had done nothing to him the apologies came swift and numerous. - One was when I asked him for a letter. He will always buy flowers on special occasions, which I hate. They wither and die. I just hate the sentiment, I dislike it and I have communicated this. I wanted something which lasts. A reminder. All I wanted was a letter. Years I secretly yearned for one but received flowers instead, which I still tended to. Finally… I asked for a letter. He refused and told me point blank to my face he would not. That it was silly I needed something to hold onto, and that this item would become something of an unhealthy obsession. - The latest strike was after I endured a panic attack while I was on my own, which I managed myself before he returned home. He was upset when I confided in him and he stated: I will not be on your side if you are mentally ill. I will choose our children and make sure they grow up with stability. (Later he corrected himself and stated that if I was to turn schizophrenic or manic, he would have me committed and divorce me, but would support me through depression and anxiety). Now to me a panic attack is something manageable if you are equipped to deal with it. Through the years I have learned to be aware of my surroundings and triggers and to be prepared to deal with anything since I am responsible for my children. I have no history of hysterical or erratic behavior, so I found his reaction to my first ever panic attack very… crude. I have my pride even through my depression for what I have survived and what I have accomplished. But I hate that I can not find it in myself again to open up towards my spouse and more than often find myself crying when I am capable to, so I can put up my smile and brave face when I NEED to. I’ve successfully faked it till I made it. And of the 15 years that we have been together the good by far outweighs the bad, something which can not be conveyed well enough in this post. But what has been said can be never taken back. Even though recently he said: Don't you understand after 15 years I am on your side? I understand. I hate that I can’t be vulnerable anymore. I hate that the trust is gone, and the resentment grows. If anyone has advice or a similar story of lost trust, I’d just love to hear and talk about it, if only to gain some perspective.

0,"I just really need to vent... For a start, I understand everyone in life are at different levels and that depression and anxiety is different for everyone and I am in no way stating who has it worst or better. I’ve taken hours and hours of training in it and I’m not here to speak or preach about how to help.. In a rare occasion in my life I’m asking for help, guidance, I don’t know the correct word but maybe if I explain myself a bit it may help. This maybe long and I do apologize but I just need to say all of this SOMEWHERE... I’m gay guy that recently moved from a conservative town in Montana to the amazing city of Portland, OR. I came out of the closet the summer going into my freshman year of high school, dealt with a (simply put) shitty childhood while growing up in the Bible Belt of northern Florida, with an abusive father and worrying, even at the age of 7/8 about how my future would play out in this. My mom divorced and remarried a man that doesn’t accept my sexuality personally but supports my life decision  and says he loves me. We moved to Montana (my mom, me and him) and I began to feel like I did have a purpose when I was introduced to acting onstage at a local theatre that I fell in love with. Life, for a few years, was amazing but my high school at the time was having a crisis. Unfortunately four students had committed suicide between my freshman and junior year and, with the help of many, started a suicide awareness program in the city and lead that for a year or so. My senior year, literally three days before it started, my military brother committed suicide on base, it was suspected it was also his sexuality. But also in my senior year, near the end of it, I met a man whom I fell in love with (which is what I am getting too, just bare with me). We were able to spend a lot of time together for a month or two before he had to leave to Portland (before I had gone) for a work internship where he would go back home to Brazil once completed. He treats me like gold, and I really mean that, he has been nothing but amazing to me. He flew me out to Portland so I could visit him for two weeks where we fell even more in love. Everything was shattered when he left for home and I also left for an adventure. After I graduated, I had the amazing opportunity to go to the BEAUTIFUL island of Taiwan, where I spent an amazing year learning Chinese (Mandarin), meeting people all around the world, experiencing a new culture for the first time, it was indeed a life changing time for me. But it wasn’t easy for my boyfriend and I. We fought in occasion, texting makes it really hard to communicate emotions, and we only had about two hours out of our days to talk due to the harsh time zone differences. The year went by quite quickly and he surprised me with yet another plane ticket to Portland where he would also land only two hours after I did and we would be together again. It was only for two weeks again but I felt complete... He even proposed on the Fourth of July. He was yanked away from me again soon after and it tore me down. My heart crumbled. My next chapter in life had started once I arrived back from Taiwan and had seen my boyfriend again. I had decided I wanted to move to a Portland permanently, found a decent student housing apartment, enrolled for school, I was excited... now this is where things become a bit much for me and why I’m here today. My, now fiancé, was able to stay with me for a full month this time. Now at this point I’m sure you wonder (if you are still reading), “why doesn’t he move here?,” or “why don’t you move there?” Here’s why: He was on an exchange program when I met him that the Brazilian government paid for. The requirement for that visa is that he must stay in Brazil for two years before he can legally move back into the USA. In other words, he is stuck there while I’m stuck here both separated and both in fear of him being rejected. We applied for the fiancé visa and now we are waiting for the approval. I refuse to move where he lives because of how high the crime rate is and due to Brazil’s economic status, we both agreed it would not be good for a white American target to live in a high crime area. I know I have talked a lot about my fiancé but here is also what is going on on my hands as well that I just was not ready for. Before I moved to Portland, I had to go to urgent care because I had no primary doctor and no money, only Medicaid, which they took. I went three times for small bumps on my hands that turned out to be stressed induced and all three times I went the doctors said “I have no idea! Try using lotions and see what happens!” Nodded their heads and left. Very pointless but when I got the bill I was shocked and confused. I thought my Medicaid had covered it, which it did not because while I was out of country my Medicaid had expired and no one told me about it, therefore I was left with a $600 bill. I heard it off for a while because I had other things to deal with than the bullshit that the hospital was giving me about it. Around this time as well, I moved in with my best friend due to a dispute I had with my parents, which really crumbled me, but they still don’t know how upset I am about it. I moved to Portland... and now I believe I’m regretting it... I moved with that same best friend where we would also share the space with two others, a couple from Hawaii. We had Skyped then ahead of time in our excitement of moving and we were all excited to meet each other. I had a job lined up for me as a barista, I had a savings plan lined up for what I could and couldn’t spend for money, school would be starting soon, things were looking pretty nice! Well... it’s not nice. Not nice at all. The Hawaiian couple does not like my friend and I. They stop our oven mittens and tried to say they were there’s and hid them from us, refused to let us use the garbage can in the kitchen, and held little meetings about what it is we were doing wrong and how we could fix it.. I was so thrown back I ignore them at any chance and even had to take time out of my life to tell them how upsetting it is we had reached a level where they had to actually put sticky notes on things we could touch and could not touch. I find myself to be quite tidy and clean and fair but I guess there are two sides of the story always. That’s the first thing. That job I had lined up as a barista? Big joke... I met with the boss who said the store isn’t open yet and asked if I wanted to be a cashier for the university instead. I said why not, the pay was amazing at $12.75 an hour and had benefits. I did my on-boarding and was quite interested. First day on the job however they lied and put me in food service where I was demanded around by two chefs and four managers who didn’t know what the fuck they were doing. One of the chef’s actually spilt boiling grease on my foot and didn’t even apologize. The other chef was racist and talked bad about the Indian workers so much I had to leave his presence. It was a toxic environment. Income tax in Oregon was so high I wasn’t able to afford my apartment and realized I need to be working minimum wage to sincerely support myself here. I left after a month and am now struggling on finding a full time again. On a side note, because of costs and issues with finding a co-signed for a loan, I had to pull my enrollment for school as well. That’s the second.. When my fiancé came to visit me for a month, my best friend/roommate was very difficult... it’s a harsh word to use but she has a lot of learning to do. I have been on my own since I was 16 in doing things myself (with the exception of paying my phone bill and buying a car). Taxes, jobs, appointments, etc., were all me. She needs some help getting there and she has done and amazing job to get there but... every opportunity I hand her to take one more step of becoming independent she rejects and shuts down completely. The whole month was very hard for my fiancé and I over how jealous and upset she got and it was too much. Currently she is back home for Christmas and I am alone and quite frankly I needed it. I just don’t know how to handle that situation. It was as if she was using her emotions against me and it was poisonous. It go so bad my fiancé and Igor an Airbnb our last two nights together so it could just be me and him. That’s the third.. I had to go to the emergency room as well when my fiancé was here due to yet another kidney stone. I got one in the 7th grade, near the end of my exchange program and one in a restaurant where the pain was so bad I needed to call an ambulance... more money on shit I can’t afford. I can go on and on with these stories but I need to get to this... it’s my anxiety. I was diagnosed with depression in high school but was taken off of medication. I was doing actually quite well! But most recently, with everything that’s been going on, it’s gotten really really bad. I am constantly anxed about everything.. when I walk down the street, I fear what people look at me as. Now I’m not fat, I’d say I’m average but my cheeks are so puffy and it really embarrasses me to even look in a mirror. I am constantly wondering why my fiancé wants to be with me, if he is cheating on me, lied to me, etc. I over stress about the smallest smallest things. Example: I cried and broke down because I failed my drivers test for the Oregon license. I physically felt like I was going to die or the end of the world was happening... why? Why was that happening to me? Why is this ALL happening to me? I miss my fiancé, I can’t get stable, I now starting out as an adult isn’t supposed to be easy but guys... this is really hard. I spend any day I have off in bed and I have only had one meal within two days. I know I need help but I don’t have the money for it or the time. I have never felt this insecure about my life, future, body, everything. I feel like I’m climbing up an escalator that’s going the wrong way, and no amount of running will get me to the top. I don’t know where else to go or who to talk to. I feel like I’ve annoyed everyone already enough about me that I no longer want to talk to literally anyone. My fiancé sometimes even. Well if you’ve made it this far I thank you sincerely... I just really needed to vent. ",aaron_nels.txt

0,"The only thing I do is hurt people and say dumb things when I'm mad (really I'm so mad at myself and hate myself so much it seeps out towards others). I know that makes me a very ugly and hateful person. I don't know how to deal with this anymore. This last year has been the worst (mood problem - wise). I used to have longer periods of relative normalcy in between episodes, but they seem to be happening more frequently this past year. It's too much to deal with. I am getting treatment and seeing a doctor, but nothing seems to work that great for me. My doctor probably thinks I'm faking it all at this point. I don't really think she has experience treating anything but very mild depression or anxiety. I feel so low right now. I just don't know or care anymore. What do I do? ",missy4477_e_2_a_c3p_us.txt
