0,"Up, down, up, down, up, down. I can deal with being sad and depressed, but it's the false sense of hope and happiness before getting kicked in the dirt again that kills me. I can't be happy or satisfied anymore, I know it won't stay. ",IJ3tI.txt
1,"Need honest opinions on my living situation. So about 6 months ago, my father had an accident which left him disabled. He lived in a 1 story ranch home. Being the only child that would be able to take care of my Dad, I moved my husband and 2 children to my dads house. Our house needed so much work, we wanted to sell it anyways, his house being 1 level worked so much better for him, allowed him to get around easier. So my father has gotten a little better, can take care of himself in the bathroom, needs helps with cleaning, cooking etc. also can’t drive. We are still living with my dad. The living situation has really worked out for us all. I am a stay at home mom, so taking care of my dad and 2 children is very much manageable. My husband and I do have our own space in the house as well. Sooo can someone please tell me why I’m so embarrassed to tell people of our living situation? Everyone knows what happened to my dad, everyone knows he needs me but I sort of feel like a failure. I guess because we don’t own our own house. We have done so much work and updating to my fathers house to make it our own. We pay almost all of the bills too. I love that we are all together I’m just sick of telling the whole story of how my dad got hurt and why I had to move in with him and why we don’t own our own house. My husband and I want to add an addition onto the house, we just renovated and finished the basement. We are happy, I just can’t get over being embarrassed. Thoughts y’all?! ",Kmar92.txt
0,My parents only having expectations for me to succeed just makes me feel like the biggest failure of my brothers. Which not only is bullshit but also makes me just not try in the first place a lot of the time. Because if I try and fail its worse because I’m expected to succeed. I don’t even understand why they expect me to be the successful one. I barely got acceptable grades in high school until senior year when I just took easy courses. I failed English and nearly failed Spanish in 9th grade because I was too lazy to put in any effort. I barely ever brought home friends or did extracurricular activities most of high school. But for some reason I’m their grand vision for who’s gonna make the family proud. ,frozencrazytuna.txt

0,"I just wrote a really long entry, but because the school computer can't seem to handle using the whole categories thing on WordPress, I'm having to start over. Today is my final day of school for this semester.  I have one more �exam� to go. It's in Advanced Comp.  We get to write persuasive essays.  I'm really good at those, so I'm not really worried.  I had my Art of Interviewing test today, and I'm worried about the matching section of the test.  I got a bit confused on it.  It was easy stuff, but my little brain just couldn't seem to process it. I wrote another long entry a week or so ago, but I lost it too.  In it, I ranted about a �friend� of mine. I don't like her, but she thinks we're really close.  She uses me and expects me to do things for her.  She presumes that I can just do whatever she wants for some reason that it unbeknownst to me.  I'm just sick of doing things with her and for her.  I want to tell her to just go away, but she probably wouldn't listen.  I made it perfectly clear that being touched pisses me off, and what does she do?  She touches me.  I just want to, at the very least, slap her.  I don't get why she has to touch me.  What on earth does she gain by touching me?  Maybe she's just forgetful, but why does she forget that, but she doesn't forget that I can type really fast? It's supposed to be stormy today, which I hate.  As I have stated many times before, I don't like stormy weather.  Hell, I'm afraid of stormy weather.  I like to be in my house where I feel more safe. I really don't feel safe at A&M since it seems to be a target for severe weather. I need to waste another twenty minutes before I leave to go to my final exam. I guess I can just keep typing, can't I? I mean, I have several weeks worth of crap that I can talk about.  Actually, I don't really have that much to say. I've worked on family history stuff, which is pretty neat.  I know that that's dorky to say, but it is nice to know where my family comes from.  I had a friend once who said that only Americans seem to care about their heritage, but I don't think that that's true.  If other cultures didn't care about their heritage, then they wouldn't keep information about it.  It would just be dust in the wind. I've replaced my Hayden Christensen obsession with an obsession on Eric Balfour.  He's Brian on Conviction and played Gabe on Six Feet Under, as well as Jesse (Xander's friend in the first episode) on Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  (He was also in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.)  I've gotten his band's CD (Fredalba's Uptown Music for Downtown Kids).  I've also bought a movie he was in (Lie with Me).  Both are pretty good.  The movie definitely isn't for younger audiences. I no longer have Gulshan as my therapist. I wasn't going to have her anymore because I have Medicare. I was going to leave her yesterday. I'm just sick of her. I tried to leave once before and she asked for a second chance. I gave her a second chance, and yesterday, she said that that never happened. Why would I lie about that? She asked for another chance yesterday before she realized that the Medicare would keep her from being my therapist anyway. I now have an LCSW for a therapist. That should be interesting. I should probably go. I hope that I actually get this entry to show up. ",Janet_e_2_a_1_us.txt
0,"I'm brand-new here at these forums. I've come to you all to seek guidance/wisdom from any of you who has suffered or is currently suffering from depression. Within the past 3 years I have struggled on and off with this disease. For the most part I've had it under control, until relatively recently. About four months ago I was drastically descending downwards mental health wise. The result of this declination helped obstruct all aspects of my social life, causing an abrupt, painful end to many friendships I endeared. Also my negative behavior started to poison. The equilibrium that my family and I shared. The result of all this lead not only to my choice of isolation , but even if I chose not to isolate myself, I still had damaged relationships so much, that any attempts to make amends, and or repair former friendships, were futile. I basically pushed and alienated myself from everything I held dearest. Anyways, one day I just snapped; my ability to process information, perform simple math equations, remember things I had JUST thought of seconds before, concentrate, quick wit, and confident decision making had all been impaired immensely. Previously, before all of this, I was an ""A"" Honor Role student and had no difficulty functioning efficiently in my ""AP"" classes, but now I can barely sustain a low ""B"" average. Has anyone experienced this lack of cognition? If so, do you know if it will go away? Its driving me insane! ",Mr.T_e_1_a_1_xx.txt
0,"Hi all, I've just registered here... I've been depressed for quite a while, my dad died when I was 7 and my best friend died when we were 18. After the death of my father I was in counseling, but my counselor stopped coming to school to see me and I don't think I ever got anywhere from it. I'm currently 23, almost 24 (and male, from the UK for those keeping count) I've felt crap for ages... I hate my job, and doing that along with the stress of my final year of university sent me on a downward spiral. I would worry so much about my workload, but have no motivation to do it and get out of the situation. I hate being single, but can't find someone special who likes me, who I like back. I want to leave my job, but I can't afford to until I leave university and get a job doing something I want to. I had thought about suicide, but I know the pain of losing people close to me, and I couldn't inflict that pain on someone else. I considered cutting myself too. I thought that maybe if I was hurt, I could get extra time for university work, and maybe someone would help me. But I realized that I shouldn't do that, and should see someone about it. I also didn't have the balls to do it. I think bad thoughts a lot but I don't think I could go through with them. I was worried about going to the doctor though. My previous experience with a counselor has put me off them, and I don't like talking to strangers about my problems - that said I don't like telling people I know either because I feel that they will judge me. I was also concerned about medication because I don't know if I like the idea of chemicals altering my brain (apart from alcohol that is!) But about 3 weeks ago I finally went to see my doctor. He has put me on 20mg of Fluoxetine a day, although I'm not sure whether it is doing much. I've been having headaches and going a bit dizzy as well as getting sleepy (among other side effects). It's weird though, I don't know whether I'm feeling better or not, my friends say I seem different and better for taking it but I still feel bad at times... I still lie in bed at night worrying. But I think maybe I need to take it more and see how it effects me long term. I guess even on medication we all have good days and bad days. I was scared to tell my mother that I was on anti-depressants, as she works in mental health. Some would see this as a blessing as she understands the field to a great degree, but I was worried because I thought that she might think I was mad. I eventually got the courage to tell her after about 5 days though because I was very dizzy and I thought that she would suspect me of being on illegal drugs. She is being very supportive now, while still keeping enough distance that I don't feel like she's worrying too much about me. It's good to know that she understands that it's going to help me cope though... and she says its only a minor drug compared to what some of her patients take to stop the voices telling them to do things. Anyway I decided to look for somewhere online where other people know what it feels like, and I am glad that I've found this place. I hope I can make some new friends here, and maybe I can help a couple of people too. ",diluted_e_1_a_1_uk.txt

0,"I'm 17 years old I live in the metro Detroit area and I have had depression for the past 5 years, my parents refuse to admit I have a problem, at one point I used to cut myself and at another point I was rushed to the ER to get my stomach pumped from trying to over dose. Basically I joined this forum so I can realize for myself I'm not the only one with problems. My depression has gotten a lot better over the years as certain situations got better too; I have a loving boyfriend whom I have been with for 14 months now, which I'm extremely sure that he has helped me. Next year, well in the fall I will be moving away to college, which I actually think will be a good thing for me. I am also a cheerleader at my school, which doesn't help with my depression I am constantly under pressure about that. I'm also a dancer, my parents have this thing where they like to find every little thing I do wrong. It seems as if nothing I do is good enough or right. Which has lead to my wanting to be alone and not eating. With the stress of dance and cheerleading and my parents constantly telling me I'm fat has lead me to only eat once or twice every other day. I know it is not healthy and I know it is not good, but I personally think its better then cutting and better then trying to overdose on pain killers and every other pill in the house.

1,"How to cope with disrespectful and lying friend? HI I'm new to reddit so please bear with me So this is the situation: My friend and I often interact while playing online games as we're both huge nerds and gamers. I really enjoy spending time with her. However she has this other friend that I really dislike and I would rather play alone than put up with interacting with her friend. I have on multiple occasions expressed my discomfort with her friend and she has acknowledged it but would still invite him anyways without asking me. When that happens I usually just say sorry I don't feel like playing. Sorry for being difficult. She knows her friend will repel me. So anyways after sometime I asked if I can request not to invite him when I'm playing with her and would understand if she said no cause I realize it's a selfish request. She said it's ok no problem. So then we proceed to our routine and there's no issue whatsoever. I told her if it's too difficult to say no or your friend keeps bugging you about it I can go as I didn't want to make it difficult with my own selfishness. The problem a rise when she invited a mystery friend with different name. I suspected and knew that it was her friend that I disliked so immediately asked who that was and she said it's just a random. Not happy with her lying I went off to calm down and confronted her about it, trying to be as clear and straight to the point as I can. I expressed that what she did was hurtful and disrespectful in my point of view. I told her I'm not pleased at the fact she lied even when I called her out. So I said it's on her to resolve this issue. She replied saying there is no issue and what she did was fine. Saying it wasn't disrespectful and its not a big lie plus it was to see if I would even notice its her friend. Long story short she said if it was her she wouldn't be angry cause she's a grown up and that I'm being immature and childish by blowing things out of proportion over such joke-trivial matter. So this is more or less the situation and at the moment it's not good. As she thinks I'm in the wrong and she's right. I have considered the fact that I am wrong and have asked for an outside opinion but all my friends are just angry at how she's treating me. I understand that she can be friends with and spend time with whoever she wants. It's her life afterall. I'm not making her choose cause I know it's selfish and wrong so I'm choosing to remove myself in that situation as it's the only thing to do besides putting up with her friend. My problem is the fact that she attempted to trick me to play together with her friend and continue lying about it upon confrontation. Also by doing so I feel disrespected as she completely disregarded my feelings and opinion in the matter. I would have been perfectly fine if she told me at the start her friend wants to play and she can't really say no or she wants to play with him etc etc. In that case I'll just make myself scarce which I have no issue on doing. Instead she resorted to being deceitful with something so simple and dumb. There's quite a lot more so I'll probably update this but this is in essence more of less the situation. ",Coonioby.txt

1,"Labour leaders more often than not tell us how they will ""die in the Party"". Blair said that he wasn't born in to the party but he will die in it. I now know that this is a very useful device for making people rule out the idea of ever leaving Labour and it's a phrase that sounds good, and it's one I've copied and used myself for dramatic effect. But when it came to it, when this War criminal leader decided to throw in his lot with George Bush, stayiong in the Labour was not an option. What should have been the most difficult decision I've ever had to make (after 10 years flogging my guts out for it)  leaving the Labour Party was not only an easy decision but essential. How could anyone stay in a Party that stains itself in the blood of thousands of Iraqi civilians, dropping cluster bombs on them against the will of the UK and International community, against the UN, against the Law and for George W Bush, Rumsfeld, Cheney - Financial and War criminal one and all - and with the Tories, Berlusconi, John Howard, and Aznar.  We couldn't even be bothered to count the bodies. If anyone stayed in the Labour Party after Abu Graihb I wonder what they joined the Labour for in the first place. If it wasn't for justice and for an ideal that may or may not be obtainable, at least it was aspirational for humanity. I can't even begin to list the sheer number of crimes against people, society and democracy that this Labour Party has been responsible for and every single member is to blame. Your money has paid for a montrous, election winning machine that believes in privatisation, War and inequality. All the talk of saving the Labour Party from Blair is to miss the point. When a Party becomes part of the problem it doesn't deserve to survive. The dead children in Iraq will never be brought back. A new leader will not be able to lessen the personal pain I feel knowing that by helping to elect this Labour Government I also have blood on my hands. The Tories would never have got the votes in the Commons to conduct such a filthy War. Only a Labour Party wilting at the feet of it's Leader could have pulled this off. I will never rejoin the Labour Party and stand shoulder to shoulder with people who justify slaughter in such an ignorant detatched manner. My new pledge is that I will die outside the Labour Party.

1,"Super Smash Bros. Melee is my most favorite game in the world. It is a four-player fighting game that has super simple moves compared to other fighting games. However, don't think that it is an easy game to beat and no fun to play. You still must master moves for a character just like you would for any other fighting game. You have to know when to sidestep dodge, jump, and attack your opponent. You have to know when to roll behind and when to retreat. Only true master can beat Giga Bowser and the Master and Crazy hand!  Not only do you have to beat Classic, Adventure, and All-Star mode, you also have to beat all the event matches and get all 290 trophies!

I got hoards of stuff! I love being the best at Melee! Surprisingly, they never got me down to one life! It consisted of many three life stock battles. I brought my memory card and they let me use it because they had NO characters. I have 100 percent beaten that game.  Also, I have kept a profile name. It has over 1000 wins and around fifty losses.

I lost seven pounds over one week, I called my psychologist a couple of times, cried endlessly. And it really hurt to know that maybe we weren’t as close as we once were. I am not sure if you can understand how I really felt. I’m not even sure if it’s appropriate to place it in a thread like this. I’m not sure if it was appropriate for me to end a friendship due to this situation? And is it true that if person A does not invite person B to the wedding, and if person B got hurt by it, that person A has to accept the result of person B wants to end the friendship?

1,"Best guy friend is ignoring me, and I don't understand why My best guy friend ""Jake"" (not his real name) have known each other for 14 years. We are now both 19 years old. Of all the friends I currently have, I've been friends with Jake the longest. We first met in kindergarten. I used to be really chubby and shy when I was much younger, so I got picked on a lot. Jake was my only friend back when I was in elementary school and middle school, and he stood up for me a lot back then. In high school, I started to grow out of my childhood awkwardness, lost a significant amount of weight, and managed to find a small group of friends in my school's anime club. Throughout all this, Jake was a very steady, loyal, and supportive friend, and I'm forever grateful to him for that. We ended up getting into different colleges, both around an hour away from our hometown. Even though things got somewhat busy at times, we kept in regular contact and found time to hang out when we were both in our hometown at the same time. Recently, I met a great guy ""Aaron"" (not his real name) in college. We started dating. I wanted him to meet my friends from back home, so I arranged a time to meet for dinner. During our meetup (I invited 3 friends from high school, including Jake), I noticed that Jake was unusually quiet. He didn't say much of anything during our dinner. I thought it was a bit weird because he is normally really talkative (I'm usually the quieter one in our friendship), so I pulled him aside and asked him what's wrong. He said nothing, so I figured nothing was wrong. That meetup was two months ago. About two weeks ago, I reached out to Jake on Facebook to ask him how things are going and to try to catch up on life. He completely ignores all my messages. I tried texting him to ask if he's mad at me. No response. I don't understand. I feel completely blindsided by this because Jake has never gone more than one day without responding to my messages. A mutual friend told me that she always suspected that Jake liked me, but I highly doubt that. He never showed any signs of liking me back when we were in high school, and he had a couple of girlfriends in high school. He's not the shy type, so I highly doubt he would be the type of guy to hide his feelings for so many years. ",jar_of_hearts123.txt

0,"Still recovering from ex-girlfriend To preface this, I’m sure anyone who reads this has seen something similar on this sub a million times already. This is long and the last three paragraphs are my main point, the rest is just an explanation of my previous relationship. A little over a year ago my ex and I finally split after a long year and a half of on and offs filled with tons of emotional abuse. It was mainly her abusing me at first, getting angry for not texting her quickly enough, coming at my neck for hanging out with friends everynight ( I assume was because she stayed home all the time) and so on. The last couple times we dated she was always angry with me for cheating (which I never did) later to find out she was the one cheating on me. I was extremely depressed once we finally cut ties that I went back and talked to her and then she told me she cheated in detail so she could bring me down more. After the breakup I ended up getting sick and after a couple months couldn’t even bring myself to take care of myself. Small stuff like wearing my retainer and showering before 5pm was the hardest part of my day. I know that seems small but it plays into how I feel now. 3 months after the breakup I started talking to a friend I met through my ex (however they were not and still aren’t friends anymore) and we’ve been happily together for almost a year now. There was a lot of useless drama with my ex about this which has been resolved but she still tries to harass me and my girlfriend. Last month she texted my phone from her friends number trying to harass me and it was just ridiculous. Unfortunately I have to see her in May for my girlfriend’s prom, they are in the same senior class and I an currently a college sophomore. I still feel as though I am in a rough place and don’t physically look as good as I should. Stuff such as my teeth and acne and other results of that loss of hygeine that I still struggle with makes me feel like I have been doing worse than her, which I know shouldn’t matter but it still bothers me. I’ve tried getting my old habits back which work for a month and then I lose track again. I guess my overall issue is I compare myself how I was when with her to where I am now, mostly with my appearance. I’m also still very depressed and feel that it puts me below her now. My only real win is that I’ve nearly kicked my drug addiction (mainly weed, I was using it to runaway from my problems) but now I can’t seem too kick my other habits of nicotine addiction and taking any kind of pill or cough syrup just to not be sober. I’ve distanced myself from friends and I simply feel lost and useless to the world. In college I can’t make new friends and just sit in my dorm room wishing I could go back and start over so I could be healthier than I am now. I’m looking for advice or anyone to be straightforward with me on any aspect of my situation. Thank you to anyone who reads this and responds! ",itsmitchk.txt

Everyone else with us started ganging up on me saying stuff like “This is why nobody likes you” and then my other friend comes over and tells them to keep me in the room (Theater stuff). Now everyone seems fine with me but it really upset me and I don’t know what I can do to change it. They said I ask the wrong questions and I feel like I just want to be included.

0,"Awaiting the downward spiral. Had an awesome weekend with a whole bunch of friends from online who all came together, from all around Australia, for three days of drinking and festivities. Now I've travelled home and I'm all alone again. It's great that I have so many fantastic friends Online, but it's horrible we all live so far away. I'm already missing them terribly, and feeling down. I know that I'm about to spiral downwards even futher after having gotten drunk for three days. It's inevitable, but I'm trying to prepare. I'm going to try and draw, spend time with my Service Parrot and submerge myself in my gaming community. To keep myself as positively distracted as I can. I'm already trapped in an endless loop of thinking about my ex, who I still love and miss so much, and beating myself up. Searching for answers and ways how I could of been a better person for him. He told me he hated me and that I made him feel like a child. But i never intended for my help to make him feel like that. I tried to support and encourage him with everything. Emotionally and financially. I pushed myself to work 30+hrs a week when I was anxious and depressed because he became so closed off, so we had a roof over our head and food in our belly when we were made homeless. I tried to help him with being motivated to work, and to be able to support himself. I gave him every part of myself, because I loved him so much. And I keep holding on to things he said, before he forgot what this love really meant to him. And all the love that I gave to him, that never got into him. No matter how hard I tried. I wish he knew I don't hate him for what he said to me and that my suicide attempts weren't to make him feel guilty. I genuinely wanted to end my life. The thoughts of whatever I had done for him to hate me weighs so heavy upon me, that I fear to live with a guilt that was my own. I failed to be the person he wanted me to be, but worse; I failed to be the person I needed to be for him. Now we're 2000km apart and, Emotionally, I'm  struggling to keep my head up. Financially, I know He's struggling too. Everyone keeps teling me I shouldn't care about him, but that just makes me hate myself more, that I do. I know I'm going to spiral further, it's inevitable, but I'm trying to prepare. *breathes* Edits: Grammr/Punctuation ",MisterToken.txt

1,"Uneasy family members I have had a rough and lonely childhood, in fact i do not want to remember my childhood. There used to be daily fights in the house between my mom and dad. My mom used to talk rudely then and talks rudely even now. She behaves differently outside the house and is a complete different person inside the house, behaves as though we are a burden for her. My dad is no angel either, he is arrogant and adamant, impatient and often has anger control problems, never felt close to him when a child and even now. Never felt any love towards my parent, I always had thoughts about running away from them. To add fuel to the fire my Father's mother will try to instigate any fight on any trivial matter between my mom and dad,I stayed all along with her throughout my childhood but I always thought of her as a monster. She never allowed me or my brother to ever mingle with other children freely and we didn't have many friends. I feel suffocated between my family and want to move away from them shift to another place and be independent. I have finished my graduation and still stay with my family but i feel they sap my energy and I am always negative and depressed staying with them. Criticism is a big part of our family, you are not spared if you make even a minute mistake. Appreciation word is not in my family's dictionary. On top of that my family is conservative and my mom is very very conservative in the bad sense. She will criticize other girls and women for wearing slightly short or tight clothes, but if someone wears the same clothes in our family she will applaude it. My father too judges women based on the clothes they wear and how they look, he doesn't spare men either calling them names based on their physical features. I am tired with this outlook and want to leave the house as soon as possible.There is no room for opinion in my family, especially my father who does not want to listen to anybody else and has fought with me on several occasions. He does not spare me insulting in front of other people. I don't feel easy staying along with them and at the same time feel guilty for depending financially on them.

1,"It was summer - the leather seats on my Granny's navy blue Cadillac were hot and sticky.  Going to the bank with Granny was a normal kind of errand for me and my little brother.  The First American Bank tellers were very kid-friendly; they always sent suckers for us kids when they sent back the money for Granny.  On this particular day, Granny had a telephone set in the floorboard of her car.  She was the queen of mail-order catalogs, and she had gotten this red telephone, with a red cord and handset, from one of the many catalogs that filled the end tables at her house.  The phone had big black touch tone buttons, and I was amusing myself by making lots of clicking noises as I ""dialed"" familiar numbers.  In 1987, my 8 year-old self was impressed by the thought of a phone in the car.  No one that I knew, like my parents, family or friends, owned a car phone.  As we rode down Nolensville Road, dialing those numbers made my imagination wander and soon the receiver found its way to my ear.  I became lost in a whirlwind of conversations.  Instantly, I became a wealthy young woman (since I had a ""car phone""), who was talking to famous people like country singer Reba McEntire or actor Patrick Swayze.  Patrick called me right as we pulled up to the teller at the bank.  Granny would have to get my sucker for me today - I was far too busy talking with Patrick about doing a movie next month to stop and wave at the smiling lady behind the glass.  I felt so important.  I rode around talking on my car phone for at least two weeks, until my brother pointed out that you could see the cord, and that made me look dumb.  He was just jealous that Reba didn't want him to come over and go swimming in her new heated swimming pool. ",4206523.200408120.female.25.txt

0,"I'm 46 and have been depressed since I was maybe 5 years old. I was emotionally abused by two confused parents. Depression & alcoholism runs rampantly in my family - fortunately I escaped the alcoholism. I was diagnosed as having major depression when I was about 25 and I've been on medication since then. I've also had intensive psychotherapy and done lots of research on the subject. Nothing erases the stigma!! ""Depression"" is misnamed. It should be called serotonin-deficiency disorder or something long and fancy so people will respect it. Too many say, ""Depression? Snap out of it!"" Or ""Do something to cheer yourself up."" What bunk. It affects every part of your body. Last year I realized that some of my depression was caused by kidney failure. I escaped dialysis and will probably be OK. But what a relief to have something ""serious"" to blame my problems on! Everybody respects kidney failure as a ""real disease"". I had to disown my brother last year because his reaction to my failing health was to call me a loser and an embarrassment. Very typical reaction from him, although the rest of my family were supportive. I now have no brother. I should have done it a long time ago. It takes such a long time to come to a point where you believe you deserve something good in life. I'm intelligent, employed and don't do drugs or alcohol, never have, but sometimes I feel like a bum, a worthless waste of space, not worth the effort. I have to argue myself out of that mindset every day, and it's so exhausting, and people wonder why I'm tired all the time and have no energy. I'm very angry, too. I have never had a successful relationship and don't believe I ever can. I don't even believe it exists. No kids, either, but maybe that's a good thing. They take a lot of emotional energy.

1,"Is this my distorted reality? Okay, I almost always run into this problem with friends, and I'm not sure how to get out of the situation without feeling guilty or ashamed of losing yet another friend. Situation One There's this friend whom I helped many times and every single time other people bashed me, she would either laughed with other people or further ridicule me.  Things like asking me to fix her phone, helping her find a place to rent, providing her with advice on many issues... I have since asked her not to further ridicule me, and her response was, ""oh this is not what I do, but I would like to remain friends with you because you are a resourceful person and you see things differently."" I kind of ghosted her after I graduated from university, but I always wondered whether I handled the situation appropriately.  She always tries to avoid me in public space, but when she gets into a car accident, she would call me and ask for help.  I am neither interested nor in love with her.  I actually felt she might be in a hopeless state, that's why she wanted my help. SCENARIO TWO I have this friend who always makes weird implication towards how stingy I am.  They made assumptions about my contributions to me and my SO and said things like, ""Oh, if given the opportunity, would you kill [so's name] and claim his insurance policy"", ""You know greedy people normally turn out to be the poorest bunch in the population right?"".  The fact is, I have been contributing to the relationship between my SO, my SO is older than me, so in a way, my SO is more financially independent.  At times when SO is helping me out, I always mark the number down so I know how much I owe SO [actually he calculated the amount and sends me invoices].  But I won't disclose such details to my friends.  I am just disappointed as to how people assume things and the last thing I want is to be the victim in every f*ing relationship.

She is the one of the sweetest ladies out there. Typical caring loving person, very sensitive and full of love &amp; happiness.

Honestly, he's so disrespectful to my mom at times it makes me vehement. What can I do come in and save the day (when I have done in the past it only made things worse). Anyways, I thought I knew my brother well and knew he wouldn't dare yell at my grandma. OMG boy was I wrong he crossed that line. A rage attack came at my grandma with yelling and this time I did intervene. After things settled I consoled my grandma she was shocked, sad, unable to believe he was like this. So I told her the truth he has always been like this and I feel just as much pain as she felt becuase seeing her distraught was one of the most depressing things I have ever witnessed. She wants to leave and go back although I can tell she is worried for me &amp; my mom. Hate to break the news baba but ya he's a fucking entitled narcisstic pieces of shit on the planet.

1,"i just bought a home hiv test kit from drugstore.com.  actually two.  and a bottle of wet platinum (that's stuff's yummy.  makes any session of self-love feel like you're 14 again...  but maybe that's not a good thing.  hm...)  of course, i didn't really NEED two tests nor the lube, but man i'm a sucker for bargains and i saved a whopping three cents for spending fifteen times more than i intended to.  i'm a bargain shopping stud.  the package arrived yesterday at work but i didn't want to prepare my blood sample in a shared bathroom stall.  so i thought i'd do it after a rigorous game of bowling.  and you know how much bowling gets the heart pumping and the body ready for blood sample extraction!  you basically have to prick your finger on these little plastic apparati.  of course, i was too afraid of getting pricked, so i couldn't get enough blood out of my middle finger from the shallow wound i created.  so instead, i doubled the pain by additionally having to prick my ring finger to get enough blood to fill this circle on the sample collection card.  okay, okay.  it really wasn't that bad.  i've learned to type with eight fingers quite rapidly.  no, really.  it's a lot better than getting blood taken out of your arm.  that's for sure.  the last time they did that, the nurse bruised my arm and it hurt to masturbate.  i knew i should have given the nurse my left arm...  but i'm really one big fuck up.  i just got tested a month ago.  but since then, i fucked this guy bareback and then got hit by a flu that came out of nowhere.  and this guy i screwed apparently is allergic to latex and doesn't always have safer sex with his partners.  and did i mention i already have a boyfriend?  i can deal with fucking up my own life, but when i start affecting other people's lives, i totally feel like shit and deserve more than just a couple of pin pricks on two fingers.  i can't even be straight about it.  here i am recounting my home test kit experience with witty embellishments to hide the fact that i'm a complete failure.  i can't bargain shop, i can't prick a finger, i'm a cheat, and i can't even honestly post an anonymous blog.  but at least i saved three cents.  and got free shipping.

However, he didn't say a word to me. He ignored me. He didn't even look at me. I didn't want to ignore him, i tried to get his attention, but i just didn't manage. It frustrated me. I just didn't understand why he deliberately ignored me. I was so down, I started cutting again, didn't eat for days, ... It lasted one year. The whole year he never said a word to me. Not even when my sister died. I don't understand it today and I never will. I never will forget the pain. However, i don't blame him for ignoring me. Everybody has the right to ignore me. But it hurts me so much. And today I always get the feeling people ignore me. And when people i care about do so, it's horrible. Maybe they don't deliberately ignore me, but i always think they do. For me it's the worst thing you can do to a person. It's worse than hating somebody. I wrote a poem for this guy, it's not good, but i want to share it.

1,"I want to tell her, but... Im the kind of girl who doesnt keep secrets from my mom. Recently Ive been keeping a little more. First of all, I’m in seventh grade. Just saying. The first secret I’m keeping is Snapchat. I’m not really supposed to have it but all my friends did so I made an account maybe last month and I use it regularly. I don’t see the need to tell my mom about this :/ But what I want to tell her but am afraid to is that I am dating someone. Last year I dated a boy and she wasn’t mad, she just wanted to know everything. I mean everything. She’d go through all my messages with him, she’d stalk him on Instagram (from my account!), she’d see if he texted me and sit next to me on the bed and watch me text him and tell me what I can and can’t say. I’m not an inappropriate girl. I get straight A’s, I shame on premarital sex and all that. It’s not like I’m a underage whore (trust me, we have those) and I won’t send nudes! I really like this guy and he likes me back. He told his mom we were dating literally the day he asked me out. My best friend and her crush (who likes her back) already told their moms about each other. My mom won’t let me date anymore because it’s a “distraction” and I don’t need to be “messing with hormonal boys” WHICH I’M NOT ! (Also I text this guy on SnapChat, that’s another reason I can’t tell her I have it because then she would demand my password for it and then look through all my messages on there.) I just wish it would be as easy for me as it is easy for them to tell my mom. Its making me feel super guilty because just yesterday she told me “I love you. You’re such a good daughter.” Which she’s NEVER told me before and she hugged me which she never does unless she wants something. I’m literally just trying to have some fun in middle school like everyone else. :( Please help. ",FlowerCrown123.txt

1,"Money and power are your friend, not human beings! I am cynical about friendship from my recent experience. I am from a well-off family but I’d tried to live by my own and lived in a very tiny studio. To my well-off friends, I might look humble. They partied, traveled, and dined together without me, and kept those in secret (some of those events were blurted by mutual friends). Especially one of them frequently ignored me. When I really needed someone in order to be discharged from a hospital, that person didn’t help me even though she could - she didn’t even hide it. My parents didn’t like me living in a small place rent, so they bought me a very nice condo. Those well-off friends learned this news and they were excited about it. The woman who’d been ignoring me and hadn’t helped me out, volunteered to help my moving. I refused. When I had a house warming with them, they saw my place and was anxious to be invited to any of my future parties at this new place (yes, it’s a really nice place.) And then, they started to invite me to their exclusive parties and dining gatherings. They even asked me why I put some distance from them. It was ridiculous.

1,"Sick and tired of my family and my sister's fiance So what I'm about to share is a very, very long story so I'll try to shorten it without leaving out too much info for better context of the situation. My fiance, we've been together for 3 years, is currently in basic training. There were a few rough patches before he left, partly due to the fact that he wanted to get married before leaving. I love him to death and I know he wanted to get married to get the benefits started but I didn't want to base our marriage off of benefits. I know it won't be and I know he wants to do his best to help us. When I asked why he joined, he said one of the main reasons is to provide more for us and to take care of me, which I'm grateful for but I never wanted him to feel like it was all on his shoulders. That's why we planned to move out towards the end of the year and why I'm on college, to be independent, have stability and create my identity. Now for background info, my fiance and I have been living with my sister and her fiance along with our younger brother; our brother has Autism.  Our mother lost the house due to her opioid addiction and we found a place for us to rent together. Our dad left the state the summer before my senior year of high school. So as always my sister and i pick up the pieces and make sure our brother is taken care of. We all have been living together for almost 3 years. Since we've moved into our most recent house, it has been a shit show. 100% of the drama that occurs in the house is due to her fiances family and they don't even live or pay any bills here! Surprisingly after a year of being here they've calmed down but my fiance and I are tired of it. Also I need the ability to live my life and grow as an individual. Having to hold back and set aside my needs and wants is getting tiresome. I barely even want to have children of my own because ive been a parent to my own brother. I don't feel comfortable where I'm at now, I feel like I'm only here because it is convenient, I don't feel appreciated at all. I know my sister wants to keep the family together, or what little we have left but I need room to breathe. Also when I was 16 her fiance offered oral sex to me, I know I should have told her but I also knew she wouldn't have believed me especially given that he is her first everything. I still feel uncomfortable  around him at times. My sister cares and trys her best. She wants to buy a house and move down to Texas, that's where we used to live before pcsing to Washington state. I understand the position she was put in, we both had to endure the chaos that was our family these last few years, well since I was in the 8th grade really. However, her goals and mine don't align and I don't feel like compromising those for anyone else anymore. My fiance and I just want some peace and the ability to deal with our own problems, in peace without hearing people argue in the next room. We had a plan to move out towards the end of the year but he didn't want to wait. He was even going to school, he had started his first quarter. I asked him to consider the reserves because he could go to school and when he's done move on to active duty but with him being so stubborn he went active. It's not that I never wanted him to join, my father served 22 years and I want to join as well. I'll support him for however long his career will be but now I'm trying to figure out how do I move on and start my own family. Not that it'll  include children right away, but just my fiance and I. When we get married he will be my priority and my family as well, I just don't want my sister thinking I've chosen him over them. But also I need to make decisions for myself. Just about every decision I've made has always needed me to make sure I'm available for other people. I'm tired of always being available. My sister sometimes acts as if she takes care of our brother on her own but that is far from the truth. We've both had to do the same and yet I don't think she really appreciates it, at least she won't until I move with my fiance. I'm not sure if many of you are familiar with this term but enmeshment is the term I'd use to describe my family. There is no boundaries and if you deviate from their mean then you're an oddball. I know I said I'd try to keep it short and this isn't even half of it. I want and going to move with my fiance after I've graduated and we are married. He's getting deployed after OSUT, so I'm thinking it'll be best to get married after and itll keep some stress away from having to worry about doing before he leaves. I appreciate anyone that takes the time to read this, advice is greatly appreciated. ",alexrh96.txt

I saw myself peering down and a white hand slooshing the water and slooshing my view. When it was finally clear again, all there was was a star that lit up the lake. And in the middle of the star, there was me, spread out in a crucifix shape with my eyes blazing and my hair fanning out like it does underwater.

0,"Escapism and depression Sorry about the self-pity rant that's inbound, needed to get this out there somehow. This morning I was taking a shower sitting down with the lights off - I know, pretty edgy behavior, but it's my way of unwinding and resetting myself between bouts of work. I finished up a relatively escapist story the night prior. Stupidly, I had allowed myself to suspend my disbelief and got sucked into the plot. The writing wasn't even terribly good - the only reason I enjoyed myself was because I could temporarily forget my current self and take up the role of some other more relevant and admirable character. The story ended with a shoehorned but unbearably happy ending where the main character gets married, settles in with his newfound friends, and all's good for the time being. You know, the typical ""insert generic ending here"" bullshit. Fast forward to this morning. I'm in the shower and start thinking of my day to come, making mental to-do lists, and stressing about my current temporary problems. But somewhere along the line, I start thinking of the stupid story. I can't help but start comparing my  life with that of the main character and think about how much I'd give just to be able to live a more meaningful, less real life. Then I start comparing myself to the character, and realize just how _useless_ I am. Like holy shit, I'm almost an adult and am still a passionless idiot who does nothing outside of schoolwork. Of course I can't lead a meaningful life, I'm not worthy of any of it. Thinking about this evidently stressed me out a bit too much, as I started puking what little I ate all over my shower floor and crying. I don't know. I enjoy escapism probably to a fault, but it's the only way for me to feel at least a little relevant. I'll probably come to terms with my role as human being #6,732,385,402 someday.

0,"being cyberstalked by a uk kid 😢 I have some 14 year old kid from the UK that has been cyberstalking me for the past 4 months on my twitter, Facebook, YouTube and other social media accounts all cause we had a fallout over a wwe 2k video game (yes seriously). I've been trying to block him but he keeps making more accounts telling me to kill myself and that noone cares bout me. he has told me to shoot myself in the head with a gun, drink battery acid and tells me that my friends on PlayStation are no life's for supporting and putting up with me. He also hacked into my friends YouTube channel a while back and took it down thus causing me to have to delete my main YouTube channel and lose a majority of my videos due to him threatening to do it to me too. I can't contact law enforcement as they don't seem to care and he even went so far as to make a fake girl account on twitter and try flirting with me to talk to him. He's making my life a miserable hell. And my personal life isn't going much better either 😢😢😢 ",Wraynefosterpodcast.txt
0,School is making me so stressed It’s all the time. I fell asleep last night feeling okay about stuff but woke up anxious and depressed not wanting to go to my classes. I have been failing 2 of my most important classes and I just have no reason to keep going to them. It’s finals week and I’ve been stressed about finals since school started. I don’t even know if I want to stay in school anymore because I don’t want to feel like this. I’ve also been slacking off so much on homework. It doesn’t matter to me anymore it just feels so useless to do. ,daftpunk34.txt
1,"I was at a wedding in NH this past weekend, and I can't help but wonder how many more weddings I will attend before I myself get married. I'm not dating anyone currently, but this getting married thing seems to be catching on like wild fire. Not that I am opposed to it. In fact, when I was in my last major relationship, I was pushing for it myself. But why? Did I think he was the one? Well, it did cross my mind, but I just saw him for the first time since we broke up on Sunday (after the Sat. wedding) and it is amazing to see how far we both are from that now. Does it make sense to get married when you don't know what you yourself want out of life? I'm starting to realize that the answer to that last question is 'no.' So, I don't think I am going to go looking for a husband any time soon, since I need to figure out my own path first.... but I must say, it is difficult to sit there by yourself and witness all the couples planning their weddings knowing how far off you might be. That must be a girl thing though! ",4049756.200408020.female.25.txt
0,"This is a great topic. It looks like people associate with what was shared. I was laughing a little because for awhile I was so hypersensitive to sound I would not even consider turning anything on that created noise, even the noise from lights was too much. I used to go to a counselor who had a radio on in her waiting room. I could not stand it and used to turn it off. Then someone would turn it back on, having no understanding of what it was like to be me at that moment. That's funny to me now. I still don't like noise but I'm lucky since I have pretty good control over my environment. For awhile I was working in cubicles and was not sure I was going to make it. The one comment I wanted to share was what I experienced when I did turn the TV back on, read the newspaper, listened to the radio. I went without it for two years. What I experienced was the way the news was presented. I was captivated not by the words or circumstances of stories, but the tone of voice, the selection of what sound bites to use, the background chosen for a shot. I'm still fascinated by all that and even dreamed the other night I had been hired to be that person who decides how to present something. In my dream I was having a moral dilemma. My integrity is important to me and, in my dream, I was talking to my boss and trying to explain the emotional angst I was in. She kept saying, give them what they want, who are you to decide what is best for them. I woke up before I decided to quit or stay. But those words stayed with me through a day, who am I to decide what's best for someone else? What I do now is selectively listen to the news. I like NPR and sometimes enjoy McNeil Lehrer. I find if someone is expressing a strong opinion I will get annoyed if the presentation does not also include an opposing viewpoint. My main issue is selective presentation. I feel disrespected if someone is asking me to just trust them. I want to know what are the observations leading to a conclusion. I want to know what level of uncertainty there is. I don't like anyone telling me how to think or feel. I'm perfectly capable of creating all the drama I could ever use, on my own. I'm not clear where to place blame for all the drama the industry of information puts out there. I know someone is to blame. If only I could find that person or group then my hatred would be perfect. I'm kidding about that last sentence. I'm just trying to get a rise out of someone reading my share--I'm being frisky. I support public broadcasting and free speech. If I was in charge meetings would last forever because everyone would get a chance to speak. Wouldn't it be great if there truly was free speech in America. Wouldn't it be great if the principle of dissent was truly an American ideal. Isn't it supposed to be? ",dawgdean_e_1_b_1_us.txt

1,"My name is Crystal  My life story is not all that good. You may not like what I say. My father left me when I was 7. After that my mom found a boyfriend named Jim. My mom and dad are still married to this day. Still to this day there is fighting . When I was 13 my dad called and started telling me what to do with my life. But I told him off and said ""you was not in my life so don't try to tell me what to do"". When I was 14 I lost my virgenity to an asshole I thought I had it all untill some slut came around. When I was 15 I fell in love with an asshole again  He gave me a ring on my birth day. I did not know I was being treated by my boyfriend at the time. I was being treated like a dog. In my life I feel like I lose everything I have ever loved. Most of my family think I'm not ready for the world but I know I am. I'm sorry to my family for doing bad things  I'm sorry to my best friends for being for telling the truth. Some people don't like the truth most people don't Like me because I tell the truth.  Most people think I'm just like all the outher girls but as you can see I'm not. I'm just lost and crazy in this world. I feel like I don't belong in this world and know where to go. So I'm thanking my boyfriend for helping me trust again and I love him. I have two sisters ones name is Carolann I love her so much but she don't think that I am smart. She thinks I am going to fuck up my life just like she did. My sister Jill lives far away from me and she is lost and confused I have nothing nice to say about her. I have one brother named Garold but hes gay. Most peolp think that I am a slut but I know the truth thats all I need and if I was a slut you would know it. Just because I got the body to be a slut dones not make me one. And just because I had two boyfriends live with me does not mean I am a slut I was just looking for the guy that I am with now.  And just because I hate geting up for school does not mean I am going quit. And just because I don't talk to you for a week does not mean I am out going to fuck up my life.   ~Thank you for reading this~   Crystal Leeman ",3885617.200407090.female.16.txt

0,"I sob thinking about my painfully wasted young years I'm going to write this hopefully without stopping to think myself into madness with corrections and such. Too late I just backspaced two whole sentences! There is this big fucking hard block of concrete in my head that stops me from doing anything including things I like such as drawing and reading. I love going on tumblr and pinterest and deviantart to look at the amazing drawings and paintings people are able to create. Sometimes though, I get really jealous of the fictional characters in the fandoms. Heck, I get really jealous of people in my life and around the world; young people. I just get this sinking, dreadful feeling inside my chest realizing that I'm wasting my young years doing nothing. I'm 24 now, and looking back on my life I've just been a sad, pathetic underachiever with no drive or history of doing anything adventurous. I'm wasting my young years. I'm wasting my young years. It plays over in my head all the time. I can't get my brain to shut off. Every night before I go to bed it plays over and over. I'm just so sad and disappointed in my life and how I've done nothing with it. Even as a little kid I never did anything fun and I don't have any wild stories of adventure, excitement, nor things like ""Lol we were dumb kids yada yada...We did this all the time yada yada..."" I'm sorry for the rant. Writing it out didn't help me get the chants out of my head. I'm so sad guys. And I know that fictional characters are deliberately made to be fascinating and have amazing lives, but there are people who were born 5 years before me (who are real, yes) and they are really living their lives to the fullest and are doing amazing things. Right now I want to go out, rent a solid 4x4, and drive to some god knows where designated dark space and lay on my back and gaze at the stars in the night sky. I want to go do something fun and amazing, but knowing I've wasted so many years being depressed in bed, on my computer, sleeping, and just doing nothing will haunt me forever.

I woke up late, and isn't it funny, it seems that most days when u start them off bad by sleeping in when you shouldn't, they just go downhill from there.  It's true, observe your day next time you wake up late...  but it wasn't the small annoyances that made my day 'one of those days'... these small things such as being late for work, the kids being off, tripping over EVERYTHING, breaking my cell phone (on one of the trips ), and losing my keys just made the bigger things in my life... much BIGGER today... As I look on my life right now, it seems like utter chaos, and I don't like it.  I am trying to be strong, but lately I just don't know.  How do you gracefully walk away from someone you love no matter how right you KNOW it is, especially when you are sending them straight into the arms of someone else??

0,"There truly is no hope. For any of us. This is the bleakest truth of all. Everything is more complicated than you think. You only see a tenth of what is true. There are a million little strings attached to every choice you make; you can destroy your life every time you choose. But maybe you won't know for twenty years. And you may never ever trace it to its source. And you only get one chance to play it out. Just try and figure out your own divorce. And they say there is no fate, but there is: it's what you create. And even though the world goes on for eons and eons, you are only here for a fraction of a fraction of a second. Most of your time is spent being dead or not yet born. But while alive, you wait in vain, wasting years, for a phone call or a letter or a look from someone or something to make it all right. And it never comes or it seems to but it doesn't really. And so you spend your time in vague regret or vaguer hope that something good will come along. Something to make you feel connected, something to make you feel whole, something to make you feel loved. And the truth is I feel so angry, and the truth is I feel so fucking sad, and the truth is I've felt so fucking hurt for so fucking long and for just as long I've been pretending I'm OK, just to get along, just for, I don't know why, maybe because no one wants to hear about my misery, because they have their own.

So I have a group of about 13 friends, some of us have been friends most of our lives and others have joined over the past 10 years. One friend I’ve always be closest to went though a tough time recently and it was decided by some of the louder group members that she shouldn’t be part of the group anymore as she wasn’t making any effort and she was being a drama queen! (She definitely was not and they were all being extremely judgemental without knowing her full story) I totally disagreed with them and confronted them about it. The loud ones argued back and the others stayed quiet and a few then spoke to me privately later and said they agreed with me. There are a few that I will never again consider a friend going forward! My dilemma is that there are still a good few in the group I enjoy spending time with and would like to remain friends with and I am also friends with the excluded friend! I feel that I either have to leave the friendship group or remain in it and stay quiet about how awfully they treated my friend and put up with the nasty few! Either way I feel awful. I don’t really know the purpose of this post but I don’t really have any other friends so if I break away from this group I wouldn’t have any left apart from the other excluded friend.

1,"I have a close friend who is problematic, but not towards me A couple of years ago, I had a falling out with one of my friends and during this time, I fell back on this girl in my class, who I will call Blue. We got close in only a few months, and eventually, this will be the only time we will ever be in the same class. It was just the two of us. I'm in one of her classes now and my friends still associate me as her best or one of her closest friends. It's not a particularly good association (doesn't reflect on me though, just her). A lot of people don't like her, especially the people I'm friends with now. I haven't been around for a while (I moved down to Brighton for a bit of time) and I haven't seen her either, but I know that she doesn't have a lot of friends. I've been hearing stories and past anecdotes about her that really troubled me, so I'd like to have some advice. This one girl (who would never lie about something like this because she's so sweet, probably still hasn't gone through puberty) said that Blue once pit her up against the teachers and made her cry because she was so stressed and she didn't understand the situation. Blue has a kind of controlling personality and will not be open-minded to other people's ideas and input. An idea of close friend of my close friend, Yellow, was swept by as Blue simply dismissed it, and just wrote what she wanted to do in a group project. Yellow is also quiet, VERY passive and formerly a good friend of Blue and to some point, even I, so when I heard this happening to Yellow, I was really shocked that Blue could even do something like that. She will also guilt-trip you and self-deprecate herself. She will tell you that everyone hates her and that she's really bad at a subject she does really well in. It's annoying, and sometimes I even hear it, but to others she does it in this really soft, guilt-tripping voice. It's a problem because often, she's the problem and then she guilt-trips to turn it to look like she's saying that the people calling her out are just trying to make her feel bad. But Blue has never done any of this to me. When I'm around her, we talk about our futures and Star Wars. She jokes and memes a lot, but because we're not as close anymore, they aren't as funny. I avoid confrontation too so I almost never rebutt her points. Recently, she apologized to me about how poor her behaviour was back then, but I didn't understand what she was talking about. Now, I get it. But her behaviour wasn't just 'back then' either, it was also just a couple (maybe about two) years ago. Maybe even now, but everyone has probably already distanced themselves from her. She also has this fake 'caring' voice that she uses around the people in her music group. She never uses this voice around me, but the music people all generally speak like that. The thing is, the 'caring' side to her is just like a mask, and the people who know her know that she's not usually like that. She has hurt their friends who don't deserve to be hurt, and for no apparent reason either. I know that most of my friends feel uncomfortable bringing her up around me because it'll be something negative (I've never heard anyone who really knows her say something positive about her), but because of that I've been sheltered to how she treats her classmates. Another girl (Red) once said that while she was consoling a friend who didn't like to be touched, Blue came in, wrapped her arms around the sobbing girl and 'glared' at Red like one of those mean girls. Never have I ever heard something so cliched and dramatised, but unfortunately, I could definitely picture it. When I'm around her, I definitely don't feel like her personality is weighing down on me, but I'm conscious of the connotations surrounding her. All the girls mentioned are also my friendly mutuals, so they don't associate me with her, as I'm generally polite, quiet and will crack a joke around them. I also know that Blue doesn't like people so when we were walking from our class, I'm worried that we'll bump into someone that doesn't like her or whom she doesn't like. So yes, I am very bothered about how people view her, mostly because there actually is something to dislike. What should I do? Slowly back out of this friendship? Should I slowly doorslam her until the end of the year when our class is over? Should I just continue being her friend despite her bad behaviours? Two things: the stories are most definitely true, and I don't want Blue to know that I know about her being a bad classmate. I overheard these stories from reliable people. Sorry for the long post. Please help. ",nightection.txt

I’m just going to get straight to the point, I have these two friends ( I’ll call them Ava and Chloe) who fall out with me and the rest of my friends as they believe there’s more that two genders and the rest of us don’t believe that (I’m not saying they can’t believe that but I’m just saying the way that they act when we say we don’t is bad). They usually talk to us the day after and act like nothing happened, but it bothers me. So here’s a summary of what happens. Someone brings up the topic of genders, and then will say how they think there’s two, then either Ava or chole will get mad and will storm of or start shouting at us. Ava once called my boyfriend a “close minded cunt” simply because he said he didn’t agree with her. If they believe that there’s more than two genders, I am totally ok with that, it’s just that they try and make the rest of us believe it too and then put the blame onto us and it’s starting to bug me.

1,"Hi there.  I don't plan on telling anyone I know about this blog spot. Fuck it. I have been on an eating binge since Friday.   On Friday I ate mushrooms and had an awesome time hanging out with some people I am just getting to know. It does seem however that I am not going to be hooking up with one of the girls like I had hoped.  Which makes about 31 times in a row for me to fall into that gray area called the friend with no benefits zone.   I am going to be a dick from now on.  Not that I feel like a dick but I don't want to be disappointed  by some shitty friendship where I get to hear some girl cry about her exotic exboy friend.  Fuck him.  That pillow biter. Fuck her.  I cover the tabs and she knows why.  Once a month she might pretend she wants me over after he neglects to call her because he is getting it some where else. And God forbid I summon the courage to bust a move.  Even on an eight of strong mushrooms I can't put aside my cowardice and at least offend someone with my rotten cigarette breath kisses.  I had gum.  My trip lasted way longer than everyone else and she clearly did not want me to even sleep on her couch but I couldn't just up and drive home, i was seeing 8 of everything and they were all melting.  I did feel bad wandering around the tiny apartment zapped out of my mind while she slept.  I did bug out at the beginning of the night.  There were about 45 minutes to an hour where I could not bring myself to say one word.  I think everyone else was starting to think that either I was retarded, angry with them, or even more retarded.  Lucky I did break out with some good material and get some good laughs.  So did my friend's cousin,  she also had some funny moments.  I keep sending weird text messages this girl.  I even called her and left a message with the excuse that I couldn't find my wallet just so she would call me back and tell me it wasn't at her apartment.  but to most people this probably isn't a new trick.  what is wrong with me.  why don't girls like me?

My parents are separated, but I see them both equally, so it isn't that bad a deal, and I have two brothers- one twin brother and one half brother, who's currently six. He (the latter) is really cute, but he's also terribly annoying and (in m opinion) a little spoilt.   I like to RP (RolePlay), mainly the online kind, so you can often find me in the RP sections of forums, or MUSHing on sites like  Elendor , but most of my time is lately spent in study or at Ju Jitsu training, which is really very fun, despite all the bruises.   Well, that's about all I can think of at the moment, so I'll be off and I'll post sometime later! I plan to try a very different style of journal writing, so I'll see what I can come up with!

1,"After much encouragement from my tech-savvy boyfriend, I’ve decided to get on board with the concept of blogging. As a writer, it only makes sense that I find an outlet to document my thoughts. However, I still kinda feel like Doogie Houser at the end of an episode when he would type a couple of sentences on his old school computer to both sum up his day and offer some sort of introspective look at the universe. Remember how he would always pause right before the last few words? That lame theme music would play as he contemplated the perfect vocabulary to capture the essence of his experience. And then he would always type the last couple of words r-e-a-l-l-y s-l-o-w-l-y. I guess that was a primitive form of blogging.   I still find the concept of putting your thoughts out for the world to read intimidating and intriguing. I mean, why would anyone care what I had for breakfast or thought of a movie I had recently seen? I guess it’s just like having a diary, but how personal can a blog get if you know everyone can read it? Regardless, I feel that writing for leisure again instead of just for work will be a positive experience for me. ",4039579.200407260.female.25.txt

He makes me feel like a worthless piece of shit sometimes. I want to stop being friends with this guy, but he’s friends with all of my other friends.

I also want to sleep more than anything in the world, it’s my favourite thing. However, I can’t sleep, no matter how hard I try I normally lie awake for hours and when I do sleep I just wake up like 5-7 times a night.

I've been searching for a job for 4 months to no avail (I used to have an office job for 4 years before quitting it to take a leap of faith to migrate to another country), and from the second month onward, I've plunged deeper and deeper into depression. Back then in uni days, I was diagnosed with clinical depression and was put on medications. I've been off them since my graduation, because I didn't want to depend on them for the rest of my life and I didn't really have the funds to continue the treatment back then. These days I feel exactly like I am slogging through those low energy periods again. My mind would never shut down at my usual bedtime and at times anxiety would keep me awake until 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning. My biological clock is a total mess, in the morning I would just sleep in and refuse to wake up, even though it's already past noon. I tend to shy away from as much social interaction as possible; I just plainly don't want to meet anyone, it freaks me out and makes me uncomfortable. I even refuse to answer any emails or continue the dreary job searching and job application. I know that I am in a big mess. I disgust myself for my lack of energy and determination to do anything. But then when I'm faced with the colossal task at hand, I'd chicken out, then I'd sleep on it, hoping that everything would somehow sort themselves out, only to find myself wake up in the next morning groggy and lethargic.

0,"Well I'm new here so here goes nothing. I have been diagnosed clinically depressed, along with obsessive compulsive disorder.  I'm 32 years old.   I've been divorced once and have since re - married.  I have 2 children, 7 year old boy (stepson) and 4 1/2 year old girl.  I work for a state government agency repairing computers. So far so good right?  Well the major problems I'm having is becoming a social recluse.  I have a REALLY hard time ""letting things go"".  In 2005, I lost both my sister (suicide) and my father (heart attack), and those events only added to the trauma I'd been going through.  I live in a small town, so when I went to the doctor about possible ADHD (i was moody, couldn't focus on work, couldn't complete tasks on time etc), they determined I was bipolar and put me on Effexor and Wellbutrin.  Well that just did absolutely nothing.  In fact my anger with the world increased dramatically and I had rage episodes that about destroyed my second marriage.  I've had a lot of rage in the past.  Recently I haven't had any outbursts.  I'm currently taking Cymbalta and Celexa and that seems to be a good combination.   But I still have a hard time going to work, and functioning throughout the day.  I'd rather stay at home, in my bedroom, away from people most of the time.  That's what bothers me.

0,"Depression and grief I am a 28 yr old M, who has been diagnosed with treatment resistant MDD from the age of 16. Recently, I was attempting to get into a ketamine study in a NYC hospital and was asked a number of questions about my background. One item which came up that I have not thought about in a while was the specifics of my uncles suicide when I was around 13. My uncle was a 28 yr old gay M, developed HIV and killed himself. Though this is not what I was initially told. It took around 10 years with every year or so getting a new piece of information. Initially I was told he had cancer and died. Then I was told he had cancer and my grandparents ""pulled the plug"". Then I was told he was gay, had cancer, and my grandparents ""pulled the plug"". Then I was told he was gay, had HIV, and my grandparents ""pulled the plug"". Then, finally, I was told he was gay, had HIV and killed himself. I think I secretly had an understanding of how he had killed himself even when I was a kid and was not told due to subtle hints that kids will typically pick up on. Even if I did not, I always had the feeling that something was wrong and that my parents were not truthful. After discussing his death for two hours for the study, I realized that the depression I have been feeling for over 12 years is so similar to the feeling I get when I think of my uncle. Intense grief. I delved into the feeling more and have not been able to stop crying for the past few days about my uncle. Does this make sense from a psychological stand point to be greiving for this long? I know there is no time limit on emotions but does it make sense for my depression to be as a result of shoving down his death and holding onto it for all this time?

I dont know exactly what I am looking for by posting this but I have really been struggling with the emotions I have been having and would appreciate some guidance and if not, some affirmation.

0,"Well, a little update then. For those who don't know me that well yet, (which is everybody I suppose) I'm the 20 (almost 21) year old that chose to take a break from school, due to pff what'll it be? Anxiety, depression, health problems regarding sleep/energy. I tried it again at some point, but after 2 weeks found myself to be, not cured yet. I figured it had to end, so I went looking for help. Social worker, well that's all nice and stuff, but not too helpful. Then the official psychiatrists. Well let's pick up from there; the first one, in the Adolescents department directed me to another shrink after the first intake meeting, my help question; not sure. But something was keeping me from being able to fit in the system. I also had concentration problems but she didn't want to dig into that. So this new shrink, on a different department, made me fill in some forms and we had some talks (2) and well, apparently the concentration problem IS a big issue and causing a lot of damage as well as my past (divorced parents, being bullied all my life etc etc.) Okay fine, so I says; maybe I need something to help me sleep? And she suggested I go see my house doctor and ask for sleeping medicines. Which I got, and used for two weeks now and ...nothing. Well, the first 2 days were good, the 2 after that were less good, and I don't even remember the ones after that. I woke up automatically, and sometimes sleep was okay. But after 2 weeks I'm still SO tired everyday, it's killing me. I try and keep up a new rhythm, but it's so exhausting and I feel like doing all sorts of happy things but I just don't have the energy and then I go do it anyway and I end up so hurt and tired. Now, I can't take the medicines for more than two weeks, so today was going to be my last. Well, I sort of should have read the booklet I got with it before use. It said I shouldn't take them EVERY day but every other day, and like I don't know, it says it builds up and stays in your body. Well, I'm fine don't worry. They warned about some side effects, but I seem to have been okay. However, the side effects include ALL the things I already suffered from BEFORE even taking the darn medicines!!! So it's been a complete and utter waste. This one day, I tried sleeping without medicines, and I just couldn't...just, can't fall asleep. So yeah, I had that talk with yet another shrink today, and now he wants me to see some other person. And he thinks I SHOULDN'T take sleeping medicines. So like, ARGH, people keep telling me opposite things, and now they want me to see this person, who'll help me fill in my days and get organized??? That's all cool and well and all, but I got there myself already. I figured it all out before I even started seeing these ""professionals"" and now they're telling me what I already came up with on my own??? It's another 3 week wait. And I don't know anymore. I'm confused about all this, and beginning to think it's been a huge mistake in the first place. And now that it's Spring again, I'm feeling sort of happy. So depression is still here, but, I don't notice it much...or do I? I'm still feeling so alone and my family still doesn't get me...I just want out, I just want to be away from here, which brings us back to the original problem. I'm so annoyed, and after this, today is just going to be another day that I just don't do anything useful... Sure I want to go back to school, but it takes time...I have some time, then again I don't... I had so many plans, and ARGH this sleeping problem, which is going to be my main focus now, is just so darn annoying. I could listen to countless pieces of advice, but in the end, it's just no good to me... Even the stupid sleeping medicines don't work...And every time I go see a shrink about one problem, they point me to someone else, and then another problem bothers me and they send me back but that still didn't fix my first problem. I'm like, fine I'll go fix this darn problem myself then. (I really feel like cursing, but I won't because it's not proper so I'll release some rage when I'm done here, but just know that I'm really upset and annoyed). After all, it was me who had to fix everything all my life right? So I might as well start now... haha such a laugh, I'll procrastinate till the day I die... So very tired.

1,"I don’t want to lose friendship of 10 years but I think it’s going that way Hi guys, I don’t usually do this but I literally feel like I have nowhere else to vent. Ok. I have been friends with this person for 10 years since we were teenagers. We both clicked over time through going to the same school and I really liked her personality. We ended up going to college in the same city so during that time we sometimes hung out and I let her stay over at my place a few times when she needed to. After graduation she’s spent some time living in other countries teaching and we have kept in contact but not as much, though we have met up when she’s been back. So the last time I saw her in person was when she was on a break from teaching 3 months ago. Since then we have occasionally talked but it’s been me sending messages more than her. The last time we Skyped was 2 months ago and last time we had a proper conversation was a month and a half ago when I asked her for some advice about a trip I was going on. I then stopped messaging her for a few weeks as I didn’t want to bother her if she was busy. Started messaging again but just sending a few pictures of my trip and seeing if she wanted to talk. She saw my messages but didn’t reply. So I left it another week - I sent her a few messages today but again she was online and reading them and no reply. I have tried not to bother her if she’s busy and have stressed to her that I don’t want to bother her but she has just gone silent on me since late January and it’s basically been me trying to initiate conversation with her and her not responding. The thing is I am racking my brain and trying to think what I could have done to upset her - if anything, and I can’t think of anything. I have questioned whether I’m getting ahead of myself but then not having her around makes me miss her and feel hurt that she’s suddenly decided to stop talking to me for whatever reason. The thing is I have been considering what loss it would be for me to not be friends with her anymore - It wouldn’t be easy for me as she is one of the only few people I still speak to from my school days and we could relate so much to each other. But if for some mysterious reason she’s cut me off and no longer wants to be friends then what can I do? I basically sent her a message saying I wouldn’t try contacting her again voluntarily and left it at that. I feel like I may never hear from her again and it really hurts. But what can I do? If something isn’t there anymore then it’s just not there. - A 20 something year old female who is tired of petty childish bullshit ",bibs93.txt
1,"Friend is acting distant, not hanging out much, i don't know what to do. *Apologies ahead of time for the novel.* So i (M 30s) have been friends with my buddy (M 30s) for several years, and there seems to be a repeating pattern with him and i really don't know what to do when this happens.  Instead of a long history, i'll just cite these last few months as an example. So as i said, we've known each other for quite a while.  He's probably my best friend, although i wouldn't say i'm his (i'm not sure he really has one).  But anyways, prior to the last couple months we were hanging out as we usually do.  If we don't hang out every other day, we'd usually catch up over voice chat while playing video games, etc...  And this is the normal routine for us, we'd talk or hang out at least every other day, if not more often.  Then suddenly, a few weeks ago, it's like a switch went off and he's out. What i mean by that is since then, i may hear from him once a week for an hour or so, at best; sometimes longer.  When we do chat, he mostly seems normal, but i can tell he's off.  So i've asked him what he's been up to, what's going on in his life, you know the usuals, and i get the usual answers for him: work, playing video games, seeing his parents occasionally.  I've brought up his absence and asked him what's going on, and his answer is usually the standard runaround, ""oh nothing"", ""i've just been avoiding everyone"", ""just doing my own thing"".  I pressed a little harder a couple weeks back and got a jokingly put ""i guess i've got a serotonin imbalance, haha"". I could sense his desire not to talk about it (which he never does, he hates discussing anything feelings related), so i let it go. Next time we spoke, i brought it up again, asked him how he was doing with his issues, and got the usual ""meh"" or ""i dunno"".  When i asked what i could do to help him, he answered, ""you can stop fucking asking me about it"", so i of course let it go, and our convo continued as if there were no problems.  But of course there are, he's still MIA for weeks at a time.  The thing is, this is a pattern with him.  We're normal buddies, seeing/chatting all the time for months, and then WHAM, he's out and like this for weeks or a few months.  Then as if another switch goes off, he's back on again and acts normal and as if nothing's happened.  This has happened more times than i can count. You know i wouldn't be so concerned if he were actually busy with life and doing things, but as he tells it in his own words when i do see him, he's doing nothing out of the ordinary (which for him is work and sitting home every night by himself (lives alone) playing video games (something we usually do together).  But as far as i can tell he's just sitting alone by himself every night. I've considered the possibility he's depressed or bi-polar (although you'd never get him to admit that), in which case i don't know what to do if he won't talk to me about it.  I've considered that perhaps i've done something to make him angry, but when he does come around (if i'm not bringing up this issue), he acts completely normal and we laugh and cut up, and whatnot like nothings wrong.  I've thought perhaps he's just not interested in being friends anymore, but he does still come around, and as i've said, after one of these episodes for a few weeks/months it's as if nothing's happened at all. So my problem is this.  I don't know what to do when he's like this.  I don't know how to act, what to say, how to approach him, etc.  You know, he's my best friend, i'd like to be there for him, to help if i can, but he rebuffs any attempt on my part to find out what's really going on, well besides him just ""avoiding everyone right now, and doing my own thing"".  He gets agitated if i push the issue.  So how do i handle this?  Is there a way to broach this topic that would get a better response?  When he does come around, how should i act around him?  What do i say, should i even bring it up?  I'm a very open person regarding my feelings and inner workings, and he's obviously not.  If this is just a thing he does, if it's not my fault and there's genuinely nothing i can do to help, how would i even get him to tell me that's the case if he doesn't like talking about it?  When he gets this way i just feel like i'm walking on eggshells around my best friend.  I dunno if it's ok to text, to invite him around, or whatever cause i'm afraid it's gonna bother him and push him further away. So i'm sure i've left out a lot of details, but i guess that's the gist of it.  I would appreciate any meaningful advice anyone has to offer, especially if anyone around here has experienced anything similar with a friend.  Thanks to everyone ahead of time for replying.

1,"Friend is badgering me to give them stuff, and frankly it's making me feel less inclined to reciprocate. So. I'm going to use fake names for these people instead of referring to them as mere pronouns. Me = The CrazyCOKids Orlando = The guy who is badgering me because, well, Orlando *is* the name of a character in Redwall who is a badger. Grath = Second person Fallow = Someone else, mutual friend of all of ours. So. Grath and I decide to do something together just the two of us. However, Orlando is a bit... *jealous*. Like, all the time someone else I'll refer to as Fallow wants to do something with me or Grath. Orlando seems to have this... massive victim complex. This isn't entirely unjustified mind you^ , but the problem is, he tends to extend this to friends. If say, Grath or Fallow decide to do something together, Orlando assumes he is being excluded on purpose and maliciously. See, we basically want to be friends with each other, rather than being ""by association"". (ever hang out with a group of people, yet you realise the only reason you know some of them is because another person brings 'em along? yeah.) We basically don't wanna just be ""Orlando's friend"" or ""Grath's buddy"", or ""Crazy's friend"" to each other. So we're intentionally doing some things with each other. Orlando, however, wants to be included in *everything*, and thinks that if people are doing something without him, he's being excluded intentionally and maliciously. So at first we didn't mention what we were doing, because Orlando would come in private and ask ""You going to do me next?"" or start going all ""Oh nobody ever thinks to include me I'm always the one left out"" or starts trying to guilt-trip us. But then, well, that obviously made him think that we were hiding stuff from him. Whenever we went to him first (and boy do we ever) he doesn't complain, and frankly it seems like we really shouldn't have to run everything through him because we're not in grade school still and you know, oftentimes if we *do* run it past him and ask if he would like to get involved he complains that he feels like 'the third wheel' or 'like we're just including him to be nice'. :/ Then he decides to start harassing us asking if we'll include him in things, essentially demanding we do things to him to make it up, then doing things like ""I just want to be included so then I can at least enjoy this thing"". So he guilt-trips us with how bad his (admittedly shitty) homelife is to try and get us to do things one-on-one with him or give him gifts. Enough is enough. Simply put we wanna put our feet down - again. Except! I know what'll happen. Orlando will take it as an act of aggression and with malicious intent. Grath will start complaining at Orlando for (admittedly) being immature about the whole thing. He'll start acting like we're ganging up on him, even though we're trying to tell him that when he asks for stuff in private the way he is, that we're only doing it just to shut him up. i've tried telling him to try organising things himself for a change so he's not always going ""Hey! Wait for me!"" but he doesn't seem to get it. ",CrazyCoKids.txt

1,"Advice To preface this, I wanna say that I feel pathetic/incompetent/exhausted. Female, 30, currently staying at a hotel because I had to leave the house I was living in because of a conflict that recently happened. I got into a verbal argument with my sister (34) that resulted into a physical altercation. She screamed ""Go kill yourself"" and then shoved me and scratched me. My father was a witness to this. I then called the cops because i felt unsafe, she got so angry and turned a bit violent. (This is the third time she's told me to go kill myself and my parents haven't told her anything). Right before the cops came she was arguing with my dad and told me to ""Shut the f*** up! The cops arrived I told one of the cops my side of the story and she told hers. She said that I attacked her and that there were scratch marks on both her arms. I told the cops how could that be when none of the nails on my right hand are very short (I swear to you I couldn't have scratched seeing since I had no nails on one hand. The nails on my right hand are VERY short because they all broke due to cleaning the kitchen cabinets etc). The cops didn't believe me. My sister also claimed that I'm ""bipolar"" which I'm not. So the cops believed my sister and took me away on a 5150. I was released 3 hours later because the case manager said I didn't have any mental health issues. The funny thing is that I told my parents that I wanted permission to use their car to leave that house because I couldn't handle the stress that came with living with her. I would eventually return the car once I moved, got myself established etc. The stress has caused me to lose 3 pounds this week alone. After returning from the behavior health services, I gathered  my bag and one suitcase and left. Currently, I'm staying at a hotel.

0,"Desperate for advice or input; I lost and am losing everything held dear to me right now due to multiple reasons, and would just like to hear some different recommendations I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO I DONT KNOW WHERE I WENT WRONG OR HOW TO FEEL BETTER!! I've typed this out way too many times so I'm gonna do my best to sum it up as short as I can: Last week me and my gf of 10 and a half months broke up, i was devestated. In that little time I have experienced more love, more of life than ever before and it felt like we'd been together forever. I thought, maybe we would work things out on our own and get back together when the time was right, even though i knew it was a stretch, but i was also okay with just being friends if that was what the world had planned. 2 days after the break up im talking to both of my best friends who are also (kinda?) friends with her, and they both tell me that she basically told them she had absolutely no intention of ever getting back with me because she wanted to ho around without the commitment of a relationship. She also openly bragged to one of them that she had cheated on me multiple times during our relationship. This all made me very angry and on top of that hurt. The same night just after finding all of this out I find out from my other friend that she had called her and bragged about hooking up with this one kid who, during our entire relationship, she told me she hated and that we BOTH already had bad history with, and fooled around. Then later (AGAIN) she goes on instagram live with my bestfriend who is kinda being fake just to see how she really is and openly brags about blocking me (which added to the hurt cause i had done nothing but try to respect her wishes since the split in hopes that we could at least part on good terms ya know) , saying that i was 'fucking crazy' and that she never wanted anything to do with me ever again. There's more in terms of details but thats the basic general idea of the past week for me. I dont know how i feel or what to say. I feel hurt and i feel abandoned and i feel stupid and i feel not good enough and i feel like a complete fuck up i feel so fucking awful its not even funny. Im losing my friends because my stupid brain cant get over this and im constantly going to them to talk about it because that's the way i like to deal with stuff, but they've heard the same thing one too many times and i get that i just dont know what else to do. Im tired of thinking about it, im tired of not being able to confront her but my friends say its not a good idea because its not gonna do anything but make her think even higher of herself for having fucked me up so badly and wont at all make her change her ways. I want to completely forget but at the same time a part of me wants to work everything out just so i can mean something to this person who meant absolutely everything to me at one point again, WHY?? Why does my brain, or heart, or whatever still crave attention from her, or maybe even her herself, even after knowing all of this? Why am i so fucking pathetic?

1,"Hey all.  Just felt that i needed a change, so i have deleted all previous posts. they were boring, anyway.  My grandmother is in the hospital again. she's been puking and having dizzy spells, and the doctors don't know exactly what's wrong with her. so much for modern technology.  Read the  Da Vinci Code  by Dan Brown. interesting book. it argues that Jesus was not divine, and that the church invented his divinity. Also argues that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene. well i'm not going to go in depth to argue anything, but i think Dan Brown made lots of mistakes in his assumptions. for example, he writes that Peter was the one in the picture "" The Last Supper "" who was making threatening gestures. apparently that man is Judas Iscariot, not Simon Peter. that explains a lot about the hand gestures.  Anyways, there's a reason why the book is under the fiction section in book shops and libraries.  Thinking of getting a new cpu.  Thinking of you, too.  Bye all. ",3576915.200408031.male.15.txt

1,"You wanna know why this girl looks how she looks?  Well this poor little girl was forced by me to talk with me  for more than an hour.  Hmm you wonder why I did this?  Well lets start with the background  Since Simon (a class mate of mine) invited us to a grill party, this became a tradition. The photo was taken at such a party and me being very drunk started  to talk to every girl telling her such great things like  ""You're the horniest in our gradates!"" or ""You can run but I'll  always find you""  Well for this not being embarassing enough I looked for a victim I can talk to for longer time, well there she was!  This time I was in love with a chubby cheeked girl named Karen. Luckily my ""conversation partner"" was the best friend of her. So the conversation was only about how Karen and I match together.  You can imagine that me being very drunk said things, which I had better not said.  Finally I can only say that I don't remember all the stuff I told her, but my opinion about relationships and what is important in such relationships were the best things I told her, because now everybody knows what a horny  guy I am with my 17 years.  Well this evening seemed to be a turning point of my imagination for a  relationship with Karen, because later she wanted to clear some things, between me and her. This resulted in a telephone conversation for about nearly two hours. The only thing I can conclude from this session is that she is an ecological cunt, who thinks that she is something better than others.  One reason, which lets me conclude so is that a friend of her told me that Good-naturedness was the only reason why she talked to me.  Well I didn't knew that every person, who talks to me is just good natured. I don't think that conversation is a thing of Good-naturedness, because if so the world will get egoistically and it will become a privilege to talk to someone else.  Sorry but here it seems that sombebody stayed too long in the broad sunlight. Maybe she planted too many patches, which is what she does right at the moment :D  This is it for now, I hope you enjoyed reading this and I hope I could give you a small view of my life.

0,"The Irony of Loneliness in an Overpopulated World As I spend more time in the presence of depression, I've tried to apply a further focus to understand what's actually going on in my head. Dealing with the sudden appearance of depression has been a nightmare and a half to deal with to say the least. So in response, I regularly attempt to interpret the spiral of self loathing thoughts and whirlwind of emotions that march throughout my mind. My initial reaction to a diagnosis of major depression and multiple failed suicide attempts has been to run away from everything that reeks of painful memories, both theoretically and literally: * I write this post 7,000 kilometres from my home country, in Japan, where I aim to live for the next couple of years. * ‎I've ghosted those whom I use to call my close friends. * I left all social media in order to avoid contacting people that I knew, and because looking at how happy other people were brought me down. * ‎I changed my image drastically over the past year as an outward expression of the fact that I'm trying to change as a person. It's here in Japan that I've come to a terrifying realisation. I can't run from depression. Here I am, in a country where people speak a totally different language and immersed in a totally different culture to my own, writing a post about depression. Recently, I was walking the streets in search for job opportunities when I sunk into a depressed mood and began thinking about my place in the world (which always turns out well). Nothing actually matters. We work in order to pay rent, in order to stay in the same place, so that we can reliably keep a job so that we can pay rent. It's in this meaninglessness that humans as social beings look to others for comfort. Our lives are but a meaningless speck in an expanding universe. That's quite the depressing thought... And it is. But why is it that when another body's lying on top of mine, or when I'm held in a warm embrace, this thought doesn't have any impact on me? I've done quite a bit of thinking by myself,  and have talked to a bunch of people from back in the psychiatric ward on what 'fixes' us. And the unfortunate answer for most of us is... Nothing. We can't be fixed. It's just how our minds work. But what if we don't have to be fixed? The hardest part about depression for me, is the intensity of the loneliness I feel. When I'm at my worst, I'm so focused on my own loneliness and the meaninglessness of my relationships, that the few connections I do have, I dismiss. Now, this isn't the case for all people suffering from depression. For a lot of people, their negative emotions are driven by a sense of worthlessness,  meaninglessness or sadness. But the general consensus is, although we can't 'fix' ourselves, we can have people around us to support us when we're at our lowest. And it makes sense that as social beings, human intimacy provides us with a safety net for when depression's hitting us the hardest. Unfortunately for most of us, the type of physical and emotional intimacy that we strive for is unobtainable. In my life, depression's caused me to push away the people that I've spent time building connections with, and has limited the amount of contact I've had with strangers and people that I COULD connect with. I think it's ironic. It's ironic that in such an overpopulated world, depression is such a big issue. We're the people that need intimacy the most, so you'd think we'd be in a position where intimacy is more readily available. But that's not how the world works. Our lives are still meaningless. We still hate ourselves. And we're still alone. ",SKMojo99.txt

0,"Zoloft made me fly off the handle I have episodes of clinical depression that last a few weeks alternating with episodes of being euphoric, having so much energy, and thinking I am the greatest person in the world and I have superpowers. It’s awesome but has issues of its own because I tend to make poor choices, act conceited/rude without realizing it, and sometimes get angry. I was on Zoloft for a short time (age 11-12) and it made me a little less depressed but caused me to do horrible things impulsively, act spoiled and stuck up, and have frequent fits of rage. I attempted suicide within the first month of taking meds. I developed anorexia, made poor sexual and financial decisions, and was fired from my Saturday job as a babysitter because I was yelling at the kids, teaching them how to swear and bragging about it to other teachers, and trying to flirt with the children’s fathers. At school I told everyone I had superpowers and raged at them when they said that my superpowers were not real. I had arguments with my parents and pulled out a knife to threaten them at one point. I had a boyfriend but was still flirting with other boys constantly including my teachers. I tried to “rapebait” by going into the house of a suspected molester/murderer/drug dealer but was stopped thankfully. After going off meds I crashed and burned HARD.

Lately I’ve been hoping that i don’t wake up from my sleep. In the past six months, I’ve lost two people that I loved so much. One was my best friend of 8 years, we dated for a year and broke up but remained friends until about six months ago. He started to ignore me out of no where. Tried my best to talk to him but... he was the cause of why my depression spiraled back so bad that I almost took my own life. Then I met another guy about 5 months earlier... he liked me, I liked him, I fell in love with him. He knew of my ex/best friend and what he did to me. Guy number two said he wouldn’t do what guy number one did to me... and now I feel like he is doing the same exact thing that guy number one did to me... we haven’t talked in two weeks. I know two weeks isn’t that long to not talk, but... seeing as guy number one didn’t talk to me for two weeks...

1,"Should Social Security be run by the government? Is government good at doing that sort of thing? When I attended a student meeting with one of the chair's of the Fed (in NYC) he said that there are two things that the US has to worry about economically in the future. The first is the trade deficit turning over and the second is the retirement of the baby boomers. Now I read your (MWS) post to Joe Crow about SS' funding till 2040 but the best estimates I can find (the only economist I can find who says otherwise is Paul Krugman from the NYTimes, so maybe I'm off base since he's a superb economist) state that under the pay-as-you-go system within a dozen years the retirement benefits mandated by current law will exceed SS payroll taxes. So we're talking about tax increases within our (or at least my) lifetime (Fortune article called it The $44 Trillion Abyss).  Now, as you mentioned earlier, any serious student of human nature has to look at the world realistically. When you put a social safety net (just like free health care) in place, what's gonna happen? It will be overused...that is human nature unless people are given a clever incentive to do otherwise (I leave wiggle room here in case I’m forced to recant later). People are going to plan on using it, not everybody, not all the time, but those guys on the margin of making a decision on savings will tend to take this retirement benefit into account and, god forbid, plan on it. The system is going to HAVE TO handle the stress from the poor and disabled AS WELL AS the free riders. Now, that's not say that SS is altogether bad, socializing some costs is important, but the pay-as-you-go system is totally ridiculous! You get one guy who knows about accounting and one guy who knows about demographics in a room together and they'll tell you something's got to give: either taxes go up or benefits go down or a little of both. Maybe another variant would work better, but the most libertarians I meet get annoyed when their children’s futures are being taxed away before their eyes.

1,"[Need Advice] best friend (21f) moving in with my dad (dad age) and I (21f) My best friend and I have talked about living together plenty of times. Now it’s really happening because her family is moving out of state and she has nowhere to go. My dad and I live in an apartment together and share expenses (though he pays for most of it). It’s a pretty good situation, but there are anxieties we both have about my friend moving in. She is unemployed and has been for a while. The deal was that she could move in once she got a job (the deal was made like 7 months ago), but she is still jobless and her family is leaving in 3 days. We’re letting her move in, and luckily her mom is willing to help out with her expenses until she gets a job. But here are the worries: • She had a lot of time before this to get a job, what if she takes even more time even after she’s moved in? My dad and I know from experience how difficult getting a job can be, but also expected her to have one by now. The thing is, she’s very picky (even when she can’t afford to be). She won’t just take any job, she’s only applying to places she’d prefer to work at. Which I totally get! But at some point you just gotta do something even if you hate it, it won’t last forever and will even help you get to doing something you don’t hate. She’s repeatedly said that she’s “not the kind of person that can work a job she doesn’t like”. And that is definitely making it take longer for her to find work. But what can ya do? • Another thing is, my dad and I (my dad especially) have had not-so-great experiences with friends/acquaintances moving in. That’s definitely made both of us have some not-so-great feelings about this situation (even if it may end up being really good!). A lot of things can ruin this and it’s hard to know how to avoid those things while still being a friend. It’s a thin thin line. • my dad and I (my dad more than me) are also worried about compatibility. My dad and I get along great and it’s been no problem for us to live together. We have an unspoken agreement on bills, chores, privacy, etc. It just works. How can we keep that agreement while including a whole new person who might not think the same way? For instance, I don’t know much about the way she lives. I know how it’s been with her family, but things are different when you leave home. It’s tough to say how it will be, but my dad is worried that she won’t be the kind of clean, kind, generous person he expects a friend/roomie to be. It’s tough because I agree with him.. • there’s the other matter of an official Roommate Agreement that could be made and signed by the 3 of us. We all think it’s a great idea, but I know how things can still get messy (literally and figuratively) when living with a friend. The problems that can arise are endless and maybe some even unavoidable. All we want is for things to work out well, with the least amount of issues as possible. Communication is key and that’s the goal of this Roommate Agreement. However, there is still that line that we do not want to cross. I want this move-in to be professional as well as friendly. How can my dad and I make the rules clear so that she will take them very seriously without this being like some kind of crazy contract? Thanks for even reading this! ",NyaAndersonsLies.txt

All of them are single. Well, at least one of them is somewhat single. The less-single one is Charlotte. Charlotte has a new beau, who she has been seeing on the low for about two months.

Melanie goes with her, and Charlotte, reluctantly buys the best dress she can find, but it is not nearly as fabulous as the first dress she ordered online - which, again, won't arrive on time. The ladies planned to all go to Melanie's house early on the day of NYE to slowly get ready, play some good music, eat pizza and have a few drinks before they summon the Uber to take them to the party. The night before, however, the party's promoters announce on facebook that the venue has changed to another location. A little aggravating, but not a big deal.

1,"My Friend is Draining Me Apologies, this is a very long post! I’ve been good friends with a girl for around 10 years since we were teenagers. She moved overseas around 5 years ago. She used to be such a fun, bubbly and funny person until she met her boyfriend around 3 years ago. Looking back, I can see that she was a always bit crazy and insecure (her father is emotionally abusive and tells her she’s worthless and stupid), but meeting him seems to have exacerbated all her bad qualities. She has a really low self esteem and perception issues when it comes to relationships. She also has OCD. She was, and still is OBSESSED with her now ex boyfriend. They had an on off relationship where she thought it was normal to call him “just ten times” in one day, and would get upset and not be able  “sleep or eat” if he doesn’t reply, thinks talking on the phone three times a day is not much, they pushed and shoved each other, she hit him, he talked to other girls and acted like she wasn’t his girlfriend, she’d call his voicemail just to hear his voice, he threatened to hurt her, she considered going to a shitty college just to be near him, etc.. basically an abusive and obsessive relationship with awful communication. Every time she messages me, she’ll ask how I am and ask a few questions, and then steer the conversation back to her numerous problems and her ex. About how she’s so poor (goes out every second night and goes on shopping sprees), how she’s really sad (but won’t see a counselor because she’s “too poor”), how she wants to be confident and independent (goes back to the ex repeatedly and doesn’t listen to any of the advice I give her), tells me she can’t eat or sleep because she’s heartbroken (I told her I was eventually okay after I broke up with an ex, but she brushed it off as I hadn’t gone out with him for as long and how she gave everything to her ex). She also says how I’m so lucky to live with my boyfriend and how I have such an amazing life, as if she’s the only person in the world that has problems. I’ve talked to her multiple times about how talking about her ex all the time and her problems is effecting me (as well as her other friends), and how she should really see a professional as this behavior is really hurting her. She always apologizes and says that she didn’t realize how it might make me annoyed, and she’ll send me an inspirational video or inspirational words, and asking about me before going back to changing the topic so she can talk about herself, her ex and how it’s so hard for her right now, how she feels suffocated and her heart is broken. I understand that people go through hard times in their lives, but this has lasted at least 3 years. I’ve always said how I’ll be there for her and that if she needs to talk to someone, I’ll listen, but I’m starting to feel that this is a one way relationship. The frustrating thing is that she says she agrees to everything I say, and how’s shes going to change, but nothing has changed! She says she’s more confident and doing this and that to help herself, but she just plasters selfies and videos of herself going out with people to try and convince people that she’s having an amazing time. I don’t want to just ignore her, but I don’t think talking to her again will do anything. I’ve been nice, brutally honest, and even angry at her and nothing has changed. She’s stuck in her own tragic world and I’m realizing that maybe she thrives in this drama, and that she’s lonely and needs a boyfriend’s attention to validate her self worth . Our other mutual friend has cut ties with her due to this. I think I have put up with this for so long as we’re not living in the same country.. Sorry about the long rant and formatting, I’m on my cellphone. TL;DR friend who lives overseas is emotionally draining me every time I talk to her. I have already talked to her about it multiple times, but she always goes back to her old ways. ",Solostrn.txt

0,"I feel like nothing works or will work out, can someone relate? It‘s always like I try something and want to better myself, have high expectations and then life comes, uppercuts me, spits on me and just screams „You thought, bitch“. I had a really good therapist but she suddenly quit due to illness. I had to wait several months until I got the final answer. Had no therapy in that time between and also we only had like 6 sessions. Now I have a therapist who is ok but I just don‘t vibe with her that much. And I can‘t change because of insurance. Nor do I have the money to pay for one myself since I‘m a broke ass student. I told her once that I don‘t want solutions. I want someone to genuienly understand me. At first she tried and now it’s all solutions again. „Try this, try that, we need to experiment“. I get the thought but I feel like my deep down feelings are just irrelevant once again. My first therapist really understood me and listened. I could cry my heart out and afterwards I felt so much lighter. I really miss that feeling. Now it‘s just an obligation I have to do. Back then I never used to come late to my therapy sessions because I really looked forward to it. But now I am constantly running late because deep down, I just don‘t want to go anymore and give up. I don‘t have energy for that. I also took anti depressants (Tianeurax if anyone knows that one). At first it helped me, especially with processing feelings. But then I turned super suicidal and had mental breakdowns over mental breakdowns. I completly stopped and now I feel numb again. I want to feel suicidal and emotional again, to be honest. At least I processed something. Now I feel empty and dead inside once again, like how I used to be all the years before I started therapy and taking anti depressants. My „new“ therapist asked me what I can bear more. My suicidal state or this passive suicidal state. I told her the last one. But honestly, I want it to be the first one. At least I felt like a human. At least some people cared because they were afraid I‘d do something to myself. Now no one cares. I‘m alone. I don‘t go outside anymore. I‘m just isolating myself again. No one really talks to me and I‘m just a bother to everyone. I honestly think about taking my anti depressants again, just to get suicidal and off myself. Despite often being a bad actor, I am just so well at playing this role of „Of course, I will try! I will do my best“. I‘m good at pretending nothing bother‘s me and everything‘s fine. I‘m good at pretending to say „Wow, your advice helped me so much, thank you for listening!“. But I‘m just a fraud. Nothing helps. Afterwards I just want to die more. Sometimes I ask myself, why the hell do I even put up with all of this. The only reason why I haven‘t killed myself yet is because it‘d financially ruin my family. I don‘t even care about emotions, I doubt it‘d be that bad. No one likes me anyway. Just so they don‘t get into debt with my death or sth. I often find myself also thinking that I will never leave a goodbye letter or tell them goodbye. Because no one cares anyway. I told them many times before why I want to die. I don‘t feel like anyone deserves that anyway because they don‘t put as much energy into me as I put into them. Whenever I feel like it goes up, it just crumbles down. I really don‘t know how much of this I can take. I‘ve been like this since 6 years old. I‘m 21 now. I don‘t know why I got thrown into this world when I‘m ridden and infested with mental illnesses.

1,"I've got to go watch my favorite television shows, so I'll be brief.    As a conservative, I'm more than a little fed up with the liberal bias in the media. Disgusted isn't really the right word-I'm disgusted with the blatant anti-Americanism of the flag-burning war protestors, I'm disgusted with the self-absorbed corruption at the UN-but the media bias...it can best be compared to a child singing an annoying song, incessantly, over and over again. They're AWARE that they're injecting bias into their news. They're AWARE that it's wrong. However, they're not going to stop doing it...because on one level, the annoying song-singing child enjoys singing the song, on another, it enjoys annoying the people around it. Eh, that's the best comparison I can come up with on such short notice.   Perusing the internet a couple of years back, I came across this wonder of wonders: THE BLOG. Conservatives around the nation had taken opportunity of this new miracle of technology to protest the liberal media. Good for them.   Since then, both the media and the celebrities around the nation have turned up the heat on their criticism of Bush, all the while proclaiming that there was a 'chill wind' of repression silencing them. Such sheer pretentiousness on their part served to give me a headache for a few hours, but nothing more.   However, they've begun to go to far. They've gone beyond the realm of 'bias' into the realm of 'propaganda.' I realized this after I was able to deconstruct the basis of a Time magazine article ('How we got Homeland Security wrong) with a calculator, access to google, and no more than five minutes of my own time. When something like this happens-when a trusted and widely read magazine starts putting out bullshit that can be disproved with eighth-grade research and math skills...well, things have gotten pretty bad.   Instead of sitting around and bitching about it, I've decided to throw my weight into the fight, by starting this blog. Whenever I can, I'll point out liberal media innaccuracies. Whenever I want to, I'll write opinion pieces.   However, unlike the mainstream media, I'll be honest with you. This Blog will be replete with right-wing bias, ranging from moderate to, as the media would put it, 'extreme.'   Thank you. ",3974221.200407190.male.17.txt

A guy I have been close friends with for the last 13 years is getting married this year and I've come to the realisation that I'm not invited to the wedding. To be honest, we are not as close as we used to be. We used to hang out all time, but as lives became busy, we spent less time together. I still attend almost all of his social gatherings, though that is probably only 3 to 4 times a year. The weird thing is, I was invited to his engagement party. I got him and his partner a really meaningful gift that they still comment on whenever they see me, yet they didn't invite me the wedding. When I was slightly intoxicated at another friend's girls night some time ago, I asked the bride if invites had been sent out yet because I couldn't remember receiving mine. We then began the awkward exchange in which she told me it was really hard to narrow down the guest list and I realised I was never getting my invite. I tried to act as if I wasn't offended and that I understood, but honestly, I'm really hurt. I've been invited to the hen's night which is in a month. It is not a cheap night. Upwards of $200 for accommodation, games etc. It feels rude to expect me to pay so much to attend a hen's night when they wouldn't even pay for me to be a guest at their wedding.

0,"My weight is ballooning out of control. I take daily: 40 MG of Prozac (in the morning);  1 MG Klonopin (same time): 1 MG Klonopin (5 PM) 1 MG Klonopin (bedtime), prescribed by a psychiatrist. I also take 1000 MG Keppra at bedtime for migraine prevention (prescribed by a neurologist). I've been on various combinations of these for a couple of years. The psychiatrist is doggedly insistent that the medications I'm on shouldn't be making me gain weight - but nonetheless they are.  I've had other medications that have given me side effects that I ""shouldn't"" have had - but nonetheless I do. I have read many, many stories on the internet and through direct conversation with others that say they have had exactly the same things happen with SSRI's. When I've asked him to change the medication, he keeps preaching ""diet and exercise"".  It hasn't worked.  I'm now down to the point where I eat virtually nothing and today I exercised to the point where I nearly blacked out. This is causing problems between my wife and I (she also sees the same psychiatrist and takes Klonopin and Effexor), not least because I have no sexual desire.  None. She sees him (the psychiatrist) tomorrow but I don't see him until April 6. Yesterday in my therapy session I had an angry outburst that maybe I should just quit taking all the medication (because maybe I'm over medicated) and she didn't like that too much.

1,"I used to eat strawberry chapstick when I was a kid. When I say eat, I'm talking roll up the tube and take bites of it. I also used to have tragically chapped lips. I would always ask my dad for a new tube when we were in the checkout line of the grocery store and he kept buying them until he realized that no human can go through chapstick that quickly if you use it in the conventional way. Perhaps the fact that my lips could have been used as an alternative to sand paper gave it away and he soon found out about my snacking habits and refused to buy me anymore chapstick.  Now many years later, I have a slight obsession with chapstick and other lip products and if I may say so myself, I also have wonderfully soft lips. But, I have recently concluded that the ingestion of strawberry chapstick has lead to my many neuroses (we'll get into them a little later). I suppose they could have come from my parents divorce, my mom's abusive remarriage, the teasing I endured at school, some chemical imbalance or maybe even the time I crashed my tricycle and whacked my head on the concrete, but I've decided I like blaming it on chapstick instead.  It wasnt until a few years ago that I realized I really did have some strange neuroses and that most other people have very few or even none. In the last few months, I've noticed that they effect me more that I ever thought. I used to think ""oh thats just a quirk about me"" or ""hey, everyone is a little crazy about some things"".  I am not a lunatic by any means and most of my ""quirks"" are internal and really only effect me, but because I know I was not ALWAYS this way, it has really lead me to wonder *When does a person become who they are going to be and when is it too late to go back?*  Of course you can get some therapy or take some medication to rid you of many issues you may have, but after you have grown and matured enough to even realize you have issues then wouldnt any kind of ""intervention"" change WHO YOU are or force you to go through live pretending that you are someone else after you have been ""cured""?

1,"Having troubles reconnecting with an old friend. Aloha Reddit. So I'm a guy and I'm trying to reconnect with an old female friend of mine. Long story short, she stopped talking to me and then I stopped talking to her but she thought I was the one who stopped talking to her and so we ignored eachother for three years even though we go to the same school. Recently, I texted her saying that I apologize. She said that she'd give me a second chance, so I start texting her questions to get to know her again, but she takes hours to answer and when she does answer, all she says is ""Yes/no, you?"" When I ask her a question and ""Haha ok"" when I answer my own question. She even leaves me on read sometimes. Should I stop texting her? I really don't understand why she decided to give me a second chance if she won't even try to support the conversation. Just saying ""Sorry, I don't wanna talk to you anymore"" would've been a lot less painful. ",elksaremagic.txt

1,"My opinion on peoples   faith   is   different  . I dont think that anyone can determine how much faith someone has, and I dont think that other people should   judge   someone elses faith. God is apart of   everyone's life   one way or another.   Mostly   everyone knows who God is and the principles behind Him. I think that the way that people   deny   Christ's name so easily is  wrong , but Im not them, so I cant make their decisions for them. But what I can do, is I can work my hardest to be a Godly   example   so that they can see what the Christian life is all about. Being a Christian   isnt   always   fun  . Yes, there are always the occansionally   disappointment   that we run into and from what I have heard, alot of people   blame God   for their   mishaps  . Well, as hard as this might sound, its all apart of God's   master plan  . God allows some misfortunes to happen, to   test   your level of faith that you might have in Him.

1,"Abusive dad or I'm just toxic... Two weeks ago, my dad lost our dog. It went to the shelter but due to the microchip ownership issue, we have to wait two weeks to get her. I told my family that there's a chance that we might not get the dog back. My dad then started saying how it's fate that the dog is gone and that if we can't get it back then it's destiny. I got annoyed and said ""But really, it's because you weren't being careful and you left her at the park"". He then started yelling at me. Saying he's the only one who walks the dog. I then said I walk the dogs as well, I just don't do it enough because I'm the only one in the family who works from morning to night, paying for the bills, groceries and everything. He then claimed that it's not his fault and then started saying how if someone told him to look after their child and he accidently killed it, would it be his fault. I responded with yes, it is your fault because it's under your duty of care. Anyway, things got ugly from there. I didn't speak to him for a week. He got my sister to ask me to pay for his bills and fines. I paid for the $500 one today this morning. Then he asked to borrow my car, and I lent it to him. After that, he came back and started throwing passive jabs at me by talking to the dog. e.g. ""Bailey, you're lucky that I'm here. If i wasn't here, you would've died a long time ago. Some people just know how to talk and don't do shit."" I got annoyed and said you lost the dog. Get over it. He then yelled at me. I got annoyed and told him to fuck off. He then started saying ""wow, you're being so disrespectful. God will punish you. I wish you die and I wish you'll live out your life alone."" I then said ""You came home and started a fight for no reason. Don't play the victim when I argue back"". He then said ""I'm just talking to myself. You don't have to listen to me."" I then said ""Go talk to the wall then."" I shut the door and continue with my business. He then walked next to my door and started going on and on about how I'll die soon for being disrespectful and that god will send a lightning bolt to hit me. I then angrily snapped at him saying ""I may or may not die before you, but I can bet that if you die, no one in this fucking world would mourn for you"". I then shut the door, and I didn't hear anything from him again. Not sure if I have a abusive father or I'm just toxic or maybe it's both. I don't want to live like this anymore. ",renewreborn.txt

1,"Hearing my parents doing naughty things at night scars me. Hey guys, my name is Sally. I'm seventeen this year and it's 5am right now at where I live. I don't know how to phrase my words as my head is in a mess. To provide some background story about myself, my family live in a compact flat and as a result, I sleep with my parents. In the bedroom, my parents sleep on the bed while I sleep on a mattress beside their bed. When I had nightmares when I was younger, I would squeeze in between them and only then, could I fall asleep. As I got older, when I would replicate doing the same thing when I had nightmares, I would get scolded instead. That's how the bed was - just enough for 2 adults and 1 kid-sized human, I guess? So I don't recall when - perhaps it was a year ago, when I heard the bed shaking continuously from my father's actions. He was also breathing heavily and there was this sticky sound too. Gross enough, I know. At that point of time, I was already mature enough to assume that he was masturbating. It was enough to scar me though, because it was just so strange to think of your dad fapping in the middle of the night, in the same room as his daughter. I pretended that I was asleep, but that was a really shitty experience tbvh. I tried to convince myself that he was doing something else, like rubbing his nose, and brushed it off. I just refused to accept that he might be doing something so dirty and it took me so many years of my life to actually realise it? What?! Alright so today, I found out that not only does my dad engage in that sort of behaviour, so does my mum. I'm shocked lol. I don't know how I should go about knowing this. I searched for some advice on Google too, and I now learnt that it's supposed to be 'normal'? Is it so common? I'm so shooked because I thought my family were a conservative bunch. I'm their youngest child, and I thought they would have stopped all perverted acts since I was born. So how did I find out? I suddenly woke up to hear my dad shaking the entire bed again. This time, I was really unaware and asked my dad to shut up. Suddenly, my mum nagged at me slightly and I was so confused. My mum went to the washroom and started showering? Which was so odd and made no sense. And from the corner of my eye, I saw my dad wearing his underwear and pants! He slipped them on so easily I thought it might have been a daily practice for them. He zipped up his pants naturally and it came as an instant realisation to me that both of them were engaging in some indecent shit. What. The. Actual. Fuck. I slept in the same room with them for 17 years, and today I found out that both of them have been doing messed up shit and I was completely oblivious, up until today. It's so scarring, and I remember myself pretending I'm asleep. I knew before that my mum didn't wear a bra to sleep, but I really didn't know it might be more than just because it was more comfortable to sleep without one. Lmao. I'm really shocked at how they are doing things like this while I'm asleep. In the same room. And my dad makes such obvious sounds, I think it's sick. The thought of it disgusts me. I heard somewhere before that all men fap, regardless their age. Is it true? I'm starting to feel crept out, that men are so hormonal LOL. I suddenly feel so pure and this entire thought of my parents being naughty is scarring asf. Thoughts, anybody? ",junnaquack.txt

I am now 42, run my own business and just started Prozac late December & seeing a psychologist in late Nov.

This anxiety and depression has definitely affected my relationship with my wife & kids. Most times when you're at work you want to be home & vice versa, really don't know what you want. I do not feel like talking to anyone & have cut off most of my good friends. I understand most men do not want to admit they have a problem until their wife leaves them and it's too late.

0,"Any advice on how to handle leaving my only friend? LAST thing I need right now is the pain but I think I have to. I've posted here a few times before and never got much for replies, which is ok.  I really do hope I can get some insight on this particular issue however. For so long I've been completely alone and it really sucked.  I managed to connect with my Cousin a couple of years ago and we've had a lot of great times, but more often than not lately it seems I feel bad after dropping her off instead of good that we hung out. We've hung out like 3 times a week for a couple years now.  I feel like we have a real connection but she doesn't show it if she feels the same. I'm an alcoholic and so is she, so we drink together a lot.  I certainly would be able to quit if I didn't have to drink to be around her.  Besides the booze I have no idea what other drugs she's into; I know coke for sure, probably smoking crack time to time, she's made jokes about wanting to go out and do meth all night. She's CONSTANTLY lying to me about everything. She is so very unreliable, in the last 2 weeks twice now she's made plans with me for the next day, only to show up on facebook at like 8pm after I've been sitting and waiting for her all day and then she gets angry with me for telling her it makes me feel like shit. Everything is always about her, she's even more depressed than me and has none of the coping skills I do so most of the time it's just her bringing up all her problems and me trying to reassure her.  If I try to talk about my issues though she pays no attention and changes the subject. I know she's not really a ""friend"" more of a ""company prostitute"" if anything, it seems like I'm always having to buy the booze or lend her money she never pays back.  I know I am being blatantly used, but the company is still better than being alone with my thoughts all of the time. She actually ""ghosted"" me about a year ago for a few months and that put me in a really bad place, I had to check into the psych ward I was in such a rut over it.  When we finally started hanging out again she didn't seem to care at all the pain it caused me, and I still have never heard an answer ""why"" she'd block me and dodge my calls or visits out of the blue. I feel like she's getting worse and no matter how hard I try I can't help her or make her seem to care. I don't think I can handle the pain of losing my ""friend"" again.  I also have OCD and I obsess on things to ridiculous lengths and this is going to suck me into a dark hole for a long time. I suppose I actually came here hoping people would tell me not to ditch her, but I know I can't keep letting her treat me like this. How do I do it on good terms? How do I get over it and not let the grief consume me? Please help. ",user1444.txt

My only friend at the time gets sick and goes home early. 14th birthday: All my friends but one bail on me.

0,"Failure to trust ‘’those on my side’’. [possible trigger Warning] I find myself incapable of trusting my spouse. I’ve been with my SO for nearly 15 years, 7 married this year, we have 3 children. Before I hit my mid-teens I’d been through nearly a decade of sexual abuse within the already dysfunctional household I grew up one, with an alcoholic father and a narcissistic mother. I met my now spouse when I was 17. He had been in a two year relationship with a girl a few years his senior, which left him broken after her infidelity. And I… well I lived day to day, carrying what I could. I’ll never forgot how I coldly and factually told him with a mere two sentences what I had to endure, telling him that if he did chose me, he would be settling for a lifetime shared with a woman with severe ups and downs due to her limited mental strength. He convinced me to go for it and I wept in his arms. That was probably the first time in my life someone did not look the other way and I allowed myself to be vulnerable, instead of distant and cold. I opened myself up to him. Few years later my home situation imploded. I ran. His mother took me under her wing, I think she was the first parental figure I could lean on in my life. His father loathed me as the girl from the slums, threatening me in private to never marry his son. Reminding me of my lowly descent when he could. He would never come to accept me fully but at least fully respects me in public, which to me is commendable enough. Afterwards I started living with my now SO, still during our teens in a studio. The idea was triggered and pushed for by me as a solution after a bout of infidelity on his side after he moved to study in a city a couple hours away. He partook in intimate relations with a girl he knew from another country over webcam due to ‘’loneliness’’ and held the act in the same regards as watching porn whereas I didn’t. We tried to work things out. As we did my view of him started to crumble, but was rebuilt after living together surprisingly worked remarkably well. We grew more towards each other and were best friends on top of lovers. In between this life changing chapter and where I am now, he has had a few strikes I simply can not forget. While I was once open to share my ups and downs and sadness with him, now I’d rather not. Because where I once trusted him to hold me, I now trust him to ridicule me and tell me to man the fuck up. And the stubborn ass I am, I do, but this comes with resentment. But to explain the strikes: - One is where I was crying after having particularly bad and involuntary memories. Annoyed by my state and stressed by upcoming finals he asked me: When is this going to end? You’re always spinning the same old tales, you’re driving yourself insane. - Another was when he screamed out while we had visitors: How would you like it if I told everyone you were raped? He believed I had done something utterly despicable, blame was pinned upon me by one of his siblings. In that moment something broke, the attack was 100% unwarranted. So much trust lost. When he figured out I had done nothing to him the apologies came swift and numerous. - One was when I asked him for a letter. He will always buy flowers on special occasions, which I hate. They wither and die. I just hate the sentiment, I dislike it and I have communicated this. I wanted something which lasts. A reminder. All I wanted was a letter. Years I secretly yearned for one but received flowers instead, which I still tended to. Finally… I asked for a letter. He refused and told me point blank to my face he would not. That it was silly I needed something to hold onto, and that this item would become something of an unhealthy obsession. - The latest strike was after I endured a panic attack while I was on my own, which I managed myself before he returned home. He was upset when I confided in him and he stated: I will not be on your side if you are mentally ill. I will choose our children and make sure they grow up with stability. (Later he corrected himself and stated that if I was to turn schizophrenic or manic, he would have me committed and divorce me, but would support me through depression and anxiety). Now to me a panic attack is something manageable if you are equipped to deal with it. Through the years I have learned to be aware of my surroundings and triggers and to be prepared to deal with anything since I am responsible for my children. I have no history of hysterical or erratic behavior, so I found his reaction to my first ever panic attack very… crude. I have my pride even through my depression for what I have survived and what I have accomplished. But I hate that I can not find it in myself again to open up towards my spouse and more than often find myself crying when I am capable to, so I can put up my smile and brave face when I NEED to. I’ve successfully faked it till I made it. And of the 15 years that we have been together the good by far outweighs the bad, something which can not be conveyed well enough in this post. But what has been said can be never taken back. Even though recently he said: Don't you understand after 15 years I am on your side? I understand. I hate that I can’t be vulnerable anymore. I hate that the trust is gone, and the resentment grows. If anyone has advice or a similar story of lost trust, I’d just love to hear and talk about it, if only to gain some perspective.

I guess this is one more step I'm trying out to kind of ease myself into the whole thing. People told me 10 years ago to stick with it because it'll get better. They still tell me that even though I would love to go back 10 years now because of how much worse its gotten and how much better even that was compared to now. I didn't think it would get this bad but it did. I've been through so many medications, doctors, checked myself into a hospital 3 times when I was sure I was going to do kill myself, called the suicide hotline several times, talked with friends, made lifestyle changes and all that. It still didn't work. I've only gotten more depressed. There's no helping me. I am just supposed to feel miserable. I'll never be happy. I'm not sure at this point if I even want to be happy anyways. Hoping I can work up the courage to kill myself by the end of today. I'm really scared to do it but its something I really need to do for my own sake. ",Lordbobsaget.txt

I have spent the last 11 years (since 15) sabotaging my own success. I'm now  in full self-destruct mode. No anti-depressant works for me. Every medication makes me miserable and sick unless it is a stimulant, and I don't want to be stuck on stimulants. I used to drink as a crutch and now I can't. My husband and I were separated and moved back in together. He is an addict too and going through withdrawal, so he is extra-sensitive. My ex decided that it would be a great time to blackmail me with Facebook statuses and tag my husband in them. I didn't tell my spouse about the blackmail because of the potential fallout, because things were finally good. Now I realize I just hurt him worse. Needless to say... he is pissed. It just makes things worse. I have no motivation at work. Therapy is not working and I need a new therapist, but I don't have the energy or self-love to care enough to do anything about my issues. I am in a black hole when everyone thinks I live a charmed life. I have been depressed since I was five years old and I don't know how long I can hold on without losing it. What do I even do?

0,"I don't think who try to kill themselves actually want to die From my experience and one of a close friend who almost died in a car accident, I think people don't really want to die. We just want the pain to go away. All the shit we take  and all the heavy baggage we have to carry, just makes us tired and lose hope When we ponder on death, we see an easy way out, so as to get rid of the unbearable agony we suffer. Moreover, I watched a video of suicide survivors. About those 7% who survived suicide, claimed that in their final moments, when they were throwing themselves from a high place, they said they'd regret everything and wanted to live. Now imagine all those who died and regretted in the last moments. Personally, I've been close to do it, but my online friends gave me so much support and so much love that I noticed that it's not worth it. I still have things I want to do. Sure getting out of bed is still a huge task. Today it took me 2 hours just to do it, but I did it. I'm not sure if I should have posted this in suicide or here as it has to do with both.

The bad news is that I am still wearing this silly brace and using a cane.

I could have broken my leg or completely torn the LCL. It could have been my right leg and I wouldn't be able to drive.   So much for paddling this summer.

0,Hi. My name is Jenna. I'm 20 years old and just joined and figured that I should introduce myself. I found this site from searching online and think that it's great. I only started accepting the fact that I've been depressed last year because I've always been very good at hiding it from everyone else and I used to fool myself as well (if that makes sense). I've never been one to seek help from others because in the past I've always dealt with everything myself. The start of college and being outside (different state) of my home environment (which is the cause of a lot of anger and resentment that I also have) helped me to see that there was something wrong with the way that I was living and that I could reach out and get help. I'm currently seeing a counselor (through my college and since I feel like I'm working well with her that I don't need to seek other outside help yet) about my anxiety and depression but I feel that talking to others that are going through the same thing could help give me a different view on everything and be helpful as well.

1,"My friend is dating my friend's rapist. my friend, let's call her 'b' is very troubled. i've known her for years and she's always had very severe depressive, suicidal and destructive tendencies. recently, it had gotten to the point where our friendship was struggling because it always felt like i had to be looking for her constantly and making sure she wasn't literally running away to commit suicide (and if i wasn't there for her all the time i felt like a bad friend). anyway, she started talking to this boy (let's name him 's') who I knew fairly well for many bad reasons. He was dating b and I's friend (named 'e') for a long period, and tldr, he was extremely abusive and raped her multiple times during their relationship. B was friends with E. Recently, B decided to begin dating S (after lying about meeting him repeatedly over a couple days period). I cut off the friendship but she kept trying to speak to me as I didn;t think she got my point of not wanting to be her friend but I think I've made it more clear in recent messages. It turns out B may have lied about a lot of things (to the point of manipulating me about my trauma, telling me certain people said things about me and didn't like me. she says they definitely said it but the people say otherwise so I don't know who to believe. she has extreme 'stories' that i don't know if are true anymore either). B thinks that me cutting off the friendship is to an extent not fair as it's not my business to make her choose between her now boyfriend and me. I disagree - she is dating our friend's rapist (well not her friend anymore) and I find it disgusting and I can't be friends with her due to this. Mostly, I am paranoid that I am.. well.. wrong. Overreacting, as it's not 100% to do with me - I was friends with him during him and E's relationship but not after I knew of the way he treated her.

In grade/year 8 or 9 I met two guys who are now great friends of mine, one I talk to more than the other since he stayed at home instead of at school due to health issues.

Now between year 10-11 I definitely noticed that Manny started taking more of my best mates interest, which makes sense and happens often so I didn't think of it. It only caught my attention when my best mate stopped inviting me to events such as hangouts at the park and going on cinema trips with my other friend who stays at home. Instead he would invite Manny and Manny would invite him and some of my other friends to many events like the cinema and sleepovers and whatnot. Over time I would be completely excluded from my friends activities and everytime invited them to do something, they would say ""im not sure if i can go"" only for me to find out they went with Manny somewhere.

1,"A friend of mine is being mean, or am I sensitive? A long time friend of mine (let’s call her Abby) has recently been a little cruel imo, but I’m not sure if it’s me. These three things happen in less than 2 days and now we’re not speaking. Also, we’re 14 and just started high school. 1: She laughed at my new haircut. I know that sounds frivolous, but Abby and this other girl were literally outright laughing. She claims she was just ‘being honest’. 2: She left me wandering. We had agreed to walk to an after school event together. She started walking without me and didn’t tell me, so I was walking around the high school, sending her a million messages trying to find her. I guessed she had left, but I didn’t want to ditch her if she hadn’t. I eventually just walked by myself. When I got there (late) it turned out she walked with two other girls (including the hair-laughing girl). When I called her out she said I was overreacting and that walking alone shouldn’t bother me (it didn’t, I was upset because she didn’t care about me) and that she wouldn’t care if the shoe was on the other foot. All I asked was that she apologize and next time *let me know* if she changed plans, which earned a sarcastic/sassy ‘we’ll sor-ry’. 3: Another friend of mine and Abby’s (it’s a trio friendship) asked to hang out (her name will be Robin). Abby didn’t come which I was kind of glad about, so it was just me and Robin. We walked around town and all. It wasn’t even very late (6:00) when this one group of guys (4 of them, 18ish) hollered at us from their car. At first we thought it was a prank, but it kept going. They did this multiple times, following us or looping back around to greet us. We were getting freaked out. So, when they loop back around again I’ve had enough. I yelled at them to F*** off. I thought this was smart. I figured they’d either realize we weren’t having fun or something. Surprise, surprise, it made things worse. A lot worse. Eventually, they got stuck at a light and we sprinted to a family members house nearby (who turned out had recently been hospitalized) and hid there until my Mom came. Now, I know the F off move was incredibly dumb. I made it worse not only for myself but for my friend. Either way, the next day I was feeling guilty as hell and worried about Robin and what she thought of me and was just stressed in general. Not in a good mood. I don’t even tell my friend what happened, she greets me with weird hints about last night. So I simply ask her to stop with these weird hints and actually talk to me. Basically, Robin told her about last night. So Abby being super nice says, to the best of my memory, “You realize your mistake, right? You understand that it was your fault. So just so you know, I have no sympathy at all.” I know I was dumb, but hearing this after everything and what I already blamed myself for being told so bluntly and harshly at me by my friend set me off. I left and actually went and cried in the girls washroom that I know no one ever uses. I’m not sure what I expected, it was my fault, but she *greeted* me like this. No, “Hey, I heard you were followed...” or ANYTHING. Just straight up “it’s your fault I have no sympathy.” Like, Hey, nice to see you too. Either way, we’re not talking anymore. I’ve tried to bring it up but it’s always, “I was just being honest... what did you expect? So you want me to lie? You’re being silly...” No acknowledgement. Also, this fight between me and Abby is affecting my friendship with Robin because it was a trio friendship. Also, Abby is my only friend at my school, I’m scared to be alone. Sorry for how long this is, I think it’s sort of a rant too. What should I do? Am I completely out of line? How should I go about fixing this? At the very least, how can I prevent this from affecting me and Robin? ",ravenfeather1234.txt
0,"I've realized that I made a big mistake by starting this blog. It serves no purpose to put feelings out for public view, so I've deleted the entries from the last six months. I was going to explain some things, but thought better of it. I think a small part of my old self has awakened again. I'm a bit ashamed of all the whining I've done here. I'm embarrassed that I've sought out people in my life for emotional support when I should have dealt with things privately, on my own. When I lost my mind to grief, I forgot everything that I knew. As the old adage goes: you come into this world alone, you live alone, you die alone. You solve your problems alone, needs to be added. The intense pain of grief can warp your mind, impair your judgment and make you do foolish things that you will later regret. I'm sorry if I've upset anyone, but my intention was simply an attempt at self-help, not to change the world. I was simply searching for a way to try to deal with and escape from this pain. I've always appreciated the supportive comments left by people and I thought I had expressed that before. I never thought anyone had an expectation that I would contact them or would even really want me to contact them. I am after all, a stranger to those who have read my words. I was getting to the point where I was starting to  consider emailing some of the people who have posted comments, just to thank them, but now I think that it's better that I don't. This is the old, public version of me writing to day.  I've pushed most of the real, troubled me back down into a box for a little while. I've resolved only to let her out when I'm alone.

0,"it's 3am and i can't sleep. i have got so many thoughts rushing through my head. i've tried writing them down and drawing pictures and doing mind numbing things to try and stop me thinking but it's not working. i just feel so angry for no particular reason. i feel really violent and have been having thoughts about hurting people. i'm not that kind of person. i haven't cut for nearly 2 months, and i just attacked my legs with a broken glass because i had to get it out of my system somehow. i don't know what's going on, i haven't been depressed lately i've been feeling pretty good really. i thought i was just getting things back under control and now whoosh i'm losing control again. i just want to stop thinking. i'm actually thinking about banging my head against the wall until my brain slows down.

1,"OK. I've been wanting to blog for awhile. Thing is I can't decide how honest I want to be in it. What if someone in the family found it? Guess I'll just have to take that chance. So anyway, what I really wanted to write about is Shana. I hate talking to anyone in the family about her because I don't want to upset them. I mean, what if they're having a good day? Then I pour out all of my stuff and make them start grieving again. Although I know, realistically, that we'll never stop grieving. I still cannot believe that she killed herself. Immediately after, that week, sometimes someone would say it must have been an accident. But come on, Shana was brilliant. She knew how little she was. Taking a bottle of anti-depressants and pain pills was not an accident. She wanted to leave. She wanted the pain to stop. That's why she took them at bedtime.  I still hear my brother describing how he found her. Right after we got to the house he told us everything. Took us up to Shana's room and showed us her bed. Showed us where he carried her to the top of stairs and tried CPR. Told us the police had to pry her out of his arms. Told us she was already getting stiff. And she was cold, he said, so cold. Sometimes I can't stop hearing the stuff from that week. I can hear him crying my name.  I remember so much from that week. Picking out the fingernail polish, helping Grandma iron her clothes. Previewing her hair and makeup with my sisters. We took a picture for reference. My sister was so tough. I couldn't see the details through the tears but J did.  Even writing in my journal I feel like I need to edit stuff out. But I can't. It's time to get this stuff out. Shana's been gone for over a year and I still don't really believe it. She was only 19 and had so much to live for. I'll never stop wondering why.  Her suicide note was in her live journal. Titled ""Enough is Enough"". That's it. I'm done. I love you all... The same message, or maybe a little longer, was set up as an 'away' message in outlook. I never could bring myself to email her so I'd get it back as a reply. I asked my sister if she'd made up an album of Shana stuff. She said she thought the pictures belonged interspersed with other family pictures. I don't know though. Seems like I might do an album - but do I put the funeral notice and program in there too? I wanted to keep them. Don't know why. ",3314642.200405120.female.42.txt

1,"It was a cold kind of day. The kind of cold kind of day that makes you chilly if you happen to be out side without warm clothes on. That is how cold it was. And, it just so happens that a character in this story happened to be out side on this cold day without any warm clothes on. In fact, he was not wearing any clothes at all. For that reason, and other reasons too, it was imperative that he find shelter immediately. Or soon there after. He had never experienced a day like this before. Ever before. Never in his lifetime before. He hopes to never experience anything like this again. but is what he hopes for really what is best for him? Only time will tell. This is the story of a man. Of a boy. Of a legend that no has heard of. Of a hero that no one knows. It will make you laugh. It will make you cry. You will read it from start to finish. You will not be able to put it down. You just wait. You will think you are just reading a book. You should know better. You will soon realize, the book is reading you.  He was running through the snow like a blind man. All he could see was white. Endless white. Everywhere he turned. Everywhere he fell. No matter where he looked. All there was, was white. The poor boy. He went flying as he tripped over a particularly bumpy patch of white. Over the cliff he went. Into the void. He fell for what seemed like only seconds, but really days passed as he fell. What could he do though, besides fall? Well really quite a lot, but how was he to know? If he had read the instructional manual before he took the plunge he would have known that in order to stop falling, all he had to do was simply to stop. ",3901881.200408130.female.15.txt
1,"Dear Friendship Troubles,     Give your friend the weekend to calm down, and you should too. Think of what you might have said wrong to her. On Monday, try and talk to her again. Don't talk to her and bother too much. If she tells you to leave her alone, leave her alone. But just say to her, I understand that you are mad at me, but I really think you should listen to what I have to say. Then, if she lets you, explian to her that you are sorry, and you don't like not talking to her. If she doesn't let you explain, resort to the next step. Write her a note. Write down everything you would say to her if you were talking face to face. Tell her to write back, or talk to you. It might just take one appology, but if it doesn't don't keep bothering her.

1,"Fourth of July: It was kinda boring for me. A few of Rachel's friends came over and we shot off some big fireworks that my daddy bought. It was alright I guess. Wow, okay now onto these last 2 days. I had to wake up at 5:30 in the morning on Monday to get ready to go to my Grandparents' house(which is in Branson--4 hours away). On the way we got McDonald's breakfast(because that's the only meal they can make that is good enough to choke down.) We got to their house at around noon. We came in and talked for a little bit, then we watched the tape of my promotion and from dance camp. Then we sat. And talked. And sat. And ate. And sat. Then my dad and grandpa went outside to unload firewood and they forced me to help them. Okay, I'm not the type of girl that goes out in the woods and loads firewood into a 30 year old Ford truck, but I did it just because I'd rather do that than sit inside and talk to my grandma, lol. When we were unloading it onto the stack of firewood that was already there, I got bit by an ant. It hurt like hell, so I went inside to put aloe vera on it. I checked my phone and saw that Kierston had called me, so I called her back. We ended up talking for the next half hour until my family came back inside and then we ate spaghetti for lunch. After lunch, Rachel and me went outside and rode the four-wheeler for a little while. Then I came back inside and called Cam and we talked until he had to go to baseball. We ate mac and cheese for dinner and then we watched TV for a little bit. Then I called Kier again cause I was bored and we talked for a little while. Then I came inside again and got ready for bed. I figured I should go to bed early since old people wake up early. The next day, my dad came in and woke me up at 9. I was soo mad. So I got up and ate breakfast, then went back to sleep till about noon or 1. My phone was dead, so I couldn't call anyone, unfortunately. We talked again for like an hour or whatever and then we left. On the way home we stopped by IHOP and I got some chocolate chip pancakes. And we got home late last night and I got on AOL, watched TV, the usual. Went to bed at like 3, woke up today at 12. Today Colton came over to see Rachel. They went swimming and she's taking him home right now. I'm sitting here bored out of my mind typing the longest thing I think I've ever typed in my life. Later... ",3866794.200407070.female.14.txt

0,"Well I'm getting ready to go back to school so I'm trying to get sober for a while and see i can clear my head. So far I've been sober for about days and i must say I'm not feeling any better. Some of the problem is probably zyrtec which I'm taking for my allergies but really i just feel really irritable and confused. i can't really think too well and it's making me want to drink. Drinking slows down my mind somewhat so i can focus on things in my head. Normally its not till the next day after a good night of drinking that i feel good for most of the next day. i am more talkative and can come up with things much easier. There are people who use Prozac and other anti-depressant drugs not because they want it but because it makes them feel even better than they normally do. This is somewhat my issue with alcohol however i don't fell good normally i feel like s**t normally. i guess i should let u in on what is really bothering me. First ill just list the problems i have i find most worrying. Night blindness ""fuzzy vision"" bad sinus pressure moderate fatigue all the time short term memory problems random aches and pains major depression, anxiety, and ocd bad allergies acid reflux. To be honest most scary one is night blindness. Trying to explain is pretty difficult but ill try. It's like being able to see all the cons and rods and your eye flash on and off constantly kind of like a bad channel on a TV screen. I've had it for years now with no one who can really give me straight answer about it. i went to my doctor recently and got up the nerve to tell him but thought he gave me some good info he probably thought i was mad. Anyway one of the first things your body will do when it's over exerted is give u fuzzy vision. Now normally night blindness is caused be a vitamin A deficiency. Maybe there is something wrong with my stomach that is making me feel the way i am and i did have kidney stone when i was 2 which is very rare. i know this is a lot of information but this is what i deal with on a ""daily"" basis. My daily routine is almost exactly the same except on weekends when i do go out and drink with my friends. my will is low and energy just as low so i find myself kind of in and out of this trance that is supposed to be life. Each day i go to work, come home, eat, and up to my room for pretty much the rest of the night. don't get me wrong i do other things during the week sometimes but i feel most comfortable by myself in my room as opposed to human contact which sucks. So if i have to drink to keep from going over the deep end then i will do so until i get some real answers. If anyone has any answers I'm all ears. ",r3dhorse_e_1_a_1_xx.txt

1,"Woohoo! My Very First Blog. I'm so happy. Now I'm gonna' spill my heart out like a naive little 3 year old! Or something like that.  So Today was the last actual day of school. I'm so happy, now we've got finals to do. What fun. I've got Japanese and Computer Literacy. We did nothing at school today whatsoever. It was really retarded, but it was fun, cause the teachers were somewhat intimidated and forked over tons of candy in a last ditch to maintain some semblance to order.  It worked.  During Science, M*rr*s (take that Google!) was a meanyhead, making me take the darn remote and fast forward through commercials, then count field trip money, then do this, and that, and so forth. Me no like M*rr*s. Oh well. SHE'S GONE FOREVER FROM MY LIFE AFTER THIS. I'm so freakin' happy.  History was kinda' stupid, but Micah and I chased each other around, and Ms. Yi got pissed. Japanese was kool, cause Austin and I got to sumo wrestle or something like it. Everyone was goofing off. It was awesome.  CS, I was locked in a room with Sm*th for a whole period. I was scared. He's still pissed at me, I think. Here's where background is required. He was dissing Mozilla (!), and how they were heralding ThunderBird as the next generation of email thing. Then he proceeds to diss all of Mozilla, including Composer and FireFox. Then, the final straw, he calls ThunderBird FireBird. So I tell him he's wrong and tell him that FireBird was the 1st generation of the  FireFox browser. He just kinda' stares at me. So I'm not sure whether he was really, really pissed or amazed that someone as computer illiterate as me would know that.  Skipping all other classes, I get to English with B*l*sta, 8th Period. I tried to behave in class, and this is the 4th day of the year that I managed to actually pay attention!!! But I got this pencil, and wrote on my binder, ""Blinder than a Mother-Freakin' Doorknob"" with an arrow pointing to my right.   Ms. B*l&sta walks over and has her back to me.

0,"Well I'm 13 so please excuse my grammar and spelling. Well it started almost about... 1.3 yr ago. I started to get large mood swings and would end up being sad or feeling guilty nearly everyday. That's when i discovered cutting myself. It started off as what does it feel like then grew into and addiction. I used to be doing it nearly everyday. IT made/makes me feel like there's nothing wrong. Well this grew bigger and bigger and i didn't tell anyone about it. After about 8 months i started to lie to myself and say everything was fine, It worked. Only temporarily. Around 3 months ago the feelings came back and i still have them at this moment. I have researched a lot about clinical depression. I still cut and i hate it. I came right out to my parents and said ''Maybe i enjoy cutting myself"" when we were in a huge fight. My dad turned around and said ""we don't care if you cut yourself"". This definitely didn't help. So right now i have one person i can talk to about it and has a good friend of mine. I checked the symptoms of clinical depression on Answers.com and i have 12/13 of them. I need to go see a doctor i know but i just can't. There's something stopping me and i don't know what it is.

Lately, I've been finding out that trying so hard  not  to love, hurts just as much.  With one look at me, you'd probably label me as a typical ""dumb"" blonde bimbo. Hopefully, if you really take the time to know me, you'll realize that, even though I do have my ditzy moments, I'm not at all like my exterior shows.  I'm a sexual person. If you don't like it, then don't say anything to me. I'm not at all slutty, but I'm in touch with my sexuality. I believe that as long as you're comfortable with your body and who you are, then that's a perfectly fine thing to be.  I'm probably one of the  most  open people you'll ever meet. So, looking at me, you might not think so, but I am. I've been through a lot, and you'll find all of it out eventually.  Anyways, I guess that's me in a nutshell.

1,"""Marriage, Marriage is what brings us together, today."" -- The Princess Bride      Women can be frustrating. My girlfriend and I just had a very important discussion two weeks ago about getting married. She then left to go on vacation for two weeks with her family. Since she leff, I keep thinking that she will say she doesn't love me and doesn't want to marry me. I've told her I love her and that I want to marry her but haven't yet proposed.      She is the type that likes to know all about what's going to happen before it happens. So she asked me all about the future and what I think about when we should get married and what will happen after that. I told her I want to marry her in December. She objects because she is a school teacher (like me)and that is a busy time of year. I'm okay with doing it another time (like June) but I love her so much and want to begin my life with her right now.      Anyway, I'm ultimately worried that she will get scared and run away.

0,"I seem to have depression the worst, first thing in the morning lately.  Just started with a new pdoc after 7 months. with another pdoc since this latest episode occured.  My old pdoc thought I could have a mild bipolar disorder but wasn't sure.  My 20 mg of prozac had stopped working after several years of keeping me stable.  She started me on lamictal and I am now up to 100 mg / day.  Stopped the prozac in early January and got worse, but not right away.  I was having a good week / bad week type pattern depending on where I was in my menstrual cycle while I was on the prozac.  I have battled depression on and off for 20 years.  Particularly bad postpartum and this recent episode.  I am 41 years old and haven't felt this bad since I had my daughter 8 years ago. My new doctor thinks I don't have an ounce of bipolar and that I am just in a depression (I tend to agree with her).  We decided together to add Lexapro to the mix and see if that helps me level out all the days of the month.  I have been on it almost 2 weeks patiently waiting for some results - I am well aware of the waiting game.  I am also taking Xanax XR in the evenings for sleep and to avert morning anxiety.  I take my Lamictal in the morning and a very small (half of the lowest dose of xanax) as well.  I seem to get moving and can be quite productive during my day after I take the Lamictal / xanax - don't know if this is a placebo effect?? My question is, has anyone experienced this a.m. depression that seems to lift a bit later in the day?  Also, does anyone take Lamictal for unipolar depression?

1,"I've been having trouble sleeping.  Well, not really.  I can sleep allright but I have these Godawful dreams that wake me up.  They aren't even the scary kind that are at least interesting to think about the next day. Like ""What the hell did I eat last night that made me dream about long legged owls wearing blue jeans chasing me through my 1st grade classroom while screaming shutup"" No, I've been dreaming about work.  Usually, I have a row of figures from one construction bid and I'm trying to compare them to a 2nd bid.  How freaking boring is that!  But it creates a really restless sleep.  Then at 4AM, I am wide awake.  I feel so AWAKE!  More awake then I've ever felt in my entire life.  I could read a book on the ""Philosophy of Physics"" and still be wide awake.  I know because I tried.  Then at about 5am I drift off to sleep only to be awakened 2 hours later by the alarm.  I awaken feeling so groggy, almost hung over like.

1,"In the past few days my life has changed so much. First i stayed at my friend Pauls house and by the time i left i had a GF. The story goes: I had been begging her to go out with me, she finally agreed to go out with me. I was so happy, and as it turns out i was her first kiss. It was great. She is the greatest thing to happen to me in a while. She is beautiful and i don't think she believes it. But she is. She has surprised me so much since i have known her. When i first met her my thought was ""Man she is beautiful"" I also thought ""I am going to get her if its the last thing i do"". I knew i had to have her. And now we are going out and her mom doesn't know! Not that we think she would get mad though i am sure she would, but we want to give it time. I want to be able to stay there a few times before i am not allowed to. I am sure that it might backfire at us but its a danger i am willing to conquer when it comes. Well its been 4 days since i asked her out, and i think it is going great. I got to spend time with her while i was there, and we had quite a bit of fun. But that is our business. She really did surprise me. She really is a great kisser, she can always get me going. I haven't told her that, but everytime she kisses me, i get a hard on. I guess she will know now!

0,"Hello All, I'm a 27 year old female from PA. I've been dealing with severe depression since my early 20's. I recently had two friends tell me that they think I may be bipolar. Hmm� I'll have to disagree. I don't really have ""highs."" At least not anymore. Mostly just feel like blah. Sometimes it's so bad I think things would be better if I wasn't around. I would never commit suicide, but it doesn't stop the thoughts from clouding my head. I've had the therapy and been on medicines... celexa, paxil, combo of celexa and lamictal, lexapro, wellbutrin. NOTHING. I'm not taking anything right now, but am in the process of looking for a new therapist as my insurance recently changed. This sucks. Most of the time I feel nothing. Empty.

1,"Last night Jerry Douglas came to town and played a free concert. That guy is SO GOOD. He made me want to learn to play the dobro. And the best part was that his fiddle player had a mohawk. It was kind of like the whole band was saying, ""Even though we play bluegrass instruments, we're WAY beyond bluegrass."" They even had the same bass player as Nickel Creek. I wonder if that guy goes around joining bluegrass bands and then turning them into non-bluegrass bands. Or maybe in this case it was Jerry's idea. Maybe he got too sick of bluegrass from playing with Alison Krauss. Well it was a really great concert, nonetheless. ",4065478.200407281.female.25.txt

I'm tired of needing to TALK to someone and having them throw everything back at me because they are too much of a coward to face their own problems. I'm tired of being alone and I'm tired of not trusting anyone and I'm tired of everything I'm tired of being caused by something else I'm tired of. I'm tired of crying myself to sleep every night. I'm tired of having to take drugs to try to feel better and having them not work. I'm tired of pretending on the outside that I'm some happy go-lucky person who spends 99% of the day choking back tears because I feel like the most insignificant person on earth. I'm tired of dolling out advice to people in my life who are sad and having them all of a sudden just feel better when I have spent my whole life just looking for one true moment of happiness - not one caused by drugs or alcohol or anything else, but just real true happiness. I'm tired of having to pretend like I'm ok, because I'm NOT ok. I'm NOT. This is NOT ok. It is NOT ok that someone has to feel like this. It is NOT ok that someone has to be this sad and lonely and that the most important thing I can do in any given day is just make it through. This is not life. This is supposed to get easier, better, at some point - doesn't it HAVE to get better? Because I am starting to realize it doesn't. I'm starting to realize that some people get to be happy and others have to take the crap that no one else wants. I'm tired of being pushed around and then being called a wuss and I'm tired of standing up for myself and being called a Bitch for it. I'm tired of being the butt of everyone's jokes ""oh, it's all Blugh's fault ha-ha-ha"". I'm tired of all of it.

I've been trying that for 29 years now, and it's NOT WORKING. It is not ok that I felt this much pain when I was a little girl with no real reason to feel this much pain and that it hasn't gotten better. What the hell does a person have to do to deserve that little iota of happiness that everyone else seems to have in abundance??!? I'm tired of ALL of it. Every last little tiny thing. This forum isn't going to help, it just makes me more angry cause I bet everyone who reads it is thinking and feeling the same thing and none of us know what the hell to do to be happy for just one god d*** minute, all we do is sit here and try to help each other make it to the next morning. IT'S NOT FAIR. I don't care if ""life isn't fair""...at some point, I deserve it. I don't care if that sounds selfish, I don't care of it sounds mean spirited or immature or anything. All I want is to wake up tomorrow and not count the minutes through the work day until I can be alone again just so I can sit around feeling lonely because I'm too scared to let anyone in my life because every time I do, they just make it worse with lies, cheating and pain. I just want to ONE day have someone tell me they love me and mean it. JUST ONCE. I just want to actually have the ability to REALLY trust someone. Just ONCE. WHY is it so hard? It's not like I'm asking for the world. I don't even want it forever. I just want it once. I just want one moment of happiness. REAL happiness.

1,"A Long Story So here’s the situation I was and still sort of am in a group of four friends (friends for about 3 years). One of our four was a new girl who we added to the group about half of a year ago. But a few weeks ago three of us pranked the new girl’s best friend, it did not go well and suddenly the NG stopped hanging out with our group (we hangout but mostly play games online). But what I wouldn’t learn till the following week was that she wasn’t hanging out with me and rest of the group was hanging out her behind my back. They lied about having things to do, or saying the were simply to busy to spend time together. When we did hangout the other two and I they both acted odd and withdrawn, I attempted to dig into why and even asked if it specifically related to NG but I got backlash for doing so so I let up. However later I learned about her not wanting/being to hangout with me was a “intervention” where the three of them sat me down and told me that NG’s BF old her that She couldn’t be friends with me anymore because her BF told her that it was all my fault and she had to choose between me and her BF in addition I learned that why my friends had been harsh and avoided me earlier in the week, they had lied to me about the whole situation. They knew about the ultimatum that NG’s BF gave her the whole week and decided not to tell me till now, they claim it was to save my feelings but it didn’t come off that way. The “Intervention” ended with her leaving and me leaving as well. The next couple of weeks are bad not only is our group divided, I am the odd man out they spend the bulk of their time with NG and ignore me for the most part. So I confront my two friends (one I’ve been friends with for five years and the other three), I tell them it’s unfair that I am getting the short end of this situation when she made the decision to break up the group, I also tell them that the fact that they were willing to lie and go behind my back is wrong and that they justify it by claiming that NG is the victim because she lost a friend (so did I). They have apologized for the lying and going behind my back but I told them that I don’t feel comfortable with them spending time with her and being friends with all the problems she caused me and their easy willingness to lie for her to me. They tell that they will always be friends with her and that I can’t ask them to cut her off because it would divide the group, even though she already divided the group by pushing me out and they did nothing about it as a matter of fact the backed her up and supported her decision. So I told them that I have too walk away from the group then because I don’t feel valued, respected, or able to trust them after what they have done. Am I in the wrong? What should I do should I walk away? I don’t want to throw away my two closest friends but I feel like they don’t even care about me anymore. I apologize for the long post. ",DAran67.txt

0,"My Fictional Home I stared outside, and watched the cold atmosphere awake me. The sun’s rays blocked by the magnificent beauty above us all; an urban scape filling my view around me. I felt a grave sadness strike all in the same spots for my daily routine, crippling what was left of my head. I grabbed the bicycle, and went along the path to any good in my life. ‘A nearly missed accident up ahead,’ I reminded myself. I hit the button to change colors, and awaited a stop that could mean a sour tardiness or a decent morning. The color changed fast, and I hastily sped across the lines between me and the other side. I arrived, striking the pavement at full speed ahead down the rubber sidewalk. A straight path to follow, a new future to envelop soon enough. The fact of the matter was that I had to pray to a god I didn’t believe in if I wanted to warp my happy spirit to glorious utopia. Logic overrides hearts quite rarely, leaving a snowflake and a shock of noise behind the mind that just wants it all to change. My bored mind only somewhat consciously bobbed his head around from side to side, keeping an eye on the reflective sign for a change of heart. The observant man coming by on a bicycle or on his own two legs could notice the hurting expression that shone on my face. An insomnia that has outlasted its course, half a heart to spare to the one it belongs to, and the tonnes lying on his stubby shoulders. Whether the man is out to care for their dog, the mail, something; they always take a look to glance at the face of a broken child, often not realizing the fine details in the street lights glowing on my frozen cheeks. ‘What did it take to find redemption?’ I often wondered, as grand sunlight was walking upstairs to knock the moon off it’s sleepy stool. I sat and watched a beautiful red giant approach, and drew images in mind to flicker about and echo in my concave dome of secrets. As the flickering opportunity ran full speed in front of me, I turned and felt the imagery toss into the incinerator. A great insecurity washed over the industry working ahead up above, slowing me down as I walked in slowly toward the place to call work. I sat the bicycle at it’s rack, hands in pocket as I blinked at the glaring sun. A numbness hit my heart, and for the next eight hours, I’d lose who I was, only coming back at the rise of a pounding rain. I walked from a distant building, taking the long path to a home that didn’t know me. I took the rugged bicycle, and stared up above at the shadowy clouds. I leaned forward over the handlebars, watching the patterns fly past my visions. I lifted up again, opening my voice to play a tune, looking for a face to redeem my little work. I went onward, and stared at the home that forgot me. I walked slowly up, placing the bicycle just where it was, hitting the kickstand which had sacrificed my ankle some. I opened the door, giving a brief greeting. I entered the meeting room of regrets and lost innocence, stroking my hands over what was a cuddly friend. My vision blurred, feeling the great exhaustion from the night prior taking me over. I curled in the corner, feeling the toilets flushing the pent up pains from an earlier disembarkment of a peanut gallery. I hugged the one thing that brought a soothing to my life, and proceeded to let out an ugly sob, trying to remember who everyone was, as I grabbed a broken mirror, staring at who the blurry stranger was in it. I felt myself faint, awaking to two strangers cycling the door between storage and the hands of all waiting for me. “What were you thinking?” the woman asked, “What did you say?” the man asking. “I don’t know.” I responded, lying on my side, as they both awkwardly stepped out, with a cracked expression of what was me walking out. I felt a blankness ride across my body, as I stared upon a wall that reminded me of life. I sat stationary, and buried my head under a recording of a person with nothing left. I held my heart, staring out at the dark that I wanted to escape in. A length that no person dared, but a low that felt necessary. I felt an unnecessary realism flow through me, as my arms folded, feeling a coldness drip down my neck. I got up, and went to the porch of attempting life again. A moon vanished above me, showing a pine away from me only just by some measurements. The bicycle appeared broken on the road, as I walked to what I remember being the last resort in this world. I walked to a reused bench, and stared out at the murky waters that felt like memories. I looked to my left, seeing a young boy sitting in the back of a delinquent’s wagon, and to my right a child amongst a smaller group, enjoying the finer delicacies of life. In between it all, a fool. I cracked my bubbly back, as a soreness hit my veins. I stood slowly, my body tossing and turning inside. The world turned askew, as the sun beat slowly onto my flustered body. I took flight across the ramp of a broken dream, taking a flip that would ruin me for a day. A nostalgia for the life that was simple broke me down slowly, as I felt my walking slow down. I sat by a curb, watching a teenager go away from a regretful sunset on a bench. He sported a terrible frown, forgetting of the one. A light flew by at fast speeds, turning away from my stretched out legs, as a noise emitted from it’s front. I stared blankly into the street, feeling my mind shatter into many jagged pieces. A dam blocked the feeling of humanity and a progress of going up in the world. I picked up the pieces, attaching them to my hurting consciousness. I stomped back to a filthy bed, staring into the bright light that fueled no purpose. I spread a message, the bait missing all parties. I collapsed, waking to a time of no reply. I logged into what made time fly by, and felt the pains of months wash away within seconds. A second half had joined, and I forgot about all the things around me for the next year. Dawn upon myself shined my sleepy public works to let out a shrieking cry, standing over a bin full of scraps and desperation to fix my bleeding innards. I panicked into a corner, awaiting life’s worst terrors. I stood to nothing, and returned to a hamper of depression. I stared at the dusty fan blades fly full speed, breathing in only to glance at the horrid truth. A shadow stood behind my forgotten figure, taunting the fullness above it. I wore a jacket and yelled at it, and it shyly walked. I took a deep breath and walked outside toward the bench once again, staring out at the beautiful waters. A creature came from the waters, approaching me. I held its hand, standing up accordingly. The creature pushed me into a pit full of spikes, as I awoke to half of me missing. I felt a burning inside of me, as my insides waned into a fine drawing of genitalia, washing the deliberate feeling and thought around my head, causing me to let out of a horrific screech of losing a natural ability. My body awoke in a new person’s home, as I stared out into the busy road below my sleepy figure. An old woman came out from the corner, as I nervously responded with a gulp. We shared an exchange, as I sat and pondered the shelves of a life that I knew little about. I explored the past, only finding multiple recordings of enthusiasts. I folded my hands, recognizing that I meant nothing here. The plane flew slowly away, as the shock went away from my skull, as my heart was left with a small hole. I sat and could not breathe, only feeling a great pain as we jumped into the chair of obnoxious actions. I sat and thought, glancing at the broken mirror. It was me. ",who_i_was.txt

I never enjoyed when I with you. Is that because of the chemistry?? I think yes because no matter what I say, what I do it’s wrong in your eyes. Am I really that clumsy?? I wonder do I really look like that?? Why I can’t overcome myself. It’s that fear that I scared. Can I let go my fear?? Oh God, I never asked you anything. I just want to be loved. Is that wrong?? Am I asking too much??  Oh please someone tell me what am I supposed to do. I am also a human too. I need love and loved someone. Do I have any options left behind??

Tell you I have my pride and I won’t let you pity on me. No matter what, I will survive. I am not asking you to come back I just wonder.. Have I done something wrong??

I thought what the most important is just do whatever you think is right. I don’t care what people say about me. Let them say anything they like. Makes them happy. Or are they jealous with me??

1,"My mother and her tragically unlucky family Hey, guys, I thought this was worth posting because I'm still totally gobsmacked at how unlucky and dysfunctional my mother's side of the family was, and it interests me because it sounds like a curse, when it was likely all just chance. My mother was born in the late 50's, and it was my grandparents' third child, although she eventually had six siblings in the end (only two brothers are still alive). The way my auntie and uncles died, and how one turned out, creeps me out. So here we go; So my mother used to have younger twin siblings - one boy and one girl - and my mother when she was four got into a serious car accident (grandfather was driving) so this would be 1962. She and my grandfather survived but her twin siblings didn't survive and both were tragically killed at the age of two. But it gets unluckier. So, a few years go by, my mother has two new little brothers at the time (let's call them George, born in 1963, and Alan, born a couple of years later) 1975, and again a tragic loss. My grandparents and family go through the loss of George, who, if you do the simple math, was only twelve when he died in a boat accident during a school trip. Apparently he jumped in the water to impress his friends while kayaking, and a boat later came speeding, didn't see him, and the front of it struck George's head. He drowned while unconscious because the teacher wasn't present (and apparently, he got in alot of shit for that). But again, it gets unluckier. Four years later, 1979, my grandfather, who was one of the bosses of a distribution warehouse, got into an accident during work. Wasn't told how, but it was fatal. So during the late 70's leading up to my grandfather's death, my mother's two older brothers (let's name them Johnny and Frank, both in their twenties) end up doing drugs, although my uncle Frank apparently handled his habit better than Johnny. Uncle Johnny eventually moved onto injecting heroin, was stealing off family and friends until he got kicked out of my grandma's. He eventually disappeared from the family. So 1983, after a couple years from last hearing of Johnny, my mother and her family receive news that a body found overdosed in a park four months prior, belonged to Johnny. Died at twenty-seven and wasn't identified for months by forensics. He was homeless and had nothing in possession to identify who he was. So my grandma, who is now nearing ninety, is still going strong. Mentally and physically great besides just a walking stick. She lost four children at the ages of two, twelve, and twenty-seven. And a husband. I never met any of them because this, of course, all happened before I was born. The ones who are still here is Alan, Frank, and my mother. My uncle Alan turned out to be okay. Frank, on the other hand, now in his sixties, is an abusive alcoholic who lives in a crummy apartment with whoknows and has two kids he never sees. He turned down rehab many times but my grandma once told me that he drinks because he blames himself for what happened to Johnny, since he was the one who introduced him to drugs. But he hates us and wants nothing to do with the rest of his family anymore. I've only seen him four times in my life, and he was abusive on two occasions. One time when we went for a family meal when I was six, he ruined the night by abusing the resterant staff. So my mother and uncle Alan are the only people out of seven kids who turned out to have positive lives. Depressing as fuck, isn't it? ",Gherico70.txt

The moment I got up today I knew I was going to have a good day, cuz I woke up briskly and eager to go to Saturday School. But now that I think about it...today was a REALLY tiring day. The most tiring day I've ever had at Saturday School maybe. I mean HAL!! Hal is SO GODDAMN loquacious! (Hahah, there goes my vocab again...) He would NOT shut up!! We did show and tell again and he would make either a sarcastic remark or a ""Oh I have that"" to everything everyone says. YOU SMARTASS!! And then for HIS show and tell, guess what he gets out... fossils and anmonites.  He even made this presentation-board type of thing. And he talks back to me, says mean things that he doesn't mean, etc...that kid absolutely drives me  mad.  But what the hell, at least he's somewhat entertaining...half the laughter in that class is caused by Hal's smartness (and stupidness...today he said 'Stupidity counts in everything.' Daresama yanen...lol) . Talked to Victor today, was nice...he's so cute, hehe. It's so weird how my heart jumps whenever I see him.

0,"I take it that by you saying ""Learn to give rather than take and you will find life turns around!"" that you're implying that I'm a taker and not a giver. And maybe that's so. Maybe all the blood that I've donated (it gives me a sense of purpose and sometimes it seems that the nurses there are the only ones who care that I'm alive, and that's only because of what my body produces) or the times when I do things out of the kindness of my heart rather than for monetary gains or as a means to earn someone's favor or to make them somehow indebted to me like others would do, maybe doing all that still means that I'm a taker. I don't know. I've been told that my perceptions can't really be trusted, but that doesn't sound like someone who's a taker to me. I'm 27. And by that age most guys have been in at least one relationship. I haven't. That's why I've set the timeframe. Everyone I know has had at least a taste of love and human companionship by the time they were 30. So I've decided that if no one wants me, why stay? Living alone means seeing what I want on TV....and having absolutely no one to enjoy or discuss it with. That's my view of it. Pessimistic? Yes, but it's been the truth for me.

It feels like so much time has gone by that any attempt at reconciliation would do more harm than anything else at this point. We used to have so much fun, but nostalgia only makes everyone feel worse, and more often than not leads to poor choices. It’s a sweet substance, like sugar, just with a punch in the gut to remind you that you can’t ever go back to something you once valued so highly. It’s been a year and a couple months since we’ve talked, and there’s rarely a day where you don’t cross my mind. I’m not saying that’s healthy, because it sure as hell isn’t, but who cares anyways. I wasn’t good for you, you were too good for me, we crashed and burned and I loved every second of it. Was it worth it? Maybe. Does that matter? Not in the slightest. Now I just sit alone in the dark writing you letters that I know you’ll never fuckin’ read, pretending in my head that there’s some fucking way that i can salvage the situation. It’s like watching someone stand at the bottom of the pool drowning, when all they have to do is swim to the surface. I’m cold, and tired, wasting time and throwing away opportunities left and right because i have no idea what I’m doing, and I know that you’re doing well, that makes me happy. You deserve to succeed. You’ve been to hell and back, and I might as well have been the chauffeur for a good portion of it. I loved you, I don’t think I do anymore, but I know I did. I thought about comparing how I felt about you with a bunch of shitty metaphors but let’s be honest, that isn’t our style. We’d probably laugh at how cheesy it was and how stupid this whole situation is and then we’d pull out our guitars and write a beautiful sad duet and I’d be out of tune while you hit every note perfectly. But you wouldn’t critique me, that’s just the way you are. Too kind, and sweet, too good to everyone you came across even though you knew there was a pretty good chance that they’d never return the favor. And man I really tried to, all those times we walked around talking about how much we wanted to die and how sad we were, but the whole thing was build on the back of our own loneliness and sadness. But that’s the past. Nostalgia is bullshit, but I have to indulge once in awhile just to feel something, I’m sure you remember that. Here’s to better times ahead, and a letter left unread.

I was very skeptical of ever hearing from him again.  I still do not know what happened over graduation weekend to cause the complete lack of communication between us recently.  I guess at some level I knew that we would never be able to work things out with 800 miles between us.  I was dreaming for a little bit.  I do believe things happen for a reason, however.  I just wish I could figure out the reason for having met James at this time in my life.  It's almost scary how perfect he is for me.  We have the same stupid sense of humor and understand each other perfectly.  I can't imagine him ever being an asshole or us ever staying mad at each other.

0,"I had therapy today. I don't even know where to start. First off, I lost a day last week (time loss/dissociation)...it was last Tuesday that I lost. My mom called me Friday and I said ""why are you calling me"" and she said ""I always call you on Friday"". I told her that it was Thursday and she told me I was wrong. So, I back tracked the best I could and I can't remember anything that I did on Tuesday. The interesting thing is that I mailed my therapist the research info I found on dissociation so when I saw her today I asked her what was the date that I put on the letter I sent and guess what...IT WAS TUESDAY. Then she asked me if I brought it in and I told her no that I mailed it. And she said that I couldn't have because it wasn't scanned by the post office. She showed me the envelope and it wasn't scanned at all. She also said that the mail had already come in the office and the envelope was in her mailbox way after she had already checked her mail. So, we have no idea how that got to her office. But I don't drive and Carol didn't take me anywhere last week. So, if anyone remembers being with me or talking to me Tuesday...COULD YOU HELP ME OUT PLEASE. My therapist looked over the information that I sent her and she said that everything basically fits with what I'm going through and DID. The problem is, she doesn't treat dissociative disorders and has no idea how to even help me. I appreciated her honesty though. But she said she knows a therapist in Jeffersonville, IN...oh God...that treats dissociative patients but I don't drive and Carol's not going to take me over to Jville on a weekly basis for therapy. Also, we've never even been over there before so we'd get lost. So, she then called her boss and another lady to see if they knew who else in Louisville could help me and to see if she can get some help on treating me. I also gave her more info on some of the things I'm dealing with and the voices that are going on. I even gave her the names of the two that I already know of. She said the fact that I can't remember my childhood and that I not only lose time for minutes but also for days that it isn't normal and we need to figure out how to help me. I've been in the mental health system since 2001 and have had just about every diagnosis slapped on me. I hope I can finally get some help. I'm honestly about to give up. She also said that she's going to see if they can take me off the Seroquel since it's making me sick and NOT WORKING. So, she asked me what else I've been on and I told her (Haldol - didn't work, Risperdal - didn't work, Zyprexa - didn't work, Paxil/Paxil CR - worked for a little bit then wore off, Wellbutrin - didn't work). She said that she wants to try Depakote, Abilify, or another mood stabilizer. I also took those two journal entries in that I posted last week so she could read them. And, I wish I could get it scanned but it didn't look right to me so I can't show them to you (that's why I just typed it) and she said that one of the interesting things that stood out about the entries is that the handwriting was different in three places. I'm a mess. But believe it or not, after today's session I am a little hopeful. In other news, Carol and I have started working on our book of poetry. We've been throwing around ideas all day and working out some details. We're in the process of getting the poems we want to be in the book together and coming up with a title (which we have already done). We're also working on the different categories that we want the poems to fall under. I've been working around with PagePlus for a couple of hours now trying to figure out how we can set this up.

0,"Hey, I guess this is the place to post this. I don't really know if I'm depressed and if I am I'm not sure how to go about getting help for it so I figured you guys would be able to help me out a bit. For the past year and a bit I've been feeling really out of sorts, pretty down and kind of lost in general. I left school in July 2004 and started a year out before I went to university. That's when I started feeling strange and I put it down to (and still believe it was) just a weird kind of feeling when one leaves school and their life changes forever and it's the beginning of being an adult which is a scary time for anyone. Over the year I'd go through different stages where for a few months I'd feel really positive and enjoy spending time with people and then for a few months I'd feel lonely and sad and not go out with friends for months on end. Then I went to university in September 2005 and felt very very sad. I think it was the shock of leaving home, living away from everyone I'd ever known and also the feeling of being back at school. I knew immediately that I'd made a terrible decision starting university, it wasn't what I wanted to be doing with my life and for the 6 weeks I was there I would stay in bed pretty much all day and not eat much. I think I lost about a stone and a half and even now, 3 months after dropping out and moving back home I'm still half a stone lighter than I was last summer. So now I'm back at home and I've started a job cleaning tables in a cafe where I got on with the people I work with and I'm back in the same city as my girlfriend again and things should be ok but I keep dropping into really low moods.  A few weeks ago I thought that maybe it was depression and so I took some tests on the internet with what seem to be the basic questions. I tried to answer as truthfully as possible, you have to understand that depression is not something I want to have, I've known too many silly teenagers who think that having depression makes them interesting to other people and so they exaggerate emotions to try and look sad to find it appealing. So even though I found myself answering questions that I knew were making me seem depressed I answered the anyway because it was the truth. Things like a lowered libido, I find myself wanting to have sex with my girlfriend far far less frequently than I used to and to be honest a lot of the time when I'm having sex I feel that I'm just going through the motions. My sleeping which has always been a little odd has become increasingly erratic and I've found myself thinking about death a lot. To be honest though I thought that everyone thought about death and dying and that it was natural. I fin myself becoming very easily bored with people and situations and where I once used to enjoy writing stories I can't being myself to do it anymore. The worst thing though is the mood swings I have and the low moods I find myself in quite frequently. When I feel like this I don't want to be around anyone or have anyone talk to me and I can't stop myself thinking about bad things that have happened to me or could happen on a personal level and making myself the centre of blame for them. So am I depressed or is it just, as I'm leaning towards, a natural part of growing up and finding myself in the world of work and adulthood and trying to adjust to it. And if I am depressed how do I stop myself being this way? The thought of going to my doctor and sitting there and saying ""I think I'm depressed"" doesn't make much sense to me. I've always thought that with problems of that nature you must be told that you're ill and not decide for yourself that you are. Sorry if this has been very long and poorly punctuated, I wrote it all fairly stream of consciously. Any help at all would be very much appreciated, I'm feeling pretty vulnerable and down right now and don't want to feel this way anymore. ",chalieburd_e_1_a_1_xx.txt
1,"My mom showed heavy favoritism to sister, and i deeply resent both of them. So, i'm 20. I’m a pretty happy, go lucky person, but whenever i think back to my childhood i instantly get depressed and cannot function. This has been haunting me for years, and i'd love to get it out in the open. But, i would like it if someone could read this and tell me, if i have legit reason to be upset about this, or if i'm overreacting? So, in my first 6 years, i was a normal, happy kid. I had a warm, happy family. My parents were just normal, i was a little spoiled, but when your the first born, that's kind of a given, right? But that all changed when i was 5, my mom announced she was pregnant. with another baby. At first, i was happy, i knew what was happening, since i saw it on tv before. Mom still had time for me, of course that all changed when i was 6. I was in 1st grade when she was born. Until she was born, my parents spent literally all their time with me. Here is when the bs started. . So, to start was her actual birth itself. It was a saturday, mom went into labor. I was in my bedroom, playing a video game. Then, during the middle of my game, i heard tires squealing, i looked out my window and saw the family car speeding off. They forgot me, i at first thought they were rushing to the corner store, since mom had some bizarre cravings, mostly for their pizza. But hours went by, i started to worry, and after almost 6 HOURS, someone came to the house to get me (my grandmother). I was kind of peeved, but my dad promised to get me ice cream, so all was settled. So, next was the sleeping arrangement. Every night, i slept right between my parents. I never slept alone, they tried to ween me, but i wasn't particularly fond of my bed. I liked sleeping with them, because it was warm, and i've always had this ""thing"", where i have to run my fingers through someone's hair before sleeping, i kind of grew out of it, forcefully. How? Well, i never got to share a bed with mom again, me and my dad were regulated to the guest room. Mostly because i didn't sleep alone (i never started until i was about 12). Every night after that, my mom took my sister into my spot, she said she'd come get me to come in her bed after my sister fell asleep, but guess what? She never did. Not once did i sleep with mom ever again. We later moved in with my grandma, who only had 2 rooms. I slept with mom and sis every night, and she always pryed and forced herself between me and mom. Come to think of it, mom never really had time for me any more, i had to start taking the bus to school. since she had no babysitter, plus dad worked. I kind of always prefered mom, to my dad. She was a lot more fun, and creative. She made me a marble box out of popsicle sticks once. But, she kind of pawned me off on my dad after the devil child was born. Sadly, when i was 7, my parents divorced and me, my sister, and my mom lived with my grandma. Now, when i was 9, i had gotten involved in 4-h. I had a talent for writing and giving speeches. So, it was a big deal for me. I was the best in my class, and even made it to county competition. One of only 5 kids in my school. It was my proudest moment, since i always sucked at sports. So, we got to the place, there were 50 people listening to me give my speech, i had my little suit, and was very proud of myself. I practiced hours a day, i wanted to go to state as well. And as soon as i get to the podium, guess who starts crying. Loud enough that everyone can hear it. My sister. So, mom had to take her out. She never saw my speech. I gave it, but i just couldn't do it right, i was on the verge of crying myself from what happened. I was too upset that she was missing it, i got a ""Participant"" ribbon, my big moment was ruined. I was gonna do it again next year, but when i wrote my speech, i had no enthusiasm for the project, and it lacked the ""zing"" the previous one had, so i didn't advance very far. I honestly didn't care anymore, mom asked about it, I told her my sister would probably ruin it. She started growing up, and became an even more entitled little tyrant. Here we start on her as a tween. She just got so much worse. First of all, mom really only paid attention to her. She never came in my room to come visit, at all. That's a general example, here is a more specific list. First of all, there was one time that my pants had a hole, the pocket ripped and my wallet fell out, and I never noticed until the next day. She found it, and instead of returning it, she took $100 out of it, then returned it the next day. Worst of all, she told mom to promise not to tell me that she took it, she bought a cell phone with it. I didn't even find out until almost 10 years later. Anytime I would try to spend time with mom, she'd always come in. I never got alone time with my mom, without her rearing her head. That was if I even got to spend time with her at all. She'd promise to spend time with me, but I’d either wait forever, and I’d be too tired to do anything. Or, she'd never show up at all. One time, it was about 8, I asked if she wanted to play Tetris. She said she'd love to, in a few minutes. So, I loaded up Tetris, paused it and waited. Keep in mind, I couldn't really do anything else. It was nearly 2 and a half hours. She never showed, so I went to bed, I could hardly hold my eyes open. She finally did show, she got mad and said ""I thought you wanted to play?"" But, I told her ""I couldn't wait forever."" Her excuse was that she had to wait for my sister to go to bed, because I’d get mad if she came to play too. Instead of saying ""No, I want some quality time with my son"", she just waited till absurd hours of the night, knowing I’d be too tired to play. That was how it was any time I wanted to play with mom. Minor story, I got a bop it toy for Christmas. She asked to borrow it and take it to school, she had to write her name on it so if it got lost, the school would know who it belonged too. She never gave it back, and about 2 weeks, her and mom were playing with it, I asked if I could have it back, and she said it was hers. I never saw it again. One time, she broke my tv. She got the day off from school, faking being sick (I’ll get to that in a moment). While at school, she lounged around my room all day, and somehow broke my tv. I have no clue how, but it's just when I got home it was broken. She never got yelled at or punished whatsoever. The time I got the flu. All night I had been chilled, shivering, and sick. I felt awful, I told my grandma, and she let me take the day off and would take to the doctor's office that day. That morning, I got yelled at, accused for playing hooky. I got took to the doctor, and guess what? I was diagnosed with the flu. Mom changed her tone, and acted nice and as if she was worried the whole time. I got guilted for needing to miss a week. Then the next day, guess who got the flu? My sister. So, she got tested. Guess what, no flu. She acted sick all morning, but as soon as mom told her she could miss school, 2 hours later, she was riding her bike and doing cart wheels in the yard. No yelling, no punishment One time she threw my 80's, rare wrestling figures into a muddy ditch, ruining the paint job. Nothing. There was one birthday, she got $100, my birthday came, only 75. You know, around this time I started to watch lots of anime. I pretended I was in their worlds, it always brought me happiness. I tried to get my mom interested, but she never did. Then, one weekend, I asked her to play Mario with me, like the good old days. But, my sister showed up, with a Dragon Ball Z DVD, battle of gods movie. She asked if I wanted to watch it, I said no because I’ve seen that movie 10 times already. Mom got mad at me, and watched it with her. For 5 years I’ve been begging her to watch it with me, but she never could. I sat and watched it with them, because she said if I did, she'd play with me. She sat through the whole movie with her. So, after waiting over an hour for her to play with me. She finally showed, played one level, and went to bed because she was too tired. We'd play in the morning she said, that morning never came. Then, my graduation. Around this time, she moved in with our dad. They all came to my graduation, but she mostly talked to her the whole time, begging her to come visit. Also, funnily enough, I never got told congratulations or anything for graduation. She never posted how proud she was of me on Facebook, or anything. But, that same year, my sister made the honor roll. I never heard the end of it. So, recently, last year I got an injury. and that brought on a whole slew of crap. Most of these involve me wanting privacy for my problems and her showing up when not wanted. First, was physical therapy. She just had to come, without even asking me, mom said yes. I told her no, I didn't want her to go. We had a huge fight, and we didn't go. Then, was a checkup. I didn't want her to come, but she did anyway. There was no reason for her to go, they just sat in the lobby. This was a very personal thing, and I wanted as few people there as possible. I remember mom wheeled me in, (I was in a wheelchair), and sis said she'd wait in our car. Nope, guess who walked in. Mom largely ignored me at my own appointment. Therapy and Doctor's appointments were the only time we really got together. Then, another time I asked her to play a game with me. She actually did, then in 5 minutes, guess who called out. My sister, mom just disappeared, and never came back, so I just turned it off. And finally, the most recent example. I actually planned on moving out. I needed a 10-dollar box. I begged and asked for weeks, and it took seemingly forever to buy me that box, but my sister asked for a 300-dollar dress, and she got it bought for her in less than a day. ",hammerfan12.txt

0,"Hello again everyone, my real name is Mike. I found this site a couple weeks ago but have been pretty busy with the holidays and a new job. So I thought I would post a bit more about myself. This isn't easy since I am not that good at talking about myself but here goes. I am 35 years old and have been depressed as long as I can remember. When I was 12 or 13 years old I remember sitting in my closet in my room with the doors shut writing a suicide note. After talking to a friend of mine about 7 years ago who started going to a therapist and taking Prozac, I decided to go get help. I didn't even know to call it depression until I started talking to him. I was diagnosed with Dysthymic Disorder and have been on and off a couple different kinds of medicines, one of which was Effexor and the other one I can't remember the name but it started with and S. I have a bad habit of remembering every bad thing that has ever happened to me and continually go over and over it in my head. I will bring up something with my brother or sister and they say ""I can't believe you remember that"" and yet sometimes I am lucky I remember my own name. I just started a new job recently and will not have insurance until the end of January. I am seriously considering going back to a therapist and possibly getting on medicines again. I am tired of carrying around this baggage and want to do something about it. There are so many things I want to do with my life and seem held back by my depression. I found this site one night after feeling really depressed over something that I can't even remember now in the hope talking to people who knew how I felt and what I was going through.

1,"What's the deal with my husband's future best friends wife? Hi everyone, I am having a problem and I'm not sure what to do about it. I am led to believe that my future husband's (married next month) best friend's wife dislikes me, but I'm getting mixed signals. I have always (I thought) been nice to her. When we hang out as couples, everything is fine and we get along great. We have a similar education level and both come from a science background, so it's easy for us to talk. We have spent hours hanging out in these situations. We even all took a road trip together this past summer a few states away to attend a very lovely (albeit very strange) wedding of another of their mutual friends, and we went out to dinner and shopping while the boys were at the bachelor party. It seems like whenever I try to plan anything though, she isn't available, even if her husband is. I planned a surprise party for my fiances 30th birthday that I had been talking about for months--her husband was there, and at the last minute, she couldn't attend. He didn't even tell me she wasn't coming until he showed up without her. We visited their home on 4th of July weekend and there invited them to my parents house (they have a pool) for the holiday. He showed up, she didn't because she was ""sick"" (read: hungover.) Her husband showed up for an hour or so and she was continually calling him asking when he was going to come home and take care of her. The thing that makes me think this isnt a string of coincidences is my bridal shower. It is tomorrow, and I have found out she will not be attending. She Rsvpd to my mom with just a generic ""I can't make it, we're busy"" but then a few days later, her husband messaged my fiance asking if he wanted to hang out on the day of my shower. I have always been nice to her, and I'm not sure whats going on. Anyone in Reddit land have any advice? Her husband and my future husband have been best friends since high school and this is bugging both of us. ",MrsNacho8000.txt
0,"I don't particularly want to go into details about how I've been feeling the past couple of years, only because it's too much for me to go into, and I don't want to leave out important details or anything. In September 2005, I voluntarily admitted myself to the hospital's psych ward through my psychiatrist, the reason being because my depression had grown so severe that my muscles gave out and I couldn't move anymore, and my will to live had vanished entirely, I stopped eating, I was dehydrated, I stopped going to school, all I did was lay in bed all day, it's the only thing I could do. The decision to go to the hospital turned out to be a very, very big mistake, and I regret making that choice. I felt no connection with the other kids there, especially because I was a week away from turning eighteen, and most of them were thirteen, fourteen, and maybe one or two sixteen year olds. We were similar in an emotional aspect, but otherwise I couldn't relate to any of them. I just bored them, and the way they talked and the things they talked about just confused me. I did get involved with them to an extent during the last couple of days there, but I regret that now. This is a story in itself, but I also got involved with a girl there. She fell in love with me, and so did I fall in love with her, briefly. Only because a girl had never shown any attraction to me before, nor did a girl ever show any interest in me like she did. My feelings for her quickly faded after talking to her a couple of times outside the hospital. She turned out to be a real mess of a person. I did not suffer from the relationship, though. I do not talk to her anymore, and I actually became a better person because of it - I was enlightened. My depression practically disappeared following my discharge from the hospital. I don't know if it was because of the Zoloft that I had begun taking, or because I was finally free from that prison. By the way, I do have a form of claustrophobia. I am not particularly afraid of being in narrow or tight spaces... I am afraid of being locked in narrow or tight spaces. And the hospital was very small, and they did not let you leave or go where you wanted. You were confined to your room, the main recreation room, and the hallway connecting those two places. The day before I was discharged, I was constantly shaking, sweating, and going to the bathroom. I couldn't sleep, and I was afraid to move. I had to stay in my room most of the time and skip out on the group sessions. So anyway, even though I felt better right after getting out of the hospital, that quickly, VERY quickly changed. By mid-late October, I was on home-schooling (and will be until I graduate in June this year, I am a Senior in High School), and attending group therapy several days a week, as well as seeing a psychologist once a week and a psychiatrist every several weeks. All of this therapy did NOT help me. I was feeling extremely depressed and suicidal one night, after a brief fight with my dad (I accidentally bumped the curb while parking, he yelled at me to watch the curb, and I got very upset, pulled the parking break, and walked off while screaming about slitting my throat...), and called one of the therapists at my group therapy to help me. I'd locked myself in a room in my grandmother's basement, and I had called her so she could talk with me and help me to relax. Instead, she threatened to call the police if I didn't open the door and let my dad in. So I opened it, but after that I completely lost my trust in her and couldn't stand being around her anymore. Another counselor at the group therapy also lost my trust. I felt a connection with him, and trusted him a lot, so I told him about my girlfriend (whom I had met online - another story) and he kept on accusing me of things... like using her for sex, or not really being in love, and etcetera. So after having lost trust in two therapists, and then all sorts of insurance problems came up. I stopped going. A few weeks ago, I stopped going to my psychologist as well. I felt like I was being lectured by him instead of actually helped... On top of that, he was taking weekly co-pay from me while he knew my insurance did not require co-pay for anything psychological! (i.e. Counselors, psychologists, psychiatrists, etc.) And he still owes me a couple hundred bucks. He also charged my insurance for appointments I had cancelled. Basically, I took two steps forward, and then three steps back. My depression is not as bad as it was in September 2004, but I am pretty much tired of living. I am constantly thinking of suicide, and have even written brief suicide notes and made plans (which I never carried out). My Zoloft has been at 150mg for the past couple of months. It's helped my social anxiety slightly, but my depression - no. I am aware of the state that I am in, and I am simply tired of it. My future is all dark, I don't see things getting better. When I spoke with my girlfriend this weekend, I cried the entire night...  I just couldn't take everything anymore. I saw a new psychologist last week, but again, I feel like I'm being lectured. I am eighteen years old, and being talked to as if I were twelve. It's insulting and makes me feel even more left out of things than I already do. I don't know. ",mindslave_e_1_a_1_us.txt

The Day I Cried   ------------------------------------            “Those that I fight I do not hate,        Those that I guard I do not love;”  - (An Irish Airman Foresees His Death, W.B. Yeats)      It was all white in the room,    The corpse in his winding sheet,    My aunt in a new white sari,    Staring into the silence where he had gone.    I could hear the leaves rustle outside the window, But I didn’t cry.      She had gone crazy, my mom whispered,    Between her sobs, “She is just 25, the poor girl”    I just continued to look down,    At the mosaic floor, not registering a word.

I really miss being with someone and I am definitely looking for love - which is very unlike me.  Greg and I went out last night. I haven't seen him all summer. He was amazingly beautiful as always. It was the first time my friends were introduced to him. My girlfriends went on and on about how hot he was. Eric, my ex, was actually the first to tell me, ""he is a handsome guy,"" which I thought was really funny. We got extremely drunk and danced all night long. He came home with me, but I puked before anything could happen.  I like Greg. He is smart and he challenges me intellectually. He is also a great dancer and an awesome kisser. I just dont know if I want a man in my life. I've developed this weird fear of men when it comes to intimacy. Things are a bit different with Greg, probably because he's not acting like he is in love with me. I wonder when he will call again....  Other then that, I am actually considering meeting up with Internet friends at the lesbian bar on Saturday. I'll probably chicken at the out last minute.

1,"Being Manipulated Hi, so, I recently met this new group of people, and it's been pretty nice being with them, but there's this one girl that I have a crush on. About a week ago, one of my friends whom I have known for ~4 years told her, and she said there was a high chance she would go out with me, and has been telling me stuff she has said, and he said that if I was going to ask her out, I should wait 1-3 weeks. Well, recently, they seem to be getting closer and closer to each other, and I have heard that he has a crush on her as well, and wants her to date him instead of me, and when I asked him about it, he got all defensive about it. For a little bit of extra context, he said that he wouldn't ask her out, but would be open to dating her. What should I do? Edit: He said he was trying to get her to go out with me, and said he was helping me. ",imfeelingbetrayed.txt

1,"Through time all the conflict in society essentially boils down to either greed, power,  or a difference in opinions otherwise unresolvable. From the biggest wars to a fight on the playground it's always one of those 3 things. So you might be wondering what the hell that has to do with anything. My point out of that is that conflict is inevitable and necessary. I can't stand people who think everyone should just tolerate everything even if it conflicts with their own personal views. That's like telling me I should hold out my hands and let someone take a shit on them and like it. Do you have to agree with me, Hell No! Do I have to agree with you, Hell No! What if we just can't come to an agreement............then it's time for a fight!

Right now she is almost done with college but I still have to take some courses so we don't see each other that often. That's why she told me two weeks ago we should meet up. I told her to pick out the day which suit her best. She said Monday and I agreed. Turns out my mum needed money so I have almost nothing on me and because of that I told her I could hang out but couldn't go to the restaurant she said we should try. She replied that she ""couldn't make it tomorrow"" (today) and I thought wth?! you said Monday? It was you the one who said Monday not me... Anyway she said let's meet up on Wednesday and I said ok but tbh I don't feel like going out whatsoever. She was sorry because, and I quote, ""I thought we were going to meet today"" and I'm like dafuq. She, all of a sudden, forgot about it?! Does it make any sense? I guess she made plans with other people or whatever but fuck it, don't say one thing and then act like you didn't even say anything. I know I'm overreacting here but I'm so fucking tired of people and their ""you're my best friend"" and ""I love you, I care about you"" shit.

1,"How I'm coping with the end of a friendship... I'm writing this partly because I find it therapeutic and partly because I'm hoping it'll help others.( I have self-proclaimed good coping skills.) So, my XBFF didn't do anything [i]to[/i] me. There was no defining moment. I just decided that (as much as I love her) she doesn't compliment my life anymore. She's having a few relationship issues. As a married woman, I empathize with her. However, over the last 6 months she's started to get a little... Crazy. I'm a very blunt and controversial person. Always have been, always will be. I keep an IG account full of controversial and offensive memes. Some people like it, some people don't. Anyway, I've been going through a rough time myself so I cope by posting passive-aggressive memes. Every single thing I post she takes personally. It got to the point in which everything I said or did (online or in the real world) she somehow thought was about her. It wasn't. It got to the point in which I was afraid to speak because I was afraid she'd take something the wrong way. Anyway, she went an entire week without speaking to me even though I sent her multiple texts. Maybe this was the moment, but I decided that I will not tolerate that type of power struggle. We're adults - you don't get to ignore someone because you don't like what they're saying and that's always been an issue with her: if she doesn't like what you have to say she comes up with delusional explanations as to why. Basically, she can never be wrong and if you think one negative thing about something related to her, she'll freak out, accuse you of being jealous even though she's the one not actually happy. The negativity is starting with her. For example, we tried to book a trip together. We've been trying for years and they never happen. Finally, I just told her that I'm no longer interested in planning trips with her because she's not willing to accommodate my demanding work schedule. Now, she's the first to admit her job is shit and it's been a huge source of insecurity for her, but when I tell her that my job doesn't allow me to book off as easily as hers (she works cash and doesn't really have a true job) she'll freak out and accuse me of putting her down. No. I'm stating the facts: You can book off your job easily. I can't. That's not me putting down your job. That's me telling you why I can't tell my boss on Friday I'm leaving for two weeks the following Monday. (This is just one example, but they all pretty much follow the same context: Something TRUE she doesn't like about herself is brought to attention and she accuses you of being a bad friend.) After a week of being MIA she decides to text me. No. It doesn't work like that. I'm not interested in what she has to say. So, I tell her to get over herself, not everything in the world revolves around her, etc. Of course, she thinks she's completely innocent and that all she was trying to do was explain HER feelings and I tell her I'm not interested. Again, it's not always about her. She did not once seek clarification about ANYTHING I said. She jumped to random conclusions and just assumed I sit here and think about her. In the end, that's what frustrates me. I just can't be friends with someone who thinks everything is about her. In sum, I just decided to protect myself. ",customerservicevoice.txt

0,"Anyone else feel they are unloveable? TLDR: I feel I have no friends and anybody I get close to leaves I started noticing I was always unhappy and sad in my last year of high school. I didn’t understand the point of life anymore and everyday driving to school I just thought how easy it was to drive off a cliff on the way to school. I got scared and told my parents who helped me get professional help. I confided in my 3 best friends at the time and almost immediately I noticed 2 of them stopped talking to me. The third I’m still friends with but not nearly as close as I used to be. When I went to college, my roommate and I became best friends but a year later, he decided to drop out and leave. I realize this is through no fault of my own but it still sucks losing a best friend. Finally, my 3rd year of college, I met the most amazing woman. With her help, I felt like I finally defeated depression. We dated for 2 years and I was so sure we were gonna last. However, I got a job on the east coast whereas we were both from the west coast. We decided we could last through the distance so I took the job and moved 3000 miles away. She just told me it wasn’t working out and broke up with me. She was my best friend and my girlfriend for 2 years. I never felt a connection with anyone else as strong as I did for her. Now I’m fearing my depression may have come back. I’m thinking I didn’t defeat depression but instead had her to use as a support. I’m here on the east coast of the US and I have no friends or family around me. I don’t know what to do and everyday I just feel like it’s me vs the whole world. I’ve already lost all hope and I feel like I don’t deserve happiness. Why else would happiness be ripped from me every time I feel like I found it. Sorry for the long post I just didn’t know where else to turn to ",doped_turtle.txt
0,"Reddit Secret Santa Saved My Life... I want to begin this by saying that I've been in a really dark place recently. Combination of family issues, breakup, and finals put me in a really depressive state. As a result, I'd been having strong suicidal thoughts for weeks. I had been seriously thinking about ending my own life. So that's the context in which this occurs. About a month ago I signed up for secret santa on a whim. I had never done it before and honestly didn't expect anything. But yesterday, my gift arrived. I don't know who this person is, but they spent at least $150 dollars on about 6 separate gifts. They also included a really thoughtful and touching letter that talked about how they thought I was such a great person and how much they enjoyed learning about me. I immediately broke down crying upon reading it. It might seem small or sorta stupid, but it made me feel like someone cared about me. That I wasn't the idiotic nobody my depression tells me I am all of the time. I felt motivated and happy for the first time in weeks. I cleaned my room and did work that I'd been ignoring for months. I finally felt like maybe, just maybe, I meant something. It changed my life, and probably saved it. So whoever you are, thank you so much, and I can't express how much this meant to me or thank you enough. And let this be a lesson to everyone else. The smallest act can and does make a difference. Let's all try and use the Christmas season to ensure everyone feels a little more loved. ",throwawaychristmas-y.txt
1,"How to Make Friends When No One Likes You A little background, in 4th grade my teacher would encourage bullying me (she got fired the end of the year) and I pretty much grew up taught it was okay to be bullied, so I never learned to stand for myself.

I am friendly and I try to be as outgoing as I can, it feels like everyone is keeping me at an arm's distance though. Is it me? It must be, I don't know why but something about me just makes others hate me. I'll ask how someone's day is going and often the reply is just a short ""pretty good"" and then that's it. I refuse to beg for friendship or to force anyone to talk to me so when they walk away or leave I'll just accept it, wave and say ""see ya around"" or etc. How do I get people to be my friend though?

However, she's just such, such an amazing person, that even if we weren't romantically involved, I would want her in my life, as a friend, because she's just so great - no joke. I'm not sure what her impression of me is. My crush and I actually have a ton of mutual acquaintances and friends. We've even worked together on an event before, but it was a large scale event with a large team, so I didn't really feel much. She once even smiled at me when she saw me! I have a friend who once had a guy give her chocolate that he “couldn’t finish” when we were in the library. The next day, he messaged her on Facebook, saying she probably felt weirded out by what he did – she responded to him, and they started talking to each other. They’ve now been dating for over a year. The bottom line is, with all this information in mind, how do I approach my crush to hopefully start a friendship with her? I've been warned that I should draw a mental boundary between feelings of friendship and romantic feelings, which I’m set on doing. I would do what my friend’s boyfriend did, but with these chocolate chip cookies I baked, though I'm not sure if it'd be a good idea. It would seem a little weird, wouldn’t it? Even with my friend’s boyfriend, we knew his intentions from the start. My crush and I are both girls, however, so I suppose that changes things a little (we do live in a heteronormative society). With all that said, I’m pretty desperate, as she’s graduating soon, and I really don’t want to miss my chance. She's completed all her subjects and is currently only working on her dissertation. She's often in the student lounge, doing work - though I'm not sure what her schedule is like and what days she's in campus.

1,"Fight! Fight! Fight! Hey Reddit community, I need to know if I’m in the wrong in a certain situation... So a friend and I, lets just call him Kevin, have been good friends for years and have always gotten along (for the most part) pretty well. Earlier this week, though, he was poking fun at me about a certain rumor he had heard about me from a mutual friend of both of ours. The rumor was completely false and out of left field, so much out of left field, that I confronted the mutual friend and asked them what the fuck they were doing. Now, this mutual friend had told my friend Kevin about this rumor and they laughed about it and he made fun of me for it in a pretty brutal, but still jokingly, manner, but decided to drag me in front of the whole squad about it before he asked me whether it was actually true or not. It still bugged me, though, that this mutual friend was talkin shit to who knows who else, spreading this false rumor and whatnot, so I decided to control this mutual friend about the rumor. The mutual friend was surprised that I confronted them about it, and complained to Kevin and thought that it was “weird” that I would confront someone who was spreading false shit about me. Now apparently this mutual friend cut ties with me (I think it’s funny and I wasn’t good enough friends with them to actually care), but Kevin is extremely angry at me and we haven’t talked to each other or about it since, making me think that things will naturally go south. I admit I may have overreacted although I don’t think I’m in the wrong, so I refuse to apologize. Any advice, Reddit community?

I am 32 years old, I was very close to my mother.. We had a bond that was as strong as steel. My dad whom she was with since the age of 15 left her 11 years ago for another woman and found happiness. She had never been with any other man. I have an older sister that is 42 and we had different relationships. My mother was angry and could never get over my dad, year after year we would hear how much she hated him but still loved him, she would wish they could be one again. It never happened, she had been with no one and remained lonley for 11 years. Her depression became her life, it was so bad we would stop talking to her because all she would talk about is killing herself and how she hated my dad. 10 years of it, She had little money and was very sick, She went from healthy to brittle in a matter of 10 years. Back surgery's, aching bones, depression, pain pain and more pain. It became up to me and my sister to take care of her, she couldn't drive so we always had to drive over to take her to the dr, groceries or to get things she needed, it became stressfull and we would somtimes bicker over it..even after the divorce my dad helped when he wanted to or could. She started thinking she was a burden.. then started lashing out on us at times, I went a whole year not speaking to her until she called me to apologize for her horrible words with me. I forgave her and we began a relationship again...this time it was amazing again, we got along and finally after 10 years she accepted my partner. Long story short drama hit the fan again in early Nov this year. Things were said between her and my sister and they got me involved, I got upset with my mom and she was so hurt and thought that I thought she was a liar. My sister told me she said something about my son that she claimed she didn't. I didn't care after a while, I had plans with her on the day before thanksgiving to go see her.. on the 19th of NOV. She asked on the 19th if i could come hook up her VCR so she could watch A Christmas Story, I told her next weekend, then she later that night got upset again, she texted all of us the usual suicide talk. I had told her the day before that I didn't want anymore drama, if i went over with my family I didn't want to hear about my dad and sister. I just wanted to have a good time. She then texted me and a lot of other family that she loved me. that it wasn't my fault, she bought the gun... (I took her to get that gun for protection so I always told her if she did that I would feel to blame) She would say "" SON I bought it! Dont feel to blame"" I hated that! Still I never belived she would do it.. I was so bitter about her not wanting to be possitive I hadent called her. I ignored her suicide text and just decided to let her cool off.. 20th, 21st-29th we hadnt spoken.. I had a bad feeling but didnt know why.. she hadnt called.. so i figured she was angry with me.. I get a call from my aunt on my dads side who she was very close with.. ""Is it true? The rumors about your mom?"" I was picking up my kids from school.. I said ""huh? what she say about me this time hahaha?"" ""Call your sister"" she said.. I called and she told me to go home right away.. Then she said when getting home "" Mom... mom... *cries*... Moms dead.. she killed herself"" I said ""dont say that"" about 12 times breaking down more and more each time I repeated it.. I fell apart crying for who know how long... day one was hard, day two was harder, day 3 was numb and empty and I couldn't cry or sleep, day 4 I then hit a new horrible moment.. I found out she had been in her apartment dead since the 20th.. the complex lied and said no one heard anything and thats another story.. they are being sued soon.. her body was in there so long that we will not have an open casket this week in her funeral.. Then i went into her apartment to start gathering her things.. i smelled the death and decay.. I have never felt so sick and horrified in my life. I will never forget it.. i went to where she did it and saw the carpet cut out and her bed gone.. her place was left just like I last saw it.. it killed me.. I am now on day 6 and her ceremony is tomorrow in her home town.. Idk what to think or feel anymore.. my wife is trying to support me cause her mom died when she was 17 but i am changing.. She can see it, I dont want to run my company, I dont sleep, I have this numb feeling.. I cry out of no where..

0,"I have had borderline personality disorder since I was a little kid. Although then the therapist said it was Bipolar Disorder and ADHD. Since then I have been on pretty much every medication you can imagine and even sent to a temporary mental hospital. It isn't until now that I self diagnosed myself with BPD. I don't even think my doctor really thinks I have that although considering all the research I have done I fit the description perfectly. Since the age of 13 I was being self destructive by slamming my head in the was during times of stress. The first time I starting cutting was when I was 21. This was after an ex boyfriend left me. We had only been dating for 3 months. Sad huh. This went on sporadically for about a year and a half (during that time I committed myself). Finally I started dating my next boyfriend. He told me if I didn't stop cutting he would leave me. I stopped. We dated 2 years and then broke up. I am now 27 and married to another man who is 12 years older than me. We have been married almost a year (together for 3.5 years) and about 3 months ago I started cutting again. This time it is 3 times worse and I can't seem to stop. I am covered in scars and I have even gone as far as cutting the inside of my wrist. I am currently on Wellbutrin which does seem to be working (I do have a lot of good days). Although since I started to become depressed again I have been having a hard time dealing with the fact that my husband has a son. It didn't bother me as much (just a little) before because I did my best to stay busy. Since I got married I lost all my friends and now spend every other weekend alone. Mostly in bed. I never had to play mom before so I never thought I would ever be in the position to, so I just stayed out of the way. Plus, his son doesn't like me being around. Which makes me feel worse. In my state of mind I can't deal with that. My alone time is when I cut the most. My husband and I are in therapy, my therapist wants us to work. I am not so sure I can stay with him. Although I am having a hard time leaving. I am just so tired of feeling so alone all the time and he is just not capable of being there for me. This puts extra stress on him and I don't want that. Plus, it is my fault I married him, I knew he had a kid. I guess I didn't know I would get bad again. Last week we talked about me leaving. He ran upstairs and cried (he said he will fight for me) I went straight for the exacto knife. I had suicide in mind although I see myself as a wimp in that area which makes me feel even worse about myself. I cut 5 times on the inside of my wrist but I guess not deep enough. He came down and found me. My antidepressants work almost 80% of the time but whenever I think of losing my husband I get sad and hopeless. Every time I think of staying with him and feeling the way I do all the time I get sad and hopeless. I feel cornered. Cutting make it all feel better, suicide sounds comforting. If anyone can relate or has any good advice I am welcome to it. ",ume143_e_2_b_c3c_xx.txt

0,"I'm a 24 year old woman living in Florida with my husband. I have been severely depressed for 6 months, and now looking back I can see that it actually started about a year and a half ago. If only I could go back and warn myself. Like many of you, I have been suffering depression since I was very young. In fact, I can remember being in first grade, coming home and going to bed for the rest of the night. Of course, back then it felt more like fear. In 7th grade, I asked my mother if I was a manic depressive because I had read about it and I felt I had all the symptoms. She scoffed and said it was just normal teen hormones that made me feel that way. I love my mother and she has always been there for me. I used to call her at 2 in the morning crying and she would talk to me until I felt better. However, when I call her up today, she still doesn't understand when I tell her I am depressed. She thinks I need to get up and start doing things until I snap out of it. I try to tell her I have bills screaming at me and I still can't get out of the house to find work. I think she is in denial. Now, with all of the information I find on this site, I think I may even be bipolar. When I found the man I wanted to marry, I warned him that I had experienced many deep depressions in my lifetime and that it was probably likely to happen again someday. He said he would stay by my side no matter what, and he has. Unfortunately, it is painfully apparent that he has no idea at all how to handle it. When he tries to talk to me and cheer me up, I say mean things to him until we are both raising our voices. Let me tell you, when I'm like this, I don't back down either. I usually say something hurtful and then grind my teeth in anger for a while. He gets mad too, but it is also painfully apparent that he forgives me. Then, I feel like a real jerk. I just started seeing a psychologist, since I haven't had a job since last August and it's clear that I don't know my way out of this. I have only met with her once, but I think I will like her. She has told me to do a few simple things everyday until our next meeting on Wednesday. She wants me to get 1/2 hour of sunlight everyday, 15 minutes of exercise, and try to make a simple daily schedule to follow. I'm a bit worried because I haven't been able to do them because I just don't sleep right anymore. It is 8am and I haven't slept yet. I may fall asleep in a few hours, only to toss and turn and then wake up in the evening feeling like crap. I have tried some medicines but they don't help. Have any of you had this problem? What did you do? ",downinit_e_2_a_c2_us.txt
0,"I've really hit a new low I cannot believe how depressed I am right now, I am just imploding. I got fired from yet another job for being incompetent as usual. Usually I'm pretty good at bouncing back but this job just broke something inside me. I'm a damn failure. Three attempts at college. Flunked out after the first year. That's ok, college isn't for everyone. Try a bunch of min wage jobs. Get fired or quit with in the first month or two. I can't do damn thing. I have no motivation to do anything at all anymore. I used to clock around 3-4 hours a day gaming because it was something I genuinely enjoyed. I've gotten 30 minutes in an entire damn week. I literally just can't muster the strength to want to do it. I've been pulling away from people because it's just exhausting to talk to them. I literally just get tired after five minutes of conversation. It's insane. We'll barely be through the how's your day been going before I already want to go somewhere else because it's so draining. I've hit a complete rock wall in therapy. I tell my therapist nearly all of this shit and she helps me as best she can but there's only so much she's able to do. She has no magic way of instilling me with motivation. Like... to put it into perspective. I stared at a wall for 2 hours today. Because I just was to tired to anything else. 2 hours! I wasn't thinking about anything. I wasn't being bored. I just don't have motivation to do anything! But what's worse is the moment I start thinking again is the moment all the sadness washes over me. It's like I'm in the middle of a vast, dark ocean and can't find shore. I swim and I swim and I swim but salvation is just nowhere to be seen. And I'm beginning to grow tired. I have no future ahead of me. Nothing to look forward too. I go through thousands of career tests and applications and all I see is that I'm either not interested enough or not good enough for any career. And I can't simply work for money. Money in and of itself just isn't good enough for me to work at a job I hate or am completely uninterested in. That's the strain of these minimum wage jobs, some of them I've had to quit because they've literally made me suicidal. I'm so lost right now. The world looks like a very dark place where I have to suffer in agony just to get by. I'm so tired of fighting. I'm so tired of trying. I'm just. So. Tired. It has been a very long time since I've been this low. I feel like I'm doomed. Like this is all the happiness I'll ever be afforded. That even if I get the job of my dreams and all the money I could possibly want, I will always have a big, dark cloud hanging over my head. Everything hurts and I hate everything about life right now. I wish I could just fall asleep and stay in my dreams. ",Autumn_Fire.txt
1,"My Father and Step-Mother sound like they will be getting a divorce. I have three half siblings whom I'm relatively close to, two of them are teenagers and still under their parents' care. Anyways long story short it's my father's consumption of alcohol that's causing the damage. He does well for awhile then doesn't and it's been going on like this for years. Unfortunately my father and I aren't that close. It almost feels like we're walking acquaintances inside the same home when we have dinner together as a family. He seems distant to everyone in our family as well, it can be hard for him to open up. I think my father is really depressed, but he refuses to see a therapist or anything like that.  He may be going through some sort of (late) midlife crises right now. He still works his job and apparently brings home enough money to support his family. My step-mother took me aside and looked worried about her situation. She expressed that she may need to get legal help, and is concerned about protecting her children. At this point, I'm going to try and open up to my Dad and just point blank ask him what's going on with his life? He's about to lose his wife of 25+ years and hit a hard rock bottom. I hate to see him do this as he's been a pretty good Dad overall, and always provided for his family... at least keeping our heads above water financially. Any thoughts about how to approach alcohol use and possibly getting a stubborn old man to seek help? I know it's gotta be on his terms and everything, but I don't know what else to do. Thanks!

1,"Losing my brother My brother died suddenly Friday night. He was 38. He was pretty much estranged from most of the family, spent some years making bad decisions and doing drugs and it caught up to him. He was trying to straighten out his life and cut out drugs and negative friends, from what I’d heard. He was in the ICU recently with heart failure and pneumonia. We talked while he was in the hospital, a lot of apologies and crying and encouragement, just a brother and sister having a conversation. The next day his blood pressure was supposedly good enough for him to be released. 10 days later, he was gone. My family members are taking it in their own ways. We all had unresolved things, a relationship we were hoping to rekindle, a bond I wanted to forge again with my big brother. He was my best friend and hero growing up. My biggest challenge as an adult. I feel so much regret and heartache over this, I can’t even begin to explain. He didn’t have an easy life. We lost a lot, he went through a lot, some of it was because of his choices, I really feel he was trying to make it right but it was just too late. We lost our grandpa and dad in the last 2 years, now my brother who was the first born grandson. I don’t think I’ll ever get over this. ",mj6578.txt

1,"Relationship with my Dad Hey, I post this as I need help on how to deal with the situation on my relationship with my Dad. Don't get me wrong, I do love him- however I am not sure that I like him to the extent that he likes me. By like, I mean as a ""buddy"" relationship, we have similar interests and we talk about these interests a lot, but his personality irritates me and we have gotten in a lot of arguments, of which I never convince him. I am currently in University, I am living on campus (this is the first time living on my own), and I must say: I am absolutely loving it. Having my first time being independent has made me feel much better. Mainly because I am away from home. I have this thing where I just want to be independent, not influenced by other people's views/thoughts (my Dad mainly). A couple of years ago my Mum and Dad broke up, I stayed with my Dad as I did not agree with what my Mum had done. Me and my Dad were always close as we are both into Gaming and watching TV shows etc... but it is only recently that I have realized I dislike him. My Dad can be quick at losing his temper, he lives by the policy of Honesty (which is a good trait), but at the same time- he is completely contradicting. In arguments we get into, I explain my view and so does he, however he turns my view against me and then later apoligises for not understanding, making sure he will listen better in future. This never happens. This has persisted over the years and it makes me feel uneasy talking to him about anything. I then feel guilty about not wanting to talk to him. Which brings me to my next issue. He talks to me daily. Once in morning, some points during the day and then at night. I understand this is his first time living alone too, but I need my space and it is physically and mentally draining having to talk to him. Especially as I feel forced to keep the conversation going. Pretty much the majority of the conversation is me talking about my day, my thoughts on things and anything interesting that happened. He briefly mentions his stuff, but then there is silence. I try to keep the conversation flowing, but it does NOT feel natural at all. It is not like the conversations I have with my friends or other members of the family. Which again, makes me feel guilty when I want to hang up. I really have tried to change my perspective. It is getting close to moving back home (I am a first year student) and will be commuting from my home town to University for the upcoming years at Uni. I am really not looking forward to this. I am enjoying spending time AWAY from home, to avoid my Dad. Now I am going to have to live with him for the next few years. Now I do love him, and he does everything for me. He is trying to pay off my Student loans so I feel comfortable, and I have been saving for my deposit that I will put on a house after my time at Uni. But the issue is, I really want independence. I feel guilty that I want to live in the city where my Uni is and work to pay joint rent with friends. This way I learn the world of work, but that comes with having higher stress as I'd have to work and study. Which is what my dad doesn't agree with. And trying to explain to him that I want to learn the world of work does not compute with him. As rationally speaking, there are many more benefits of me commuting. And I cannot win, I really can't. He wants me to get the best oppotunity I can in life, and make sure that I get my Masters. But, he is deciding and forcing my path for me. I feel restricted and it makes me feel down most days for each time I have to talk to him. It just reminds me of the next 3 years being stuck at home with him, him thinking we have this great relationship where I just prefer literally anything else. Thank you. ",thr0wMeAway5.txt

1,"Cheap gifts on the Receiver's side My friend and I are friends for about 5 years. We ended up going to different colleges, but kept in contact online. I think of them as my best friend, but i'm not sure if it is reciprocated. Every year I stress about giving a good gift for their birthday and xmas. A gift too expensive makes them feel uncomfortable by setting expectations. A gift too cheap devalues our friendship and being on the receiving end feels terrible. I purchased their birthday gift is about $12 (Lush soap), and the Christmas gift is about $8-10 (sweets). The price of the cards are not included. They got me a small notepad that looked like it came from the dollar store for my birthday, and a couple stickers for Xmas. There was no card included or even a piece of paper that had my name on it. Last year they got me a $15 gift with the receipt for my birthday. My gifts were around the same value (~$15). I try not to place too much importance on the price tag, since it is the thought that counts, but their gift to me is really cheap (~$1-2), and looked like it was slapped together an hour before we met. I know they can afford to buy a gift. They buy coffee every couple days and bought lunch to the point where the staff remembered their order. I accepted their gift, but it was really hard to avoid showing my disappointment. I honestly thought it would of been better if they just didn't give me a gift at all. Is this a sign? Are they trying to tell me something or do they really think of me so little? I'm not sure what they are thinking or what should I do. I know giving them a similarly cheap gift is an option, but I would rather know why they thought to give me this gift. I could also brush this off as a one time thing, but I think that this is not the case. ",sock-monster.txt
1,"Cameron woke up at 4:00 a.m. from a strange noise coming from the kitchen. She thought it must have been Mrs. Chives from upstairs doing something. Cameron is a cautious girl, so she got up to check it out, just in case. She grabbed her pepper spray from the drawer of her bedside table and slowly walked towards the kitchen door. She pushed the door half way open, quietly, and stuck her head inside. She looked around the kitchen, but didn't see anything. Being annoyed by the whole ordeal, she dragged herself back to bed. She almost fell asleep again, untill she heard someone humming at the end of the hallway, with a woman's voice. Cameron is also a very down-to-earth girl, so she tried to find a reasonable explenation for it... it's like a reflex. ""Maybe someone is lost or something..."" she said to herself in a trembling voice. The humming sound kept getting louder and more intence, and the room got a bit cold. Her bedroom door was half open, and the only thing that lit up the room a bit was the moonlight, shining through the window. She kept staring at the hallway and breathing heavily, listening to the humming sound. She thought of asking who it is, but she wasn't that bold. Out of the darkness from the hallway, she could see two bright red eyes... she just sat up on her bed and had her eyes wide open. She didn't know what to do, so she panicked. She closed her eyes tight and tried to convince herself that it was just a dream. As soon as she opened them, she saw a shadowy figure standing at the foot of her bed, with the bright red eyes. It whispered something to her, but she couldn't understand it, mostly because she was terrified and extremely anxious. It reached over to Cameron's face, and she could see it's hand in the moonlight, it was as white as snow. Before she could do anything, her window opened and someone jumped inside! The figure with the red eyes turned, facing the other person. It started hissing, and it vanished in thin air. Cameron couldn't believe her eyes!      Who is that someone who saved her?

1,"One of my biggest downfall is that I'm too emotional. I realized this today, right now, before I logged on. My ""being emotional"" is causing a big problem. You don't realize how much you love someone until they're gone. Ever heard of it? Yeah, it's the famous cliche that you never think you can relate to.. until it happens. No it hasn't happen to me but I feel that I'm getting close and it hurts. I don't want to give up but what if he has? What if he's just ""over it""? You know that could be it. I'm all messed up. I should have stuck to the idea that he's too good for me. I told him from the beginning that I'm no good for him but he wouldn't listen. He just wanted what he couldn't have and now he has it he doesn't want it. Why? I'm mean, why do people function like this? I have to admit, I don't exclude myself from this terrible disease. But why? Why do people always want what they can't have? Because it's challenging. That's it.  I need some alone time. Some time to think things through. When I told him yesterday that the longer we are together the more scared I get, I did mean the more scared I get to lose him but as I was thinking today, I think I am scared. I don't know of what because I've been wanting this for so long now. After I got baptized, this just became more real than ever. This is it Antoinette. This is all for real. No joke. So what's so scary about that? I guess this is what they call cold feet. This is the time that the questions start rolling in. Do I really want to tie down so soon? Can I help make it work FOREVER? Will the love last FOREVER? Do I really love him? Does he really love me? Is this really love? Are these even questions you bring up in a deep, deep conversation? Am I being too emotional? I need some alone time. Some time to think things through because this is for real. No joke. I want to do the right thing because deep down inside my little heart, it sure feels like the right thing.

Nobody else that I know has had depression as severe as mine, or has ever been in this position where the choices are: be miserable forever, or zap your brain which might seemingly cause permanent memory damage and may not even work after all that. Last night was the first time I’ve felt really suicidal in a while (mostly I’ve just been miserable and haven’t even been motivated to plan my suicide). Why go through all these awful, invasive treatments when I could just end it quickly and quietly and then everyone else could get back to their lives? I feel like an immense burden. I’ve been severely depressed for the better part of 2 years at this point. It has totally disabled me, robbed me of a career I loved, and made most things difficult or unbearable. I’ve tried 7 different drugs to try and get it and my anxiety under control. No cigar. I don’t necessarily want to die, I just don’t want to live, if that makes sense. I feel as if my husband, friends, and doctor are keeping me artificially alive with all these treatments that don’t work, when in reality, I’m that painfully sick dog that needs to just be put down already.

1,"My wife wants another baby, I don't. Are we headed for divorce? Hi all,  I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this so let me know if it's not.  The title pretty much is why I'm here but let me give you some background. My wife and I dated for about a year before she got pregnant.  We quickly got married and had our first girl in 2005.  In 2008 we had our son, followed by our third, another girl, in 2009.  We were crazy busy for a while there and things finally calmed down a few years ago.  We made up for that by deciding that we should move to a nicer area.  We live in Vancouver where property costs a fortune.  To afford that, my wife had to go back to work full time.  She had been working 3 days a week.  She is a teacher so she still gets the summers, Christmas and spring break at home with the kids.  She kind of half joked about having a fourth child before the move but when we moved it was clear that we couldn't afford another baby. Now we've been in our new home for about 1.5 years.  The kids have made new friends, settled into their new school and sports teams.  Our oldest will be heading to high school next year. Now my wife wants a new baby.  She is obsessed with it.  It's all she thinks about and all she talks about.  She says the kids are getting older and they're not going to need her soon and she's getting depressed about it.  Every couple weeks it boils over and we fight or she bursts into tears again. I don't want another baby.  Our youngest is 8, our oldest is 12.  I don't want to go back there.  I've moved on from the baby stage and I love where we're at right now.  We are crazy busy with sports and activities most of the year (hockey x2, baseball x3, swimming, art class, etc....).  I am happy where we are, I don't feel like anything is missing, there's no hole in my life. If we were to have another baby, we'd have to move again.  Change the kids schools again.  Have the kids meet new friends again and join new sports teams again.  I don't want to do that to them.  I've also been carrying the financial burden for the last 12 years as my wife had finally give back to work full time.  I'm not saying she wasn't working at home taking care of the kids, she was.  I am saying that if we missed a mortgage payment, that was on me and it's stressful and it's nice to have some sort on that department once again. I don't really know what to do, I'm afraid we're headed for a divorce but that's the last thing I want.  Should I have a baby so she won't divorce me?  What if we're in the same spot eight years from now when the baby starts to grow up a bit.  I asked her if she would go speak to a counselor with me but she says it won't change her mind that she wants another baby. ",woohoo-77.txt

1,"Help with/what to do about toxic sister? (Sorry for sloppy wall and if this isn't the right thread) As the title says I don't know what to do about my 29 year old sister. She is known by the family to be immature, selfish, and impulsive. She repeatedly burns bridges with family when she does not get her way and will give them the short end of a deal if it benefits her (ie. Not paying my financially struggling mother back on the multiple occasions of covering her rent or car payment because she decided to use her paycheck on a new TV or $200 purse). I'd love to not speak to her and never go to her place but because she is the mother of my 2 year old niece this is not possible. To give you some perspective, she has fights with my niece's father who got their old apartment raided by the police for selling heroin (finding heroin and a pistol in a safe in the apartment) to the point of yelling and hitting, even late at night when the child should be asleep, right in front of my niece. Because her father is soon going on trial and to prison for a long time (ex convict in possession of a firearm on top of selling heroin) and as previously stated, my sister being a half-assed parent, I am left to clean up after her when it comes to my niece. I have to be consistent in teaching her not to hit people and not to spit at them. Again, to give you some perspective, I am 15 years old and do not need the stress of making sure a child grows up to be a decent person on my plate. My sister has multiple DUI and assault charges which have resulted in her drivers license being revoked yet she continues to drive with my niece in the car even when everyone who knows her and cares about the child tells her not to. Although she is better now she is still a complete ass of a parent with her first kid dying before the age of one and losing custody of her two other sons about 9 years ago (older one being 13 and the other being 9). I am actually convinced her uterus is hexed because every time she has a kid shit goes horribly south which makes me terrified in the case of my niece. In the winter of 2016 my sister attempted suicide (my niece being just under 1) and while her drug dealer boyfriend screamed at her while she laid on the floor saying she wanted to die I had to make sure the child was still sleeping through all of it in the next room. Now although few and far apart, I've had my struggles with depression so I understand how difficult postpartum depression can be but even then I believe as a parent you always put the child first in every scenario. On top of everything else she completely spoils my niece buying her an unnecessary amount of toys and candy whenever she reaches for it at the store and I know she is not going to be able to handle it when my niece wants something at the mall my sister absolutely cannot afford at the moment and her entire worldview changes when she realizes she does not get everything she wants when she wants it. Although I mostly enjoy being alone and I have never been in a relationship I can only imagine possible significant others would not be totally understanding when I try to explain that my niece comes first which only adds to the stress and worry. To be clear, my sister is not neglectful and provides for my niece with everything a child needs such as diapers, food, bed, cleaning, etc. but if she continues this way (which I know she will) my niece will grow up with the same characteristics as my sister and it's just about all up to me to make sure that doesn't happen. Can someone please, PLEASE help me? ",cutthroatzuckerberg.txt

0,"I think I may have been on this forum (it looked different) back in 2002 when I had a major bout with depression and anxiety due to some serious financial worries. I've always been prone to this I guess, but I'm starting to figure out that it's big, nasty life-changes that trigger it. Well, here I go again. This time it's relationship-related. My wife and I are on brink of divorce. I found out almost a year ago that she has been emotionally involved with another man, and was no longer ""in-love"" with me. We somehow muddled through the next several months, even though I found out it was still going on, we kept ""trying"" anyway, and things were still tolerable and ok, I guess. (We still shared same bed, got affectionate, cuddled and even made love). About 3 weeks ago, I discovered that it still had not ended, and they were actually conspiring on getting together in March. Well, all hell broke loose and things got worse than ever. I'm now in a separate room, sleeping on a single bed, and I'm miserable. I resumed Wellbutrin when this all started last spring (I took Wellbutrin for about 9 months when I had my episode in 2002), and have been taking it since. But since this really bad turn of events, I knew I couldn't take it, and to be honest, even before I discovered again, my therapist told me that I need to revisit my doctor and prescriptions because I've got some serious anxiety issues. So now I just started Zoloft (25mg/day) in addition to the Wellbutrin. I don't know how things are going to turn out. I'm in ""limbo"" while I give her ""time and space to figure things out."" The Zoloft I think started to kick in today, but not in a good way. I'm actually feeling MORE depressed when I came in this morning...I almost broke down crying in front of my computer -argh! My mood swings are horrible. All I can think about is going home and crawling into my bed and taking an Ambien, even though I hate that bed and want to be in the big bed with my wife. I almost wish at times that she would just say, ""That's it, we're done"", so I can know what is going on and just move on with my life. I may end up single and lonely anyway, but at least I'll have the opportunity to look for someone else. Right now I feel like a prisoner, being starved of basic human needs, like hugs, touches, affection. (Doesn't that sound lame from a guy???????  ) Well, anyway, here I am....here for the ride....

0,"Hi everyone, I am new to this site and my name is Elie. I am a 38-year-old married mother of three girls and one angel baby boy who was born still 10/30/2003. My children's ages are 18 years old, 15 years old then it would have been Conner Charles. When we lost Conner due to an underlying infection and when I had the amniocentesis the infection got to Conner and he died a month later. That was very devastating to us but I have had a lot of support with an infant grief group in our area. After we lost Conner three months later we got pregnant with Charlene and she is so beautiful. Anyway things were going good (oh I forgot to mention the fact I remarried my ex husband. We were divorced for 14 years and we got back together). One day when the baby was 11 months old my husband accidentally spilled hot coffee onto Charlene's leg and she had a blanket sleeper on so she wasn't that bad. It was bad enough but because of the way the burn looked (due to the absorption of the stupid hot coffee) the doctor had her removed from our care until they could further decide if the baby was abused. I was dumbfounded; I have known this doctor for 17 hears with my girls Marissa and Jessica, so how dare he. I was so upset, but we have a DSS worker in our lives because of my middle daughter who has mental retardation, she is in a residential home because of her behaviors which in a way was excellent for us. Our worker seen and knew Charlene before the foster care and then when she finally saw her at foster care she did everything in her power to get the baby back and we did six days later. We are constantly in and out of court now because of this and then my husband was feeding the baby oatmeal and I was warning him to be careful she flails her arms, well she flailed and knocked the spoon out of his hand and the clump of oatmeal landed on her face ... we cleaned her up not noting anything bad as she didn't cry or nothing she wanted to eat. She ended up with a blister on her cheek in the spot that the oatmeal touched. We almost lost Charlene again. I went into DSS and said my husband was no longer going to be in charge of the baby and they felt better and I also said he wants parenting classes and they liked that idea. But this is my problem, how do I get passed this. I have a counselor already but you can never have too much support so I came to this web site. I can't even make love with my husband anymore. I resent him for putting me through this when I have been the most careful mother around. We also live with his mother because financially things are tight and right now its better we do because DSS notes it is a very supportive environment and I have a lot of help which I do but I can't leave otherwise I will have DSS up my back quite often. My husband feels that sex is the cure all to depression, he keeps hounding me and hounding me and I just don't want sex. When we first got back together this second time around things were awesome and we had so much fun but then we lost Conner, then had Charlene and then these burns and losing her and going to court. I have no say whatsoever even in my own room which depresses me but soon I will try and figure out how to get out of this. All I know is my husband better respect my wishes, I just can't make love at the moment. The last time was four weeks ago.

In highschool, I never had a ""group"" of friends per se, but I knew almost everyone in my grade, and was friends with a lot of them. After high school, I went to a local university, so I'd have to commute to my school, unlike the rest of my classmates who went to to schools further away. My current university is a huge commuter school, so there's no on campus experience to be had, and I'm actually transferring to a local community college instead, so I can transfer out later.

This is a record low point in my life, but tonight I changed how I feel about it by just getting some chores done, getting drunk, and treating myself the way I wish other people would treat me. I'm talking booze and watching horrible telivision from the 80's And it dawns on me that I'll get another chance. I may have fucked things up this time but I've bounced back from fuckups before by just acting natural so I'm probably going to do so again. There will be more chances to treat people the way I want to be treated no matter what age I get to. I don't need someone to be nice to me, all I have ever needed in life is just to be nice to other people. It's a silly sentiment but it's all I got right now, I hope it reaches someone else who can benefit from hearing it. If you pray, pray for me in the next three months because it's  all I got. Ask me for some nice nice words and I'll give some to you as personally as I can. Things get better when you're kind to others. No matter what the haters might tell you. ",The_DM_es_numero_uno.txt

With all of the tragedy going on in our gulf coast as well as the war, I feel I have no right to be unhappy but I am 24 / 7. I am 37 years old and have made a complete mess of my life.  My parents were raised in Europe and came to the states in their 20's.  I have a younger brother who also has depression but it differs from my own.  When I look back at my childhood all I feel is pain and neglect and I can't recall any happy memories.  I don't believe that I was ever physically abused however, I do think that I was ignored and emotionally neglected. Perhaps that is why I manage to make a mess of my life every time things seem to be going well.  I'm married and have a 4 year old son.  From all outward appearances, my life comes across as perfect (although we all know there is no such thing). I have been seeing psychiatrists and therapists since I was 17 and have tried to commit suicide on four separate occasions.  My mother suffers from depression and her mother did as well.  This is such a long and complicated story and I don't know how much I am allowed to write or if anyone is even interested since this is my first try in any type of chat room.  My interior pain lies so far deep that I don't sleep, hardly eat and feel miserable all the time. I guess that is all I will say for now. ",pattymiceli_e_2_b_c3i_us.txt

1,"Yesterday when I was browsing I found this link. How? I can't even remember, I was looking for something totally different. I started reading some of the blogs and since I've been so lonely lately, I decided to try to write some of things that come to my mind. One of the things that I can start talking about is how my life has change from last year. Now I'm single again. I got a divorce. I can't say all the fault was his but mostly yes, he cheated on me. I think the hardest part has past. Now I need to look forward and try not to think about ...what if? I did everything possible to save my marriage, because I have a little daugther and I wanted her to have a family ...forever. The same way I did when I was single (the first time). I'm so lucky to have the parents I have and the sisters I have. Now I appreciate all the efforts that both my parents did to keep us all together and happy.  (Today is the birthday of one of my sisters, by the way) So, the point is that all the perspectives I had about life changed with this tragic episode in my life. Really, everything I believed before is kind of ...gone. I just hope that divorce is not the same for everyone, because mine has been hard mostly probably because of the relegion beliefs I had. I said I had cause now everything looks so different. I'm so happy for all the people that has found love, true love, now I realize that having someone to share your time and ideas is one of the most imnportant things we can have, more than money. (Of course money always helps). Sometimes I think if I will be able to trust again, you know as a partner and find someone that I can count on. Someone to grow old and have wonderful memories, Do you think is there such a person for me? Last night I was thinking about all the relationships I have had in my life and always end up the same way. Men cheating or maybe is me being to naive.   I'm liseting Rod Stewart an old song, I like to liseting the oldies, well I'm not that young, I'm 43, although I don't feel so old. I like to exercise and do a lot of things with my daugther and her friends. I guess most of the tv shows I know are from Disney channel. An about movies well most of the movies for kids.

0,"There is a genetic weakness in my family - virtually everyone has been on medications at some time, or is on medications now, for depression and anxiety disorders. It seems to onset around puberty. I have had a truly horrible time over the last 3 years supporting my depressed daughter (now aged 15) and, more recently, my 22 year old son. I have been taking 340 mg of St John's Wort once a day for about a year, but I am aware that the genes are kicking in, and I am now quite ill in my own right. I really don't want to take prescription medications, as I have seen the horrible side effects that my daughter and son have experienced as the medications have kicked in - she has had to change medications once as she reacted so badly. Just from looking at the size of the St John's Wort pills available, it is obvious that I could take a much higher dose. Does anyone know anything about dosage, and whether it would be better to take doses throughout the day rather than just once?

0,"It was Gavin and Janie's wedding last weekend and Rory came over on Wednesday evening in preparation. We spent Thursday afternoon trailing around Leeds trying to buy trousers because he claimed his current ones were too shiny for Best Man purposes. � 70 later and he forgot to wear them on the day. I also had purposes in Leeds as I had agreed to speak to a woman from Radio 4 about my experiences with depression. We got in touch with each other through a poster in SHIP asking for people willing to talk about themselves and their problems. The lady was sensible, sympathetic, informed and, most importantly, Taking A Sensible Approach. It was a far better experience than my time talking to Kerrang! Radio. Anyway, my contribution will be part of a show about depression called Is It Normal?, one of a series of four half hour shows to be aired around August looking at a variety of health issues and the normalcy or lack-thereof of each of them. The evening's journey to Southport was described as turgid. The cumulative train journey time was two and half hours, but there was a half hour break in Manchester where we raided Sainsbury's for biscuits as well. There was a reasonable amount of wildlife to be seen from the windows - I spotted two foxes, three rabbits and incalculable numbers of horses, cows and sheep. We didn't get to our hotel until after 10pm, by which time we were too tired to care about the shabbiness of our surroundings. The bathroom had mould, there was sheets not a duvet (and a woolen blanket, which, of course, I'm allergic to), one thin pillow each, dirty windows and the hotel bar closed at 11pm. I drowned my sorrows in bourbon. The biscuits that is, not the drink. Friday started grey and windy but by lunchtime the weather had cleared up and it was a beautiful, sunny day. The trip to the golf course where the wedding was taking place (don't ask) took us through pretty roads with old houses and woods. We were some of the last to arrive which was quite good as there wasn't too much time to worry about the logistics or any problems which might be about to arise. The service was quite quick, civil ceremonies usually are. The room was decked with flowers and all the men were wearing purple flowers. Janie was wearing a purple suit and Gavin was in a coordinating shirt and tie. The photographs were taken outside near the putting green but we didn't get too many strange looks: I believe weddings are quite common there. Everyone lazed around for a while before we were called in to eat. I had been told that the club had said they were more than happy to ensure I had vegan food, so I was some what taken back when they presented me something very similar to lasagna, slathered in what was clearly bechamel sauce. Then they tried to tell me it had vegetarian cheese in it. We managed to reach a compromise of being cooked vegetables in sweet and sour sauce, which turned out to be far more appetizing than I was anticipating. For dessert they tried to feed me fruit salad. My idea of fruit salad is obviously far removed from theirs however, as my glass featured some black grapes (edible), a few slices of apple (inedible), some pineapple (ditto), some melon balls (acceptable but I had melon for a starter, and that had been unripe), some orange slices (don't get me started on oranges) and a few pieces of unidentifiable fruit. Where was the raspberries and strawberries? The banana, plum, Granny Smiths, green grapes? Wasn't impressed. Later, I was practically forced by Rory to eat some chocolate coated cake (""They cost �5 each! You need to eat it!"") so on top of my own guilt, the lady who seemed to be coordinating all the food had the gall to try and tell me off for eating something which obviously wasn't vegan. What business was it of hers? We left early on Saturday morning, or what I perceive as early, at least. I wanted to stop off in Manchester to leave some posters advertising the Ladyfest All Dayer, but Rory refused, saying that he was too tired and his bags were too heavy. So we came straight home and I spent the afternoon sleeping. Afterwards we had pizza and discussed my weight problems. The solution was decided on to be no more pizza. And no more many things. I got weighed and it's far worse than I thought. We discussed the possibility of Slim Fast and diet pills, and my mum's offer of paying for liposuction. We agreed I should keep a food diary, stick to my exercise plan, cut back drastically on my calorie intake and if that doesn't make a successful impact, then to try the pills and Slim Fast, though I'd rather not have to eat that, it being full of milk. My mum said if I lose the weight I want to first then she'll pay for the remaining lumpy bits to be removed as a birthday present. Now I just need some self control again. On Monday we went to the end of year show at college. There was some wonderful things, though it seems that there have been less good exhibits every year since I started going. Are the students getting worse? Am I starting to be more critical of art? Or a combination? Rory went home afterwards and I was left alone again. Left to my food diary and my shit book (I'll Go To Bed At Noon - how it got short listed for the Booker I have no idea) and my self loathing. Bleugh. Two weeks to more hugs. Finally, it seems Jo Brand is wanting song suggestions for a compilation called Music to Drain Radiators To. Naturally... ",sarah_e_2_b_1_uk.txt

0,"Long text, I just want an audience. Why haven’t I killed myself yet? It’s not the title, but a question that lingers on the back of my head every second. It’s a common trend that people live for other people but what do you do when you have no one to live for? I never had anyone to live for. It’s not a huge problem really, its another lingering question or jealousy I have whenever I meet a person. Every single one of them have someone who cares for them, even a stranger would care for them. It makes me feel jealous that no one would care for me or even bother to be nice to me unless I open my mouth and say I have cancer or they knew about any of my situation. People don’t care, they pity me. They realize, then, that I’m a hopeless situation and they can’t help me at all because they really can’t. No one can. Therapies don’t help. My therapist knows all of my situations are out of my control and he wants me to move forward with my life. It’s not really a bad idea, it’s the smart thing to do especially being someone in my situation. I just don’t know why I can’t. Every single being on the planet wants me to graduate already but my body doesn’t agree with me. It’s always either I’m too sad/ stressed/ depressed/ ashamed/ anxious/ lazy to go to school. Nothing helps. Not even the 30mg of Lexapro helps. My school counsellor is doing the nice “I get it, I understand” approach with me and it makes me feel better but it really does make me feel guilty. I just don’t understand why are people act so shitty with me? Is it my face? Is it because no one cares and all I have is literally myself? Is it because I’m dying soon? What is it really? I just want to fucking die but I cant just let myself slash my throat or swallow a lot of pills because I’m a coward. I want the easy way out. Why isn’t cancer an instant death? Why aren’t suicide booths similar to futurama a thing? I give up. I just want to die. P.S. Fuck people who say they’re afraid of rejection because hunty what world do u fucking live in that not one single person has said no to you? P.P.S. Fuck you E, I’m sorry I disappointed you that I didn’t die yet even my diagnosis’ average life span is 6 months. Don’t worry, it’s coming. And I surely fucking hope karma is real.

You’re one of the people who deserve my revenge and yet I’m being like a pussy who is letting a fake thing called “karma” take care of everything. In this fucking lifetime, not a single one got any karma.

1,"How to get over my ex best friend Ok so all throughout high school (I graduated high school 4 years ago) I had a best friend. We were sisters literally thought we would be friends forever. We graduated I got into my first relationship and we drifted apart and she never really let me know how she felt. She told me one day she wishes I would stop talking about him so much and that kind of was like ok cool that kind of sucks but not a big deal. Being in my first relationship that I’m currently still in it sucked not being able to talk about it because I was so excited. Anyways months passed and we got into an argument and basically we ended our friendship because she thought I was an awful friend because I was too busy for her. Fast forward a year after that we started talking again (I reached out, I always do) we started being “friends” again but it felt so awkward. Honestly though she’s the only one who was ever angry and made things not feel the same. On her 21st birthday she invited everyone to her party at her house but me and told me it was because we didn’t talk much and she didn’t want awkward vibes at her house. After that I just unfollowed her on social media and we didn’t talk at all. I messaged her over the summer congratulating her to see she was taking a trip to China and then she messaged me on my birthday. This all happened in 2017 so our friendship has been fucked up for like 2 years now. Because I deleted her number a while ago I decided to reach out and talk to her on Instagram saying happy birthday and hope she was doing well and she never replied and I know she saw it. So our friendship is dead. I’ve known it’s been dead too for like 2 years now but how do I stop being so damn hurt? I think it hurts even more because she truly doesn’t give a fuck and she was my best friend ever. I wish I could go back and do something else to fix it. Idk lately I’ve cried so much.

Then later my mother found out about what i had done and became so angry with what i had done, that she made me cry, and i actually woke up crying. Then later that day i took a nap and i dreamt that i was being seduced by Tom Cruise, (who had gained a lot of weight), and when things began to heat up i rejected him, and he became very angry at me. He then later came to the house where i was, and began trying to hurt me and the people around me (which was an older lady, a young boy and teenage girl). i could hear him saying ""just kill them"" and talking about how he was really embarrassed when i rejected him, and he could do so much better than me. i then proceeded to take the young boy into hiding, and while hiding we were found and the boy hurt Tom defensively, but in a very graphic manor.

I've helped her and her husband financially for approximately 2  years with the child care payment for my lovely grand daughter (she is 3 years old). I explained to both of them (daughter and her husband), that I'd have to quit paying half the payment (273.00 per month), after I get my 2005 tax return, because I'm planning on buying a new car.  I need a smaller car, and the one I own is from 1995 SUV.  I gave my older car to my nephew in Arizona.  He was driving a 1985 Toyota with no air conditioning.  He is thrilled to recieved my 1995 Passport (Honda), that has many miles, but no serious problems. I was babysitting my lovely granddaughter one Saturday night.  When they came home from a party. My son in law stunk of weed and he was drunk.  He was hugging his daughter (my granddaughter), while he was stoned and drunk.  I was so disappointed.  I come from the old school that pot is bad. Being that my daughter was promoted to full time, and they both received a total of 2,000.00 tax return, I figure this is a good time to let them know that I'll no longer be paying for half their child care. My daughter blames my decision on the night her husband was very stoned ... I tell her that I can't expect ""the best"" for my granddaughter, when her own father doesn't care, as much as I do.  Plus, I had forewarned her that I'll be buying a car soon.  So ... now I have a new car .. but no daughter, and not granddaughter.  None of them are speaking to me.

1,"Am i a bad friend? I don't know what to do Recently two friends of mine (dating) have cut me off entirely without providing a reason... Let's call them J and K. J is an old friend from years back, when we were kids, and K has been my friend since highschool (approx. Six years). Its happened before that they've cut me off periodically for no given reason, then their idea of making up is inviting me to a party and never speaking of the weeks or months that they had me blocked on social media, when i ask them to explain they get defensive, and say things along the lines of ""you KNOW what you did"" even when i try to explain that no, i actually don't. I've never consciously done anything to hurt them, the one thing i thought it could be was that I'm friends with a girl they dislike, but after recently confronting J its apparently not just that, there's a long list of reasons why I'm a terrible friend but he ""doesn't have time to list them"" or even name one. Feeling insecure about this I've confided in other friends who assure me that I'm not a bad friend, although I've asked that they tell me if i ever act like a bitch. Back to K and J, they recently went so far as to invite all 3 of my siblings along with a crowd of people they barely know to their housewarming, but made a point to exclude me- when my brother asked why the response was along the lines of I'm ""acting like a bitch"". I've tried just cutting them out but its hard after being friends (i think) for so many years. I've tried extending olive branches, explaining that i don't know what I've done wrong and if they could at least tell me then maybe i could apologize/fix the situation, but J responded with passive aggression and K, so far, hasn't responded at all. (Quite frankly i don't expect her to). Bottom line is, should i just cut them off entirely? Its hard since I'll be seeing a lot of K this year as we're studying the same course, and J is one of my brother's best friends. Please help ",Airvian.txt

0,"Medicines can and do stop working. I am going though this right now. I suffer from chronic depression. Had it since I was 5 and I am now 42 so I have been suffering for 37 years. God, I never realized how long it was! I sat in therapy for 4 years after my ex attempted to hang himself. I saved his life by taking him down from the noose with the help of my brother. The first words out of his mouth when he was out of his coma and the swelling went down was that it was all my fault. I knew then it was ME who needed the help. So for 4 years I sat in therapy and they never diagnosed me with chronic depression. If they did, they never told me or put me on medicines. When I switched therapists, that was when she said that I needed medicines. They gave me Prozac. That made a HUGE difference after the first 3 weeks. I took that for 6 years. Then I had gastric bypass surgery and when you have that, your body doesn't absorb the same so it stopped working. I took effexor for a while, did nothing, and now on celexa which is doing nothing at all. I am sitting here reading this forum and crying. So basically, medicines CAN stop working.

1,"So there's this life I'm living, and only some know about parts of it, and I can't really write yet about any of it. Every time I find somewhere I think I'm comfortable writing, someone steps in and takes that feeling away, swiftly and murderously. I like to write, it's obvious, I've been doing it for years, but I like to write what I want, about whatever I want, and it's hard to do so while striving for anynomity. I hate having to hide behind a mask of unrecognizable features, just to tell the story of my life. The true story of my life, no frills, no strings attached, the real deal. But there some who who'd most definitely not approve, and though I can't blame her for getting upset at the things I do and think about, I can't help it, it's just how I am. It's the life I live, and I'm still not being very specific. Do you know, that if she were to read this, she'd hound me until the year's end asking what I'm talking about, what things in my life I do but can't write about, what would upset her, blah blah, and we all know how that goes, surely. So instead, I find another spot, and take my time trying to find comfort in that spot, with intent to eventually just write everything. I tire of taking out a pen and notebook, jotting everything down, while knowing I'm the only one who gets to read it. I'm a bit conceited, self-centered maybe, when I say I want others to hear my story, too. That's what these sites are all about, though, writing as a sort of entertainment towards others. That's just what we all like to do.  So with that all said, give me a few more entries where no one specifically is asking me anything, and I'll start writing about the real thing. Until then, please bare with my rambling. ",4126510.200408090.male.26.txt
1,"My dad is about to be 65. I'm scared suddenly at the age, and I'm sad because the last few years I wasted and didn't see him enough. He's a very healthy, smart person. Do I still have quality years for us to do activities together? Wondering if anyone can tell me it's all going to be okay in the sense that 65 is not that old, and that I still have time to make memories and learn from my dad at his age. I'm 26. The concept of him having nothing new to teach me and needing me to take care of him now is truly devastating, because it's hitting me how much time has gone by, and just the idea of me being more capable than my father is a bit scary. He's healthy, smart, independent, wise. He still seems the same as he always did except for being a bit more gray, and you can see the age in his face a bit clearer. He drives himself around, works, volunteers, has a long distance relationship. He just seems to be a bit upset and nervous about the state of my life. Like I'm always complaining and yammering about something and it's hard on him. Yet all he wants to do is help me, so he keeps trying, and every time, he just gets put through the ringer and it's hard on him. I feel so bad because I say very harsh things and he's such a fragile person, trying so hard to be tough in this world. And I know shocking the system when you're old is hard on you. So I'm trying to just be mature, put all of the mess behind me, and ensure evevery time him and I are together now, he can see that I'm all good, grown up, and not going to make everything bad for him again.

I actually didn't even start seeing her until the worst of my depression had already passed. Not sure I got that much out of it, but maybe I didn't give it enough time. I was doing so well for a while, but in the last week or two, I can feel myself sliding back into it. There are certain things, issues, that tend to pull me into that hole. I'd done so well at avoiding them, I felt like I was over it. But I'm dwelling on them again, and I don't know what to do this time to break the hold. The smallest thing sets me off crying, and I've completely lost interest in the things I was so excited about two weeks ago, along with most everything else.

0,"Aha! moment during therapy So I've been meeting with a therapist about once a week since October of 2017. It's been really great, and has helped pull me from the brink more than once. Background: I'm gay, and was raised Catholic in the 90s. Guess what happened next! Spoiler: I was bullied mercilessly. If I wasn't too gay, I was too fat, or too tall, or too weird or too unpopular. You get the gist. It it wasn't my hair, it was my mannerisms; if it wasn't my high voice, it was the dark circles under my eyes. (Gee, what could have caused me to be losing sleep?) Flash forward to today: My therapist guided me through a meditation today that instructed me to visualize and speak to a younger version of myself. I described what I looked like, what characteristics defined me, and how I saw myself. Then I was instructed to, as myself as the adult I've become, speak to that child and tell him what I was feeling. I spoke with kindness and compassion and love and respect for that child, and told him everything would be alright. I told him that all of that hatred was wrong, that it was incorrect and that those people who say all those nasty hurtful things, they probably aren't even going to remember saying it, so don't waste your time holding onto it. And it got me thinking about all of the baggage I've he'd onto my life. All the glances and side comments and nasty, hateful things. And how I've internalized it, and believed it. And that's when the Aha! moment came. *All this time, I've been so worried about all the bullying that other people did, I wasn't even thinking about all the bullying I did to myself.* https://media.giphy.com/media/12KiGLydHEdak8/giphy.gif All this time, *it was me.* Sure, it was other people who planted those seeds, but it was me who perpetuated it, who told myself that they were true. After all, if you say something enough, it might as well be as true as anything else. So there it is. There's one step. It might just be one step, but it's a step in the right direction. There's my holy shit moment of the day, and I just wanted to share with you all. There is hope. There is progress. There is love. And I hope you all are able to find it. ",CPUihlein.txt

1,"My husband is not my best friend. Friends jealous of friends. My husband isn’t my best friend and that’s ok. In fact, it’s more than ok. Yes, he is my friend but our connection is deeper than that. We are building our lives as one. Sharing our day to day, filling them with constant support and security. I love my husband deeply but we are also different people. He plays video games and I do arts and crafts. He watches war movies and I go to brunch. I value my friendships &amp; consider them a priority in a different light than the priority my spousal relationship takes. Because of our many differences, I take and make the time to build on my friendships. If their partners are their best friends, I am truly so happy for them. What a beautiful thing to find. However, I tend to notice that those are the friends that often get jealous of my other friendships or the plans I make with others. I hope that I make it clear how much they mean to me because that is all I can do. I don’t have a live-in best friend. I don’t spend all of my hours or all of my days with my partner. I have different people in my life for different reasons. I love them all. I think my biggest insecurity/worry is that feeling that I’m sometimes expected to put my life, needs or other friendships on hold while those with “partner bffs” hang out with their bffs. Not everyone can understand, so I have to teach myself to let go of the guilt. Truthfully though I just reaaaaallly wish my friends with bff partners could understand so they’d stop getting jealous. They want me to be and still call me their best friend but they already have one. We were “best friends” till they found their partners and I harbor zero resentment for that, all I want is happiness for all of us. Sure you can have more than one best friend, but I simply don’t take their priority anymore.  But so I have to move on, ya know? I keep in touch and try to maintain our friendship but when I get closer to a different friend it angers them in a way. If I make plans for a trip with a different friend I am ridden with guilt. Do I just tell myself to get over it? I’m doing my best? I know there’s nothing but love on my part. So it’s not truly my problem, right? (Easier said than done with that mindset though) TLDR: my friends boyfriends/fiancés are their best friends. They get jealous of me getting close with or making plans with other friends while theyhangs with their bff partners. Not my fault right? ",GrittyBraces.txt

1,"A Question About Honesty in Communication My friend recently graduated from Business school with a degree after 3 or 4 years. However, she continually asks me very simple, basic business questions that many non-business majors would know, stuff that I would think would've been covered over the first few classes. She's originally from a different country and still struggles a bit with English yet she went to school in Canada where all the courses were taught in English. The way I see it, if there was that much of a language barrier, she wouldn't have been able to pass. Even if she had gotten help with her studies, she still would have needed to retain this knowledge long enough to pass her exams, which weren't that long ago. The only thing I can fathom is that she had other people doing her work for her and taking her exams but I don't want to believe that and, besides, it's a bit of a stretch. As well, she currently has a mentor who's supposedly helping her conduct business research, yet she still messages me with questions about assignments they've given her, saying she doesn't understand basic stuff. I even told her that if she doesn't understand what her mentor is assigning her, she should be forthright and tell them, otherwise they wouldn't be able to fully help her. She agreed but I noticed she's still asking me the same questions insteading of contacting her mentor. Anyone have any insight into this? I've brought up similar things with her that I felt didn't make sense or were inconsistent but she's rarely honest, preferring to answer dismissively or cryptically.

1,"Friend slipping up at work. I talked to her and now she’s creating a bad environment for me. I’ll call my ex friend Mary.  We met at work.  I really valued our friendship because it’s hard for me to make friends.  I had a few hurt me in the past, so I became guarded.  Plus, I had to leave behind true ones when I moved away from my hometown 3 years ago.  About a year and a half ago, she started dating a new guy.  They seemed to have an ok relationship.  After a year of dating, they started having problems.  Mary spent every lunch hour complaining about him the entire time.  She stopped asking me how I was, always steering the conversation toward her bf.  I tried to be there for her, hugging her and reassuring her she’ll be ok.  She would be like, yeah I know but...then continue complaining about him.  She admitted to nagging him, and he eventually got sick of it and broke up with her.  She was a mess, crying at work, sometimes not even coming in.  I felt bad for her but it was the same thing over and over all the time, and I ran out of stuff to say.  Not to be offensive toward women (I am one, after all), but being the environment it is, word about Mary’s breakup traveled fast, and all our coworkers went up to Mary to comfort her. She leaned heavily on four of them, who often came up to her desk and asked if she wanted to talk.  Mary stopped hanging out with me and started spending a lot of time with them.  Mary would say yes when they offered to talk to her at work and they’d talk for like a half hour or longer (my desk is next to hers, so that’s how I knew).  I would also see Mary huddled in the hallways talking to these women a lot.  It affected Mary’s work.  She started taking on less work (claiming she was overwhelmed) and not being around (she would go off to find one of the women), so the rest of us would be left to answer her calls or speak to her clients on her behalf.  Our boss is very hands off and is a poor manager so he has no idea, and my coworkers just excuse Mary because they feel bad for her and don’t wanna tell our boss.  But because she and I handle certain cases that only she and I know how to deal with, it’s usually me who’s left to pick up the extra slack.  This went on for 3 months.  Honestly, if she wasn’t a friend, I might gone to our boss, but I decided to talk to Mary about it.  It didn’t go well. She got defensive, denied that she was slipping up, and accused me of being a bad friend cuz I wasn’t there for her during this difficult time.  I tried to point out examples of her slipping up and she denied it again.  I also told her she wasn’t there for me when my friend committed suicide or my dad had a health scare which left him disabled.  She just responded that she was left in so much despair from the breakup that she wasn’t capable of being unselfish enough to be a friend.  We both walked away mad.  She started ignoring me completely.  I didn’t think I was wrong but I still felt bad.  As this was around Christmas time, I decided to extend an olive branch by giving her a small Christmas gift and card that just said I was sorry and I hoped she had a merry Christmas.  The next day, she said thanks and we’d talk soon.  The day after that, she was back to ignoring me.  Now she doesn’t speak to me or even look at me, just pretends I’m not there.  I can’t say for sure, but I get the feeling that she told our coworkers about our conversation (I haven’t told anyone at work about it) cuz I now get the cold shoulder from some of them, too, when just the day before, we were all ok.  They, in front of me, make a show of hugging Mary and offer food to each other but not to me.  I even got a dirty look from one of the women, too.  Sigh, I don’t know what to do.  Any advice?

I only have about two hours of class per day and no job so I have tons of free time to waste away. I analyzed what I did in the past hour and it basically went like this: The entire time I was talking to myself non-stop, analyzing things, analyzing my situation, thinking of motivational quotes etc.... I tend to do that all day. For about 15 minutes I stood around leaning against a wall, the next 15 minutes i leaned against the television, then I went and lied down for a while all while still thinking and analyzing things in my head, then I came on the computer to just look at random, pointless things. And that is pretty much how most of my time is spent, I might spend an hour or so just standing around or sitting doing nothing but thinking or daydreaming, that can't possibly be healthy and I obviously have way too much free time, I'm just not sure if this is what is in turn causing all my fatigue and sickness. Have I become so addicted to this lifestyle that my mind will purposely make me feel sick so I have an excuse to live like this? ",killingtime_e_2_a_1_xx.txt
0,"An Open Letter Dear you, It's been three years since we decided to go our separate ways. We both had different goals, desires and aspirations. We were perfect together, but just at the wrong time. I'm sorry things ended badly. I'm sorry that for months after they spiraled out of control. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I let you down, your family down. I'm sorry I buckled. I'm sorry I didn't have the experience or the know-how to react to certain situations. I'm sorry that I made mountains out of molehills. I'm sorry at times I treated you badly, that at times I held you back. Three years later, we live totally different lives than back then. I got that job. I traveled the world. I went to Italy - twice. I've been to Times Square at midnight, and so have you. I did it all, but by myself. It's not what I wanted. It's not what I envisioned. You can't just replace somebody special with another person, and that you were. Special. It's been three years. Despite some triumphs and successes, it still feels like I lost a war. An immense failure that didn't personify my persona, it personified myself. On the surface, I'm told I seem ambitious, fully ready to attack each day. On the inside, I feel defeated. In the end, you found somebody new, which is fine. I chose, whether consciously or unconsciously to stay on a different path. I've tried new women. Many beautiful on the outside, but they aren't you. Oh no, no, no. They all don't have what you had. Not even close. Maybe one day I will end this crusade against myself, against the past. I can't change it, I can't alter the story, I can't lie to myself. I wish I could tell you I'm sorry. But it wouldn't change anything. For you it's a battle that was fought long ago. For me, I relive it more times than I'd care to admit. I'm emotionally crippled, distraught, defeated. It's been a long three years. I'm ready for it to be over. I'm sorry. Yours truly, Me.

0,"Feeling numb I’ve realized that if I can’t talk to someone about my feelings then the next best thing is to write them down and seek advice from reddit so here I am. I’m on campus right now preparing for my midterm and my confidence is at an all time low. I haven’t even seen the paper and already I feel as if I’ve lost. I never thought I would reach such a low in my life. Something weird happened today. I finally set up a countdown timer to the day my exam results are announced. That seemed like the next logical step and it made complete sense to me in a weird way. The only thing that made me remove that was talking to my parents and seeing the hope and love for me in their eyes. I know my life isn’t truly mine and that if I hurt myself then I also hurt other people but it’s just getting too much. The thought is always there in my mind and for the past few days that voice has gotten stronger. I’ve been through this period before and had come out nearly unharmed and at the beginning of the year I was feeling optimistic about what’s to come but that lasted all of one month. The future I was dreaming of looks bleak and distant and with every passing minute that future keeps on going farther and farther away from me. I try very hard to keep my guard up near people I know and love but it’s becoming harder and harder to do so. I used to think that I was destined to do some good in the world but maybe that was just me being delusional. It’s getting harder to keep the tears in. Whenever I used to feel numb, I used to punch the wall just to feel something but even that is not helping now. All I wanna do is talk to someone and pour my heart out but I don’t know if I have the strength left to do that. Getting out of bed is starting to feel like a struggle and for the first time in a while I’m afraid of myself, of what I might do if things don’t go my way. I know that this is not the end of the line but why does it feel like it is? How can anyone recover from such a failure? It’s gotten so bad that I would much rather prefer that I disappeared than having to tell my parents what’s wrong. Depression is nothing new for my university and it wouldn’t be the first time that someone took a drastic step and now I know why they did what they did. The pressure and stress which comes with a university as respected as mine, is just too much to handle. I’m almost inclined to reveal my university’s name just in case someone’s able to figure out who I am and I can finally get the respite I desire so much. All around me I see happy faces and I can only hope that one day I can leave all this behind me and be happy but in the meantime I guess I just have to struggle on and wait for the light at the end of the tunnel.

I was driving downtown and I noticed someone on the opposite side of the railing. My girlfriend was in the passenger seat and before I could say anything to her. They were gone. I didn't get to see their face and if I did I think it would've destroyed me. I crossed the bridge, pulled over and called the police. I wish I could've helped, yelled something, gotten out of my car. I don't know. I didn't even know her but I feel as though I've lost someone close.

Ive been in a dark place for a long time but im the kind of person who channels this into humor so not even my family could tell. I just turned 20 yesterday and ive been depressed for about 2 years now. I havent opened up to anyone about it because i keep brushing it aside thinking it would pass but it just keeps getting worse. Today i realized something that made me genuinely cry, i seriously didnt remember the last time i was myself. I used to be super carefree and relaxed, i was full of energy and would answer any call to chill in seconds. I just asked my close friend when was the last time he remembers the real me and he said it was the beginning of college and im currently finishing my second year. Its been getting progressively worse in the last 6 months with a serious drop in my appetite.  I also started feeling anxiety for the first time in my life and suicidal thoughts are uncommon Ive lost about 10 pounds in 2 months because of this. My grades also took a hard hit, going from a 3.0 gpa every semester to a 1.7. I just had a talk with my mom and she told me that im being ungrateful and that i need to get my shit together (ironic considering she suffered depression for years until i pushed her to divorce my father).  Im not blaming her at all for my situation because she was raised by two hardasses so i understand why its hard for her to understand why a teen would be depressed. I know that life is worth it and it gets better but i really cant keep the darkness out of my head.

0,"ok, so today i had another freak out. I woke up feeling good ... it was supposed to be my first therapy session (which i and my boyfriend were happy about) and then after this i was supposed to meet up with my boyfriend for lunch, check my test marks, and then go to the library with my boyfriend to study. These plans changed... When i walked into the therapy office, they said no appointment was scheduled. All of a sudden i felt really rejected, not worthy of an appointment (like they gave it to someone else), anxious, sick to my stomach, a little dizzy. I've been waiting since February for this appointment! I couldn't deal with my anger properly or the fact that my plans for therapy were ruined today. I started stuttering kind of i kind of got all dazed out and really sick when the receptionist wanted to schedule another appointment. So, it's tomorrow at 9am ... 9am!!! What bastards. Anyway, so because i got all weird ... i didn't want to be around people. I called my boyfriend ... couldn't get a hold of him. I cancelled .... didn't check my marks, didn't go to the library, or lunch or see my boyfriend. I left. I told my boyfriend i had bad anxiety. So, now he wants a ""break."" And I've been in my room since i got home (since about 1pm) .... feeling really low and weird and lightheaded .... I've been rocking a lot too on my rocking chair ... it's a weird compulsive soothing mechanism i have. Don't ask. I'm mad at my boyfriend because he decided to take a break when i needed him most.

I just assumed it was just life getting in the way, but recently my dad tried to contact this cousin about some money he loaned him to buy my old car (which I sold to him well under half of market value), because my dad needed the money to pay for a surgery (he has stage 4 liver cirrhosis). My cousin never replied and money aside I can tell this really hurt my dad (he's bottling it, but I can tell) considering this is my Dad's favorite nephew. I feel like this is my cousin throwing a bit of a tantrum over having to be an adult (he just barely turned 19) and I texted him to call me when got off work to explain how serious my fathers illness is (our grandma died of the same condition) and how he shouldn't cut off his uncle who has done a lot for him, but it's been 3days already. My main motivation for this is that I know stage 4 cirrhosis can move to end stage very suddenly and I want my dad to have as few regrets and worries during what may be God forbid his last few years.

1,"this title is more of what i am looking for than what i am offering. i was looking for a way to start some good conversations on this topic but was unsure as to where i should go to do so....until now. so, that is what i am wondering. personally, i think that for the most part, the church has missed the point over the last 500 years or so but this has become more evident in recent years, as illustrated by this excerpt from ""Blue Like Jazz"":       ""In a recent radio interview I was sternly asked by the host, who did not consider himself a Christian, to defend Christianity. I told him that I couldn’t do it, and moreover, that I didn’t want to do defend the term. He asked me if I was a Christian and I told him yes. “Then why don’t you want to defend Christianity?” he asked, confused. I told him I no longer knew what the term meant. Of the hundreds of thousands of people listening to his show that day, some of them had terrible experiences with Christianity, they may have been yelled at by a teacher in a Christian school, abused by a minister, or browbeaten by a Christian parent. To them, the term Christianity meant something that no Christian I know would defend. By fortifying the term, I am only making them more and more angry. I won’t do it. Stop ten people on the street and ask them what they think of when they hear the word Christianity and they will give you ten different answers. How can I defend a term that means ten different things to ten different people? I told the radio show host that I would rather talk about Jesus and how I came to believe that Jesus exists and that he likes me. The host looked back at me with tears in his eyes. When we were done, he asked me if we could go get lunch together. He told me how much he didn’t like Christianity but how he had always wanted to believe Jesus was the son of God.""    i am not saying that i disagree with the teaching of Jesus nor with that of the Bible but rather with the fundamental ring-wing Christianity of the 20th century. what are your thoughts on christian spirituality?

My life has been one failure after another, in relationships, jobs, and anything else. I had been on antidepressants for about 10 years and then stopped after I got arrested for a DUI and felony hit and run. The man who was injured received a cut on his face after chasing after me when I split the scene, that was the whole extent of his injuries. After the arrest I was feeling so bad it made no difference whether I took them or not. The charges were dropped but I had to wait day after day for a year or more just waiting for them to recharge me, which my attorney was sure they were going to do. That was 2 years ago and I think the experience did some very serious and real damage to me. I just lost my job in my probationary period of 2 months. I have worked so hard to create some kind of financial security for myself (BA in Psychology, technical degree in computers, numerous computer certifications) but where ever I go I don't fit in to the group and find myself alienated and let go. Some many failed romantic relationships, never having friends, and what family members I have are abusive and are incapable of providing healthy support. Most nights I calm myself enough to fall asleep by fantasizing about killing myself and the relief that was provide. I feel like a freak physically. I shortened my fingers on my right hand by 1/2 inch and my hand is deformed because I hit the wall in my apartment one night about 4 years ago after I was let go from a job and my girlfriend broke up with me at the same time. Of course what I have stated so far isn't close to all that is weighing on me. Now I am just so tired and hopeless I don't know how to get the energy to try again.
